<p align="center">Cyberpunk 2077 is the new Cyberpunk game, and it was released a month ago (December 10, 2020). These last few days, I‚Äôve seen many negative reviews, so I was curious to know what the gamers think.

## üßê Insights

- The story seems to be compelling, amazing but short.

- The gameplay seems to be nothing new to some and enjoyable to others.

- There are some graphical glitches and bugs. Some are minor but others may be major or game-breaking. Some are even funny?

- They talk a lot about the characters‚Äô customization, personality, and memorableness.

- Combat, hacking, and gunplay seem to be fun.

- The world is detailed and vibrant. The visuals are also gorgeous and visually stunning.

- Maybe the driving system is not good.

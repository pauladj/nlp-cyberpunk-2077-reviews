1610117378,Funny man go shoot
1610117348,"Lots of glitches but at least for me they take nothing away from the game. I really hope they add the cut content back in but CDPR will definitely keep working on the game. They are good devs, its not fair that their board forced them to do an early release."
1610117399,"would only reccomend if they are planning a redux in june, that includes cut content & better police AI system & better overall

currently for me:
* hotfix 1.06 introduced me a slush of bugs not presented in 1.0
* hotfix 1.06 forces me to switch off RTX because of performances, previously on 1.05 still can get avg 50fps
* no replay value added
* no new game plus either
* have to resort to nexusmods to improve play
* character customizations felt lackluster
* limited exploration areas

would come back again if devs willing to do a redux.. if not, i wont be playing this crap anyttime soon"
1610117220,"Despite all of the negative buzz, I have had a very positive experience with this game,  with very little in the way of bugs breaking immersion (on my mid-tier PC)."
1610116954,"It's a bugged and technically very broken experience. It runs ok on my PC with GTX1080, but you will see yourself regularly clipping through objects, walls and getting stuck inside the world. You will see NPC's dissapearing in front of you, you will see NPC's clipping through stuff, cars wrecking eachother, NPC's doing the weirdest of shit and A.I. being absolute garbage. It's like TES: Morrowind bad A.I. that can be cheesed in numerous ways and doesn't make any sense. Physics are very off, cars don't break from hits, some NPC's and cars are seemingly unaffected by grenades and the list goes on and on.

Still it's a fun game with great quests so far. I'm not in the end of the game yet, but I do enjoy going deep for all the possible quests, cybermodifications and weapons.

It's nowhere near what was promised or marketed before the release, but as itself Cyberpunk 2077 is definitely a fun experience. It's not a physics simulator where you can test out funny shit, it's not an next gen open world experience and it's not the worlds greatest shooter. But it is an enjoyable semi-linear, futuristic RPG placed in an openesque world, with great written quests and fun mechanics."
1610116751,"The core of the game is honestly fun, but the glitches make the experience inconsistent as it constantly breaks your immersion. If you've waited this long already to purchase (1/8/2021), I'd suggest just holding out for a few more months until the kinks get ironed out for the best experience. 

That being said; I've nearly 100%'d the game and absolutely loved it. Glitches were frustrating sometimes, causing quests to not finish, etc, but the core gameplay mechanics were all fun and enjoyable. Gunplay could use some work, but chaining together quickhacks with melee/stealth kills and occasional headshots from absurd distances are fun and feel rewarding when accomplished without errors. The game is (obviously) heavy on dialogue due to the nature of it being an open-world RPG, but you'll find yourself easily drawn into the stories of the inhabitants of Night City.  Wait for patches and then enjoy what will ultimately be a great cyberpunk experience 6 months from now. Looking forward to"
1610116619,"*NOT recommended for any console or low specs*
I would recommend the game as a good, blind one-off futuristic sci-fi adventure game. Not really anything beyond that. 

Overall the game isn't terrible, if you didn't expect to pick at it for all the things it lacks or tries to boast or, even just simple things it could use as QoL but for whatever reason it doesnt. 

The game does have good overall looks, looks of the city and surroundings and character design/placement/personalization. For every character BUT V, that is. 

Even Fallout 4 and New Vegas had more protagonist customization than this game does! Yet it made it a point to be one of the only games to give you the choice to have genitalia...with no overworld third person cameraview period, making that feature entirely pointless, as you can never see it anyway unless you...for whatever reason, just like unequipping all the clothes in your inventory screen paperdoll and staring indefintely..

The combat and generic ""cop"" missions is...imbalanced to say the least. I see a lot of comments say the stealth is garbage, but honestly the stealth system in combat is absolutely broken and with the right equipment the stealth with a silenced gun makes the majority of generic enemies quick headshot fodder. If you do happen to be discovered, most enemies after a while seem to just take cover and hide unless youre in plain sight. Making having a katana as an alternate weapon interesting to blitz netrunners and that sort, since their AI for whatever reason just...crouches in one spot behind something. As is making and using quickhacks especially with that.


I can definitely say that, the decisions with the storyline is the biggest drawback of the game by far; a game whose very city in all angles and even outside the city promotes freedom, even to do the things that you shouldnt probably do.

Regardless of which life V chooses as backstory, after the initial starting section, the storylines of all three all become the same, and, there is only the illusion of V having multiple dialogues in almost every major quest, when they all only lead to the same scene, just with a different sentence of dialogue between in response.  The only thing your backstory choice actually affects, is occasionally you get a bonus choice of dialogue in scenes that is only available to each background. (though even they do not actually change the next scene that happens) 

There is seven endings, and regardless of which class you are, the conclusion of the game is the same in all but one where you help Johnny, again except for the ending dlalogue and scenes. 

This actually makes it have basically, 0 replay value beyond completing everything in the game one time, or maybe seeing the times the Corpo, Kid or Nomad's life gives you that special choice in a convo. Maybe two, to get the pro Johnny ending sequence.   And I wouldnt even say its a great game to play as far as for enjoying the story, if futuristic anti-establishment technological chaos isnt something youd be interested in. 

In actuality, as I played for the first time, I was DISCOURAGED from playing any of the main storylines hardly-- because I noticed Johnny Silverhand's virus only spreads, and that element that you are hard introduced to at the start of Chapter 2, only advances much from doing the main storyline quests.  It does not spread while doing any of the fixer's side missions (except for a select few that also deals with Johnny's past), or while doing any of the NCPD street quests---- and there are so many of those everywhere, that you can spend a hundred hours running around popping thugs in the head in silence with a muzzled revolver, before you ever even do a single Chapter 2 story mission. 

I cannot downvote the game for bugs. Honestly aside from the very rare hard crash of the game, i have had almost NO bugs at all on PC, save for the rare random clip or amusing graphical error for a few moments.

 The only two real hard bugs i've experienced is, 1) I cannot pick up any item period that is underneath a body or other object, though I can see what it is as if I could. and 2) there is a scrolling glitch in the Backpack when dismantling weapons only. Where it scrolls down forcefully into Hell then suddenly justifies again. 

 I have Intel i 7600-K / Nvidia GeForce 1060 ATX, 1080p and the game is on hard disk, not SSD. (Very amusingly being on HDD seems to have no effects on this game's loading/smoothness). But im also not trying to play the game on 4K picture either. That and the collision box, and endurance of vehicles is very disproportionate. I like how one time an entire long armored miltary hummer just pops a wheelie overtop my Delamain trying to go forward in an intersection. I have also had no bugs with missions or other jobs not completing, except for very few missions where you have to complete the steps of the mission in a fixed order, or it would not recognize that you completed the step. 

This game is NOT new player friendly, beyond the basic first ""tutorial"" mission with Jackie. You will spend some hours getting used to where to go, what you can do, how to get better weapons, as you explore, and die exploring. Fortunately there is no penalty for dying; you just go back to your last autosave. 

The killing of enemies, because who uses the non-lethal takedown---the interesting thing is: even if you use non-lethal takedown, or lethal, or even stealth snipe them in the CPU, when theyre laying ""dead""...it doesnt matter! theyre still alive, and their eyes and mouth move in incoherence either way--  and THEN if you even so much as tap them after that, you see them flop over, actually dead--- Kind of makes the ""non lethal/lethal"" mechanic a little pointless, doesnt it. 

The game certainly does not live up to the hype and play of Witcher 3 by any means, and if you're looking for that in the game you best reassess. 

A lot of time was wasted on some mechanics that do not really deliver their purpose; or are contradicted by other game mechanics that more try to express the nature of freedom in the game; instead of putting the time to making mechanics that are useful or do deliver. Other mechanics of the game are ok or fitting at least.

That being said, even though you cant actually enter the facades of all that vast expanse of city and wilderness in most places lol, there is a few hundreds ours worth of it to behold, if exploration and mindless adventuring and questing is your cup of tea, and for that I would recommend it as it is. 

Hopefully, the game will be built upon and sorted out more in time, and without releasing it as DLCs, like most other games these days *cough*

1610116408,buggy
1610116201,"This review can be changed after further patch.

I did not play the story, only testing the game. This review is not about the performance as for me, it is not an issue. I'm running this game with a CPU Ryzen 5 3600 with a GPU AMD MSI RX 5700 XT MECH OC

The game run fine at 1440p Custom settings with Fidelity i can get around 70 fps, without it i can hit the 60.

Where i'm not okay with is the huge amount of bug. Dont get me wrong, the game is curently fully playable. But it is not enjoyable. Due to the huge amount of visual bug, ai bug, audio bug etc etc, I just simply cannot recommend this game until fully patch. This game remind me of No man sky. The game was so bad at first. I took like what? 2 years to be no man sky 2.0?

Never Ever Release a game that you know it is not finished. Who care about people wining about it. Just dont do it and finish your game!"
1610115924,is good
1610115834,"This could easily be the best game I've ever played. The potential is there, when it is finally out of early access you guys should 100% buy it. They promised much more than they could deliver to us in that timeframe. Please wait until it is finished to purchase it."
1610115820,"Fun game
It has a lot of bugs and glitches and a dumb AI but it's still fun to play"
1610114911,very nice
1610114890,"Actually an amazing game. The combat and stealth mechanics are fun. Quickhacks, not so much. Aesthetics is a given. A quarter of my game time's actually just turning off the HUD, driving around freely, and gazing upon the beauty of Night City, and recorded a lot of it too.

The story's not bad, the characters are interesting and the dialog are well-written. I sometimes find myself moved, shocked, or blowing air through my nose. The game's not short like most people are saying unless you deliberately skipped the side jobs which contribute a lot to the story and character development.

Luckily, I didn't encounter any game-breaking bugs, just your casual T-posing NPC's.

Also, I recommend installing the Cyberrunner ReShader mod for a true Cyberpunk visuals. Adjust your Gamma settings to your liking."
1610114716,Great Game despite complaints from the masses.
1610114548,"Game has a steep learning curve, plenty of early cutscenes and a brutal and depressing end to Act 1.  Once onto the main sequence, give yourself a bit of time to comprehend each of the various sub-systems (inventory, cyberdeck, cyberware, crafting etc..), and the game will reward you with the kind of openworld a Witcher veteran wants.  There are still bugs and at my mediocre hardware level you have to work hard to maintain the suspension of disbelief with the Keanu / Silverhand character - I try to just listen to him rather than look at him - but overall, I am enjoying myself and am optimistic about the game."
1610114518,I don't give a shit what anybody says - especially the SJW land whales - this game is the shiz-nit!!! Good job devs!!
1610114184,"Night City was a fun place to visit, but past that, the game's pretty lame. Poorly designed game structure, mediocre plot, and painfully slow character progression. If you're a curious cat, at least wait for a major steam sale."
1610113530,"Yes, there is some issues with the game, some bugs and so on (it will be fixed i'm sure, just needs a little bit more time), but the story line, characters, soundtrack, the world of Night City and everything else is just perfect, masterpiece, this is art! One of the best games ever, truly are!

10/10 even with the bugs

GOTY
PERIODT"
1610113483,"Play it, all the bad press is overblown and click baitey. It is honestly a little short, don't rush through the main story quests,"
1610113425,"Good game if you have the hardware to support it. Absolutely gorgeous, good storyline and liberty, great design, Would have liked a few more interactive quests but it scratches the same itch that I had for skyrim and others like it."
1610113319,"It's true - it has a lot of flaws, and a lot of bugs that will, hopefully, get ironed out over the months to come.

For all that though - the character work is amazing, the story is great, The amount of work that must have gone into those alone is staggering. Night City is a fascinating creation, with never a dull moment, and fun stuff to find everywhere. 

The game is, in my opinion, half masterpiece, and half mess. For all the mess (and make no mistake - there's a lot of issues), I love playing it - and I hope that it keeps improving as the devs keep working on it."
1610113214,good
1610112947,Good story. fun missions with multiple solutions.
1610112810,"Pretty fun, but definitely not in the same league as The Witcher 3. 8/10"
1610112460,"short and sweet, i adore this game"
1610112311,"Its painfully obvious its another game with bugs, Regardless its still playable on PC."
1610112280,"Play it now, play it later, play it eventually. Cyberpunk 2077 is a rare game with a rare experience to present. Whether you're on board the wagon that wants this game to be better later, the one that wants to trash it, or the one that altogether has separated itself from the game to prevent disappointment---None of that matters. Whether you play it now or 5 years from now, this game has something special. The storytelling elements of this game rival Witcher 3 at its best and the combat in this game is intuitive and especially fun, minus the AI from time to time. This game is flawed without a doubt, but there's a grounded in reality quality to Cyberpunk 2077 that oozes out of its characters, its world, and its build up. The experience is often heart wrenching and mystical, feeling impressionable from the very beginning up until the bitter end."
1610112101,"Has its bugs, but overall enjoyed my first play through"
1610111432,"if you like a game that talks ""a lot of conversations that go on and on and on"" then this is for you."

1610109295,Buggy asf at the moment however easy to sink many hours into the story and gameplay
1610109239,"""impressive cock"" - Keanu Reeves"
1610109236,"Straightforward: To me this is the most captivating, memorable and moving game I've played in a decade. 

Disclaimer: You should not expect a sandbox open world like GTA nor a sandbox RPG like The Elder Scrolls (I haven't played the Witcher series, so I can't compare those games). The game is not about going on random inconsequential killing sprees in the middle of Los Santos, nor is it about looting the 87th dungeon. Cyberpunk 2077 excels at narrating protagonist V's fight for survival in dystopian Night City. It tells the story of how a pretentious no-name mercenary set to make a name for themself is suddenly faced with loss and, even worse, a menacing fate worse than death. And it's beautifully written. The adventures and the friends you make along the way are truly memorable. 

I have had a few crashes during my first playthrough (maybe one crash every three hours) but it didn't hurt much thanks to regular savegames. I've actually experienced very few glitches and zero game breaking bugs. The game ran smoothly on Max settings (minus raytracing) on my 1080Ti. Night City is beautifully crafted - from the enourmous skyscrapers, gigantuous megabuildings and shiny advertisements to the slums of Pacifica, from the starlit nights at the nomad camp to car races through dust storms - there is so much to see. The game's soundtrack is amazing (from Samurai's concert to different radio stations, from first meeting the Voodoo Boys in Pacifica to the end credits). 

The characters are written incredibly well, the way you form friendships with them, the way they share things, it feels natural. [spoiler] I couldn't help myself but liking Panam from the moment V first met her. I could feel Mama Welles' grief over her son at the funeral. Floating into the sunset with Kerry jamming on the guitar while opening up to V, Takemura sending a weird selfie thanking V for saving his life. Climbing up the water tower with River, going diving with Judy. These are only a few of the moments that stuck with me. I couldn't help myself to even love Johnny in the end. The relationship between him and V - from trying to kill her and being a huge a** to ""The Guy who Saved My Life"" and ""Goodbye V - never stop fightin'"" got me in tears. [/spoiler] The V I got to play is over-confident, hot-headed, boastful and yet genuine, caring and loyal. The screenwriters and the voice actors all deserve medals. 

Is there something not to like, is there room for improvement? I wish the first act would have been longer, the relationship with Jackie more fleshed out and I really wished they hadn't revealed a major plot twist years ago. Balancewise, halfway through the game my blade-wielding character became as powerful as a demi-god and the final boss fight lasted about ten seconds. 

I am looking forward to playing the DLCs, as Night City still has a million stories to tell. 

The ending: [spoiler] For my first playthrough/ ending I (female nomad lifepath) chose to ask Panam and the nomads for help. It was a deeply moving ending. Standing on the dam, it took me several minutes to say goodbye to Night City and during the car ride with Panam I reminisced about everything that happened since I first smuggled a lizard to Night City, the victories, the losses, the friendships I made and the lives I changed. And then at the stop.. all of a sudden there was Judy, and she was ready to join V and Panam and the nomads and leave NC for good. V and Panam sitting next to each other on the Basilisk, floating through the night gave me lots of hope for V's future, despite Alt's prognosis. Because the V I got to know will never stop fighting. [/spoiler]"
1610108706,I LOVE IT
1610108646,"The game is cool, and fun and all, I like it, there few bugs but over all is good, the graphics are amazing, the AI are dumb which makes the game realistic, since humans are dumb, let's not talk about the pigs, they are  so realistic, in a future where the era is shit, even pigs doesn't give a shit, so yea overall is a great game!! 10/10 only reason why I do not recommend this game is because my taste is shit, and whoever is sane wouldn't buy this game full of bugs"
1610108424,"Unlike others, I had set tame expectations for this game. Having played Witcher 3, I expected a great story and world but mediocre gameplay. I'm a bit pleasantly surprised with CDPR's first attempt at gunplay. Is the physics engine poor compared to Breath of the Wild and GTA 5? Absolutely. But it's strengths in world building, story telling, and quest depth make it an excellent RPG and one that will continue to improve through patches and expansions."

First of this is my opinion and you don't have to share it.
This game is amazing.
There are just a lot of small bugs and sometimes big bugs.
Not considering the bugs this game looks gorgeous.
It feels amazing to play this game and I would definitely recommend this game.
The game is worth buying at a 20% sale."
1610108255,Awesome fucking game. period.
1610107887,This game is just so damn good. Wish I had more time to play it
1610107497,"i know i have only played for 3 hours, but way to many visual bugs and many crashes have happened in these 3 hours. i believe that there is potential once this is fixed up"
1610107428,"Firstly, yes it is fairly buggy.

Its also a pain in the a** to run. (Not like I had to buy a new GPU or anything)

It was also overhyped for what it is and what you can do in the game.

Why the positive review then?

I enjoyed it. 

If you have a decent enough system and can put up with a few bugs here and again, you'll find a very captivating game.

The main story isn't particularly long but you'll find you are probably drawn to the stories of the side characters just as much.

The mechanics of the game are also fairly interesting to play around with. Not revolutionary by any means, but still impressive.

Overall, if you ignore the hype the game generated and play the game for what it is, you'll have a lot of fun."

1610106709,just no
1610106541,"Cyberpunk 2077 is well worth the money you pay for a AAA.  It has many flaws and does not do anything special that sets itself apart from the games it tries to emulate,  However, within this jumbled mess is a good storey which should be savoured like a fine wine not rushed just in a effort to say you completed the game.

I feel that there has been a huge amount of material cut from this game whether due to bugs or from a DLC standpoint where we can be charged once again for a game which was complete, but due to decisions made by execs parts have been cut out to pave way for a dlc release when sales wain.  

If you want to play everything which is offered then the game gives you a solid 50+ hours of gameplay."

I'm 14 hours in as of right now and there's already 40+ side missions. I'm able to play on ultra settings with a 4k 300Hz monitor and the graphics are amazing. It has a very immersive and emotional story line thus far. If you have the computer to run this game I absolutely recommend it."

Lets face it, x-mas season is THE season to sell stuff in the westerner world.

I know that CDRED will make good on the issue (no, not drinking their cool-aid) considering the scope of the project itself.  The game's end-credits alone scrolled through for 20-30+ minutes, that many hands/companies were involved! Cyberpunk 2077 is a good foundation - albeit bug-ridden/glitchy at the moment - for a setting rich in lore and world-building. It's hinted in-game what's to come, in the form of the TV News or other dialogues between NPCs.

Poor optimization, game breaking and non game breaking bugs, Very very limited open world interaction and it feels like a good portion of the content was left out of this game. Once some of these problems are fixed i could see myself giving this game a positive review and and recommending it to others."
1610103314,"I bought Assassin's Creed Valhalla (ps4) before Cyberpunk and after playing Cyberpunk, i couldn't go back to Valhalla. Cyberpunk is everything that an RPG should be imo. The customization, the quests, the dialogue, the minute details such as the passage of time in-game telling you when a quest is/isn't available is everything you'd expect from a CDPR game.
I played on normal difficulty and would still get somewhat battered by grunt enemies so the difficulty is pretty solid too imo.

I'd heartily recommend it if it wasn't for all the fps drops. Maybe it's just my rig (RX 570 4GB, Ryzen 3 2200g, 16GB RAM) but I have a hard time reaching even 30 fps on medium settings. The fps even dips down to the low 10s especially in Night City and that's just no bueno. The bugs and glitches are one thing, like cops mastering the art of instant transmission and teleporting behind you to bonk you in the head and send you to netrunner jail, like c'mon bro. idgaf about 60fps, just at least gimme a solid 30 and i'm good.

As it stands right now, the game doesn't seem very solid at least to me, I blew through the story because I just couldn't enjoy it, not at 15 fps no. There's talk of updates coming this year and if these patches iron out the optimization/performance issues, then I'm all for changing my outlook on the Cyberpunk 2077."
1610103153,"So... lets be real. Cyberpunk 2077 is a damn good game that is brought down by some very bad decisions by the devs. Cyberpunk 2077 rocks it, with engaging characters, fantastic and tense story, immersive world, and solid gameplay... when bugs don't drag you out of course. For me personally, bugs aren't a problem. I grew up with Skyrim, so in a way I find it charming, but I realize that isn't the case for everybody. 

On the downsides, bugs are an obvious flaw in an otherwise fantastic game. But some flaws are deeper, like the slew of features cut from the game, or the release state on Consoles. It's clear the game needed more time in the oven, and should have been next-gen exclusive, and not on baseline Xbox One and PS4 consoles. 

However, these flaws should not excuse tearing down all the good this game has. The biggest flaw surrounding this game is the increasingly absurdist claims and hate towards the game and its devs. Yes, this game has flaws, and yes things should have been done differently, but for what it is, it is a good game. Saying otherwise is naive, but ignoring its real flaws is just the same. Use your better judgement, and keep a level head. 

Overall, I strongly recommend this game, especially as it grows stronger over time with patches and bug fixes. Keep in mind that The Witcher III was buggy on release as well, and is now one of the most acclaimed games of the past generation. This game will no doubt be in the same spot half a year down the line."
1610103033,Had my doubts but after some settings tweaking and the patches this game is truly amazing and worth every Penny!
1610102990,"Yeah there are bugs, yes it kills older hardware but wow what a lavish and intricate rendering of a future city with some very deep customisation and all the side quests you could ever want before you complete the prologue!"
1610102930,"Feels like an early access game, but is very good good at its best. The characters are great, the story is interesting, but is currently very poorly optimized. I do enjoy the game, but it definitely does not feel finished."
1610103423,"At the moment, I'd be lying if I can recommend Cyberpunk 2077 as a Great game, it is a good game though I do like it but cannot recommend it in the current form. The game is good in terms of story, narration, and writing but when it comes down to exploring the world itself the game needs a lot of work as everything breaks when you are off rail like AI and the wanted system. It is obvious at this point that this game was rushed for the holiday season during Covid to push it out the door preventing it from truly being a great game. There are a slew of bugs and unfinished or cut content from this game that will leave you questioning wtf was going on with the mind of management behind this game. Perhaps with some more patches and fixes, we'll see this game make a comeback from its current form though only time will tell and it will take some time. I would def return to this game

☯Story☯
The story of the game is a hit or miss for some. I found that the story itself was well written and the pacing just a little off but the game starts with your lifepath and then ends with you knowing your best friend Jackie with a 6-month video that plays and starts with your typical heist and goes from there. Although the ending wasn't something that blew my mind what kept me engaged in the dialogue and characters acting in the game was phenomenal, they did not feel one-dimensional throughout.
The only problem with the story itself is that the impact factor isn't there in terms of the choices and lifepath you make in the game. The Life paths themselves do not alter too much of the player choices throughout the game but only in Dialogue, Whatever choices you pick means that you will have knowledge for certain dialogue choices which is pretty much it, i.e Oh you are Nomad you know about this and so on. Even with the six endings, I didn't feel the impact factor from the choices which is a shame they missed an opportunity with this the moment they lost the illusion of choice early in the game.
The characters in this game are truly memorable, I remember every character in this game because of the superb acting skills, and some of them even grow on you, Yes Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves) does grow on you too but he's just your typical breathtaking guy who acts the same every movie but in this game, he does a well-done job playing a washed in rocker. The true heroes are Panam, Judy, Rivers, and your main character V. The love interest in this game is very lacking though

☀World☁
The world design is beautiful, Although the architecture of the city is amazing the world itself is smut filled a little too overwhelming at times but regardless it is a very large and beautiful place to explore.There are very deep lore to this game but it requires players to actually read to understand the world itself. Most of the quests in the game are your basic run of the mill you'll find in many games. You got your main quest and your copy and paste quest and larger important sidequests that chains which are the meaty quests in the game. The only problem missing from this game is the variety of quest types you can find. No other mini-games can be found surprisingly like Gwent, photo shooting or collectibles. Even the bars around the map felt empty when explored as they do not offer much and absolutely felt pointless visiting.

♚Gameplay♛
The gameplay is basic loot and shooter with a dynamic on how you play. You can use guns, melee, hack, or stealth enemies your choice on how you want to do it. The only downside is that the skill tree felt rushed and certain skills are broken or need fine-tuning and changes. Some of the benefits from the tree could be seen only benefits cut content. Some skills on the tree felt completely useless and needs rework. 

✎Graphics✐
You cannot argue that with the right card the graphics in this game is amazing, Even running at a 1080gtx oc in max settings I was able to see the game in 4k without ray tracing and it looked great. Will be looking at a 3080 once they come back to boost it so I can see every other eye candy. The animations from characters in this game are so on point and detailed that you will freak out when you look characters in the eyes and feel the emotions.

♫Sound&Music♬
There is a certain area of the game that confuses me at this point or bugs? I don't know sometimes the audio cuts out, sometimes character sounds like they are right up to my ear or sometimes there is no sound at all. But the best winner in this category is the music in this game. The music is banging from the radio stations to in-game music all memorable. The queue at the right time and fit the game perfectly, Noone can forget twirling your pistol as you reload it to the Cello music of Johnny Silverhand.

⌚Afterthoughts⌚
In short, this was a game came out too raw instead of fully baked requiring at least a few more months. Too many bugs, optimization issues, and glaring bad AI problems all around. The game could have been a potential masterpiece here. It is a damn shame that it went through all this debacle and at the same time I have seen games like this many many times where they underdeliver on overpromises and people burn on the hype train. This game was way too hyped for its good and got the full brunt from gamers especially since this is what? CDPR 4th open-world game. Many wasted potential and possibilities. From a prestigious company like this to see them in this state is sad since trust is a very hard thing to gain from players and will take a long time to regain but the recovery is a possibility, only time will tell at this point and by that point, if players will be willing to return, it will have to be drastic changes to fix it up.
I will change my Thumbs down to a thumbs up  recommendation once this is accomplished in the following months which I will be waiting to see.

Even though the game has bugs it still is really fun to play."

1610102090,"Definately worth playing on PC!

Good:
Main story and side quests
Many ways to play that are fun. Gun, sneak, hack.
Voice acting
Raytracing looks nice
First person immersion is nice in conversations.

Bad:
World is filled with people but feels empty.
Some glitches, but overall works good on high end PC.
Witcher 3 is still a better game, choices matter more, more feeling, better music, better atmosphere. (CP2077 is not far behind though)
Needs more 3rd person cut scenes"
1610112444,!!! THIS GAME IS FUCKING ATROCIOUS !!!
1610101753,This is the best single player game I have ever tried
1610101646,"This is an excellent game with plenty of replay value, and will only get better over time."
1610101567,my sweat panam...
1610101016,"[h1]Version 1.06[/h1]
I cannot recommend this game in this state. Too many bugs and glitches. Some glitches ruined the immersion in story missions for me. The police spawning instantly behind you after a crime is a joke. Police pursuit system is almost non-existent.

The menu screen and all it's sub-systems (inventory, crafting, character build trees etc.) feel like a place holder beta build version. Story and side missions for the most part are dull. The dialogue is mostly boring drivel and uninspired. There were some good moments in the main story but not many.

Nothing fun to do in the often times beautiful Night City. Boring. Soulless City. Combat was nothing special. Quickhacking was like a visually dull magic system. Breach Protocol wasn't fun to use and pulled you out of the action during combat.

Music was pretty good.

When the game is truly finished and all the DLC drops I'll give it another chance.

Disappointing game from the developers of one of my favorites 'The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt'."
1610100942,"buggy at time's but the game is fun and not to hard to get into
"
1610100851,"Great story
Gun play is fun with room to get better
I personally experienced no game breaking bugs and very few visual glitches. 
Played the entire thing in 4k and it looks stunning

i Look forward to where they take the game and im sure they will build on the small things like npc ai's and balancing out certain builds to not be so strong."
1610100824,"This is not the game CDPR promised us. it's not even close to it. 

Almost everything they told about the game was cut or lied about. there is no AI in this game, everything is scripted. It was supposed to be the most advanced and believable AI ever created with day and night cycles. This is simply not true, NPC's walk in circles and can be found doing the same thing day and night. Traffic is a disaster, there is a reason you never see parked cars or parking lots (besides the cars that you can buy) because if there is no AI they simply wont park or enter cars and drive away.
There are multiple video's about this on the internet already. check it out.

This game was marketed as one of the biggest open world RPG's and that was also NOT true, they changed the Genre to Action Adventure, without even notifying people about it.

The open world feels great at first, but after a while the cracks start to become visible. 
There is nothing to do in this game besides doing the main quests (that Is easy finishable in less than 15 hours) and some side quests. besides that everything is repeatable. The story is mediocre and the romances feel awkward. 

Once you create a character you are stuck with it, there are no ways to change your appearance. Besides the weird clothing/armor system that looks like crap. This is very weird because this game world is supposed to be about changing you appearance and cybernetics. 

The Police system is bad. Even the police in GTA3 is 100 times better. It's so bad that if you are on a rooftop and you shoot someone 500meters away, the police will instantly spawn behind you.

Cars disappear infront of you and crowds disappear when you look away.

Even though you have the option to turn nudity on or off, the entire game is censored. 

Also if you have epilepsy do NOT play this game. Their are many times this game flashed lights in your face.

1610100730,Preem
1610100376,"Good game over all if you have the PC to handle it. I ran on a 2070 just fine with Med/High settings. Treated this much more like a Skyrim instead of a ""Genre Defining"" RPG title and really enjoyed it. My ending wasn't mind blowing, but still left me satisfied. 
Worth my 49 hours to beat it the first time doing most side missions and gigs. I will revisit it later on with better hardware and once they release more content for sure."
1610100304,"A disappointment, only a few scripted events emersed me into the Cyberpunk setting, while the failed open world would jank me out of it.
They made many promises of which very few were kept, they only give the only illusion of choice and consequences.
Driving and racing is garbage, games from the early 1990's have better driving mechanics/AI.
MAX-TAC Cops drop nothing, cops in general just suddenly teleport in when V commits a crime."
1610100239,"they have alot of glitches and its making me crazy but still worth playing

1610100221,"Is good, very good. nice immersive world."
1610100190,"Game is a borderline unplayable quasi-rpg shit.
Ads were just a scam, totally untrue and made players believe its an actually good game lol"
1610100089,"Liked the graphics, city atmoshphere, story, music, details in environment, easter eggs, quests
Disliked the police AI, lack of vehicle customisation, lack of transmogs, NPC blandness.

But in general I very much enjoyed the game. Bugs but no crashes

(only 46 hours played via steam as I accessed the game file directly from Explorer so many more hours in reality)"
1610099971,good
1610099750,"Night city is huge, just not yet ready for players. 
Not returning the game since I like the idea of Cyberpunk, and I trust CDPR will give me a complete Night city eventually. But for now, do not buy."
1610099625,"The Good:
Good Main story 
Good Characters
Fun game play.

The Bad
Some bugs. (no show stoppers)
Not the best shooter 
Not the best driving simulator

Conclusion:
Its a CDProject game.
Want immersive world with fun story and side quests , this will not disapoint
want an open living world with horse that shit , go for gtaV or rdr2 , that aint it .

but its good on what it does , but its not the perfect game.

Game run nicely on my 1070 2k resolution , but i am on high and Don't have all the ray tracing stuff."

1610097919,"Although the game has its bugs, the game is amazing in every aspect.  The lore and knowledge of Cyberpunk 2020 that has been put into this game is amazing and a great stroll down memory lane.  The characters that you interact with were legends in the tabletop game from so many years ago.  It is awesome to see them in physical form (albeit digitally).  The game itself is rather fun to play.  It gives you a feeling of an rpg version of grand theft auto, and a gta version of an rpg.  The more you immerse yourself into the game the more Night City comes to life.  I cant wait for them to release more content and story."
1610097859,Rogue looks fucking sweet
1610097857,72+ patches away from being the great game that they said it was going to be. But personally my favorite!
1610097672,"A great game but lacks choice consequence. The game is riddled with bugs as of the moment and is demanding on your PC
( Although this shouldn't be a problem if you have good specs ). The perks system is lackluster and a lot of the things promised by CD Projekt Red is not there in game and doesn't feel complete. Despite these problems, I had a fairly good time but some things could have been better and experiences may differ which is evident as of the mass controversy over this game at the moment."
1610097532,"Great game in terms of graphics, worldbuilding, characters and storyline. Gameplay is rarely innovative, basically deus ex/dishonored with extended gunplay. Does it live up to the hype? Well, kinda. I think the biggest mistake of CDPR was to tease a lot of preliminary content/mechanics that did not end up in the final game, thus leaving many people disappointed. Hopefully the upcoming patches will polish everything up a bit. It's still a great game nevertheless! Performance is surprisingly good on medium raytracing settings (RTX 2070S, Ryzen 2600X). Didn't experience gamebreaking bugs, mostly some objects glitching through stuff, stuck items in cutscenes etc. One very annoying audio bug where the same 10 second sample would endlessly repeat until i reloaded the game, but this happened only once so far. Can already recommend the game for the story as you can easily sink 60+ hours into it without doing a lot of generic fetch/kill/drive quests. If you're unsure, wait till the patches in january/february roll out."

1610095873,"One of the best games I've ever played. Amazing graphics (but first you have to own a good graphics card), antisystem-revolutionary-social-killer-ghost in a shell-Altered Carbon story. I also like the original RPG system Cyberpunk 2077, Cyberwere is a very nice RPG feature. You can die fast if you're not careful even at level 50, it's not like DND, where level 20 kills with no efford  Orc level 1. The game still has bugs, for example the police system is quite unfinished, there is also no business logic, why sold and bought by the same staff for the same price? Different weapons have the same ammunition, but they are not that serious. I couldn't complete a few tasks with Cyberpsycho. I haven't finished the game yet, so the content is like 90 hours if you try to play all the side quests. I'm waiting for the debug and also for the new DLC. You should buy it, I think this open world game will change the gameplay as we know it.."
1610095870,"Honestly I enjoyed Cyberpunk 2077 a lot, But I do have 2 problems with the game; some of cars drive like Mario at an Ice Rink and those Beat on the Brat side missions are one of the most frustrating things I've played.
I give it a 2020/2077

1610095605,"While there are a ton of bugs on launch, the game itself is great, either I've been lucky or the bugs seem minor for the most part or ""fixable"" in some cases by just re-loading an older save. Honestly reminds me of playing older games like kotor with the constant safety saving, but it's a pretty minor complaint for a game I've already gotten my moneys worth of entertainment from."

1610094637,"Loads of bugs & glitches, but what can you expect? Such a kickass experience."
1610094526,"This game has been getting a lot of shit for its bugs and poor handling of reviews but in my opinion, none of it is a deal breaker. The world, story, and characters are so breath-taking and engaging that I was personally able to look past the issues I had with it. Don't expect this game to change your life but it could very well raise the bar for story-telling in video games."
1610094477,"The game will only get better with time, and the world is very immersive. Any build is viable, there are a lot of combat options, combat is fluid and fun. The glitches for me are funny and I am like pretty sure all the major stuff will get fixed and I am really looking forward to all of the mods that will be created to make this game exactly how you want it."
1610094451,"Great story line and definitely had me at the seat of my chair towards the end. I will say that I hope that there comes an expansion pack where it continues the story I created with the Aldecados. Wish there was more business ventures in the Corpo. I do hope that running your own little business and buying homes is a thing. All in all, I definitely enjoyed this game."
1610094301,"Storytelling is very well done in this game. And I like the amount of replayability options this game gives you (gender, voice lines, decisions) lead to a slightly different ending. Excited to see where this game goes with their planned improvements & dlcs."

4. One of the worst AI ever. (not gonna be fixed)
5. flawed looting system (this may be fixed pretty soon) 

My personal issues with this game 
1. The campaign was too short for me 
2. The choices you make throughout the game and at the end only impact you (and ur friends depending on ur previous choice) but the world around you mostly is unaffected. In contrast Geralt from witcher 3 impacts the whole world around him after the final campaign."
1610092721,"[h1] Cyberpunk 2077 is my Top Game of 2020 [/h1]

I have fully completed the game, all side missions, crime reports, bought all cars, completed every ending utilizing a reflex and strength build with crafting maxed. As a result I hit 100% practically and got every single achievement which allows me to feel like I can share my opinion of Cyberpunk 2077. We were all hyped for this game and we were all excited and incredibly disappointed by the cut content, constant bugs and annoyances. This game runs awfully too. Using a I5-9600K, an RTX 2080, and 16 GB of Ram I practically averaged 30 FPS with RTX and Max settings. Sometimes it dipped lower and needed resets. When the game did run at 60 FPS though it looked so smooth and always looked beautiful. I want to preface by simply saying I blame the heads of CDPR, but it is undeniable that the developers put love into this game. Keanu Reeves has amazing moments as Johnny and the characters are all lovable and make you genuinely care for the story and their conflicts that you are intertwined in.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

It seems like a lot of RPG games are moving to the looter/shooter action roleplay categories like Fallout 4. It isn't bad but creates a gameplay loop of exploration, kill, collect items and rinse and repeat. This is broken up constantly in this game with just plain good storytelling and writing. Some things are much too over explained and can just be put on shards which are the equivalent of journals in this game, but in other cases they do it well enough to let you figure out how the world works. Crafting is pretty basic ranging from white/common to orange/legendary materials which you need sufficient amounts to craft items which items can be modified with modifiers and upgrading. My major gripe is that Unique weapons can't be locked so you may accidentally scrap quite a few and you need the old one to upgrade them to the next rarity. Some unique items are tagged to quests and aren't deleted which is great except they then get stuck in your inventory taking up weight with no way to remove them or drop them i.e. [spoiler] Johnny's Clothing, Crash (The weapon given by River) and a few others [/spoiler]. 
Now the main draw is modifying your body which is locked behind some stat requirements for the better quality ones. Equipping mantis blades in a reflex build was the most fun I had. I think the monowire is a little under powered but maybe I was just using it wrong who knows. Didn't play with the other weapons too much but smart link for smart weapons was fun, equipping a double jump and various other effects like simple stat increases are all done through cybermods/cyberwear and it is up to you to explore them.
Collectibles: I am so glad that collectibles aren't tied to achievements and the only main one is find all the fast travel points and the tarot cards which are on your map so they aren't just arbitrarily hidden. I am glad open world games are moving away from hidden collectibles that take way too long to find all of them and even tell from guides which ones you already have. I hope all future games follow what Cyberpunk does.

[h1] The Writing [/h1]

This game is full of moments that are so well written that I was blown away. Some side missions dealt with the dystopia setting, but it was incredible seeing how relatable to our current day and age some of the topics were like how we treat our Veterans that are thrown to the streets, rampant drug use and even darker topics like suicide and depression as well as media influence and the 1% that rule the rest of the population. I will admit though that the way they introduce your first companion who you spend the first act with and supposedly build a backstory together is not done to well, but he does become a very likeable character as well as Takemura who you will meet later in the story. The depth and story involved with some characters is amazing and I thoroughly enjoyed it. 

The romanceable characters are also pretty well written although it seems like the fan favorites are Judy and Panam which is understandable. Luckily you can complete all of the character stories and their final missions without romancing them and can simply have your favorite for romance which plays a big part in the endings.

[h1] The Cons/The Bugs [/h1]
[list]
    [*]Once spawned my car in and it flew in from the sky and could then drive through every other car and had no collision
    [*]Crowds of people would just disappear. Once was walking to a plaza that was filled with people and got hit by a car and when I got up that very plaza was empty. Similarly I was fighting a lot of cops and then they suddenly all despawned
    [*]The visual glitching was stuck and required me to reset my game
    [*]The racing has really bad rubberbanding on enemy driver's parts and you can literally watch them spawn in behind you when you get too far
    [*]Ragdolls bug out
    [*]Sometimes you can just clip into object and I don't mean the popular vending machine one where you get stuck in one permanently I mean random things like boxes on roofs
    [*]Side Quests that require you to wait and ""do other things to wait for a call or text"" sometimes just don't work at all and require you to sometimes load a previous save or just keep trying and resetting your game. In particular I triggered the No return save and was using that and it broke a lot of those side quests
    [*]Quest scenes will just break randomly causing people involve din the conversation to just be talking from across the room and not in their proper place
    [*]Sometimes quest bodies can just be stuck in the ground in particular ones that are needed to finish the quest
    [*]Some scenes don't activate properly like the Cyberpsycho that needed you to examine everything in the ritual
    [*]The A.I. is laughably bad in most cases
    [*]Some side quests are arbitrary and confusing in what they want like if by no noise it means don't kill or don't even knock enemies out
    [*]Putting knocked enemies out in containers to hide their bodies count them as killed

[h1] The Endings: SPOILER ALERT [/h1]

Starting this I just want to say that the story is short and the amount of hours CDPR said it would take is not nearly as much as they estimated. I was surprised that the majority of my time was going from the bottom of the map and up completing all the side missions and hit 50 (The Max Level) and 50 Street Cred Level well before Act 2 was complete. 
[spoiler] I felt like I needed to talk about some of the endings. The suicide ending in particular was amazing and portrayed so well. The after credit videos of all your friends and loved ones telling you how angry they were hearing you had killed yourself and it was a shocker. This is part of the reason why I think some of the character writing is the best I have ever seen. The Arasaka ending had interesting choices and endings, but it really wasn't that good in my opinion unless you enjoy roleplaying a Corpo or really like Takemura because the other endings make him hate your guts if you save his life after the attack on Hanako. Finally, the secret ending would be the best but due to it having just the normal stay in night city as a legend or give Johnny your body ending it's the best if you don't want to watch your loved ones die for your cause. Also, the secret ending really depends on how well you treat Johnny and really isn't explained too well pretty much requiring you to use a guide and most guides are wrong on the exact responses you need to get more relationship % with Johnny. Finally, my favorite is the Panam ending because I am a sucker for the romantic ending and it gives you the most hope for your character like V has a chance to find a way to save himself in the end.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
Had a lot of fun and this game ate up my life for a good month."
1610092510,bought because of the hype and kept seeing it being delayed to finish the game but they release it and its like still in beta game looks polished in some cases and others looks like a game from 2014 with random things not rendering in or people straight up walking through solid objects like why waste your money on this
1610091581,"I am forced to issue a negative review because since December 24th I cannot continue the main story of the game and the patch has not yet been issued.

In one of the main missions you are supposed to answer a call from the contractor. He never calls, you cannot call him, therefore - the story mission cannot continue beyond this point.

I cannot rollback my save, because before I realized the main quest is bugged I played around 20 hours of content and I just don't want to roll back because of something that isn't my fault.

It's not the only bug related to phone calls. Currently I have several unresolved side quests because of call bugs - the contractor is supposed to call to you and inform you about completing the gig. When you miss one phone call from a contractor, all further side gigs will be bugged.

CDPR has acknowledged the issue in the e-mail for me, but they haven't patched that since.

I guess they are working now to fix the mess that is PS4 release of the game.

So far it means I cannot continue playing the game, and feel forced to post a negative review for game breaking bugs."
1610091387,I like it. GO FOR IT
1610091350,"Awesome game. Very immersive world and great story telling. Not all the side missions seem the same like in lots of games. I like the weapons and upgrades. I fell into playing as a knife wielding maniac most of the time or being stealthy. 

My only issues are that there a bugs every now and then. I recommend saving frequently and having a few different saves going so you can reload an older one if something weird happens. 

The control layout for the menu was a bit weird at first, and there are a few things that are hard to find but generally I figured things out."
1610091111,"Honestly, this game is great. If you've got a good pc and can run it on max graphics and like an engaging story, you'll probably be able to appreciate it in some way or another. I bought it on day one and had no game breaking bugs and very little broken immersion. Would recommend if you like games making you feel uneasy inside."
1610091070,"Hmm i don't have a lot to add to what's already been said in multiple places. The game itself is just ok, it isn't the game to end all games it was hyped up to be, it isn't Game of the Year or even RPG of the Year. Its an ok first person RPG with a cyberpunk skin... I still think its worth the cost of entry and would recommend it, however... The bugs are absolutely insane. Make no mistake the bugs are many and rampant- Falling through the world, teleworking npcs including police, quests not triggering, escort npcs not moving, stats not resolving as expected, honestly, i could go on and on and on and on and on.

Im told they will fix these and if i hear they have i will switch this to a recommend but even then, it's a 7 or 8 out of 10 for me. I would say i have gotten my moneys worth from the game... I would also say i have just as many hours played in games that cost literally 1/4 the price of this game so what do i know lol."
1610090966,peerty good
1610090859,"Nope the f**k out of this one, hopefully they No Man Sky it and fix the s**t out of it.  I would say 1/3 of my 126 hours played is lost time due to game breaking bugs.  My Street Kid play through that damn cab quest bugged, now no fixers call to confirm missions completed so I get zero god d**n XP and money.  I had to reload a save from 15 back to f**king level 5 because of that bug.  Eat my a** CDPR, I should have bought a box of Space Marines and painted them over this garbage."
1610090670,story good 7.5/10
1610090293,Fun game despite the controversy
1610090546,"Despite a rocky launch, this game has a lot to offer. Despite frequent minor bugs and a few major, the engaging story and amazing world makes up for it. Despite some linearity, the writing drags you in.

i should note that I didn't go into this game with much expectations. Nor did I follow its development super closely. Besides the initial 2013 trailer and the trailer closer to launch, I knew nothing about what the game was promoting. So, this review is not based on the hype surrounding the game nor of CDPR fangasming, given that I didn't particularly like any other CDPR game. This is me, going in mostly blind, and coming out relatively highly satisfied.

The good:
-Spectacular writing, spectacular characters, and a compelling story. Absolutely spectacular. Rarely is there a game with such character depth. Even some side quests are more engaging than the entire story of some comparable games. So many characters in this game I quickly felt attached too.
-A detailed and entrapping world. It really does feel alive and lived in, and really grounded in its own reality. There's so much to explore.
-Combat is good and fluid. Initially I was worried that combat would be clunky, and sometimes the gunplay is less organic than in, say, Fallout 4, but overall it's satisfying.
-Animations are top notch. Seriously, probably the most organic character animations I've seen in a game. From minor facial expression changes to simple actions. Everything looks mocapped, even when it's not.

The bad:
-Linearity. Except for one major branching path towards the end of the game, literally noting you do effects the end of the game. New Vegas this isn't.
-Minimal roleplaying. For and RPG most of the RP elements are entirely based on combat style and aptitudes. Quickhacking vs Melee vs Guns. While cyberwear adds an interesting option to most play styles, there is little in the way of actually living in the awesome world CDPR has made. No tats, no haircuts, no busy work, no establishing yourself, no changing your characters morals, lifepath, etc. No benefit to engaging with vendors, or interactions with different factions. It would be nice to actually live in the world.
-Half of the world isn't even exploited. Through both main story missions and major side missions, there are some areas on the map I have never been to. Some gangs I've only encountered a few times. Some places I've only seen once. They created all these factions and cool areas but give you no reason to engage with them. You can go out of your way to explore these areas, but they have no impact on the story.

The ugly:
-Bugs. Bugs bugs bugs. Minor bugs, mostly. Every time I mounted my motorbike I'm momentarily bald until my headwear loads in. Frequently what a character is holding floats in place after they move their hand. Characters consistently phase through doors that aren't open. At times, it's problematic and really distracting, especially during important moments in the story. Rarely audio loops. Sometimes floating speech bubbles. A perpetually uncompleteable side mission because a car I need to interact with spawned under the map. For being such a great experience these things rip you out of the world and constantly remind you that yes, this is software.
-The meta element. The game was made under poor conditions nearing the end and should have been delayed an addition year for polish and additional elements, and to prevent crunch and poor working standards. CDPR workers, consider a union.
-There is, effectively, no replayability. Because the linearity of the story, and that all divergences can be made basically in the final mission of the game, there is no reason to replay from the beginning. Sure, you can romance someone else and pick a different ending, but that's kind of it."
1610090170,The Game Crashes when i get shot by dexter 1/10
1610090117,"Buggy, but its a fun game. Great soundtrack."
1610090024,"GOD DAMN. CD PR has done it again! releasing a  new game that is. A new FPS IP, the games visuals is ""breath taking"" as Keanu Reaves would put it, if and only if you have an RTX 3090. Even with Nvidias 30 series cant even handle to perform in ultra rtx setting. The game's gameplay is half-baked and the story is comparably to an edgy ""Blade Runner"" fan fic story. The world is dense, populated, gorgeos, but with half-baked or non-existent life in it. the character are well thought out, yet the narrative story is unclear and is a mess. screen writers should have made more relatable and likeable characters instead, rather putting a band of edgy annoying and needy ones. what i mean by this is that literally everyone needs your help even though your leg is half in the grave with johnny in it as well.

this game is an openworld borderland game with a different title, visible genitalia and clothing

will revise the good and bad later"
1610089843,"It's more than just bugs that drag this game down. The game is a shell of what it should/could have been. You can see evidence of scrapped features everywhere you go if you look for them. It's most obvious in certain areas such as the skill based dialogue choices that never impact quest outcomes, to the the NPC reactions to gunfire, BD ""junk items"" that state you can't play them with no story reason why, and all elevators leading to just two floors. That's all before you get to the unintentional bugs. Everything about the game screams rushed.

That being said, the game does a few things right. The graphics and facial animation are solid, the atmosphere is MOSTLY what it needs to be, and killing things is actually fun.

It's probably worth $60 dollars but don't expect Witcher 3, GTA 5, or Red Dead 2. If you want open world polished gameplay, go play those. If you're on the fence but haven't played the modern Deux Ex franchise, I'd likely recommend those over this as well. 7/10"
1610089578,"The game is generally fine, some bugs need to be fixed and fighting needs big changes, because many times the game can't keep up with the fast pace of fighting, which is sometimes very annoying this is my opinion."
1610089465,"Disregarding all the bugs, this game has an interesting and engaging main story line, with hundreds of even more interesting, fun and exciting side missions. The graphics are good (even though I did expect them to be even better than they are from all that I heard about them during its development). For me there is little to complain about, I have experience several bugs but only one of which was game breaking but i fixed it with a little bit of trial and error.

My opinion is that if you have the game and can play it then play it, don't refund it. It is fun and very enjoyable. The bugs will be fixed its just a matter of waiting. But if you do not have the game yet, don't buy it . Wait 6 months (mid 2021) and buy it then. It will be much better than is now, most likely with performance increases and less bugs."
1610089464,"First i ask you read all the way to the end to understand my rating, thank you.

To talk about the game itself first. Its honestly one of the best games ive ever played. The story characters and setting are all utterly fantastic.  Its combat is really fun once you get your head around it, and the depth of story content and path quests reminds me of the origonal deus ex. It consatnly had me feeling for the characters whatever situation we found ourselves in. and it gives you a wide option of how to appraoch missions while making sure unless your invested in whatever your doing youll be really bad at it. Making it truly feel like your character develops and feels diffrent whatever path you chose.

I could gush for hours about this game, but how we reach the great big fat HOWEVER that givs this review its negative rating. 

I cannot condone how the execs at CDPR treated the staff and this game and its customers. Lying for years about how they wherent using crunch, the state of developemtn of the game, and using unrepresentative footage right up until launch while pushing out a console version thats bascily unplayable? its something i cannot ignore and i refuse to elt my love of this game be used for positive covrage for the execs to hide behind. This game is truly something special but until the game is fixed and the execs at CDPR start to make it up to the devs who worked so hard on this i cannot give it anything other then a negative rating."
1610089296,On a powerful PC its a very deep experience with a lot of side quests and options.
1610088967,"start out this as i enjoyed the game as a linear story, but to portray this game as a next gen open world RPG is a joke. The AI is a joke and the consistent bugs that ruin the game and kill the immersion is so overwhelming. The game was meant to be so much more and hopefully in the future they can fix the issues and add all the cut content that they promised but im not holding my breath for it. there is better open world RPGs out there with better game mechanics and smarter AI then this stinker of a title. Now they are talking of rolling out a DLC??? who in their right minds as a dev think that is a good move? fix the bugs and give us the cut content that was meant to be in the game. We trusted you to save us from the hell that was 2020 and you just added to the fire and laughed as you shoveled the cash into your to-go bags and said nah we ain't gonna do a overhaul on the game and bring back cut content. we have been bamboozled folks and i hope people can look past Panam's ass and see that this game is a nightmare that wasn't meant to be released for another year or 2. game started with 1 million concurrent on steam in December now the numbers are 80k in less then a month. Sony doesn't even support the game through their store. What does that say about the direction this is going? downhill and faster then the world anticipated. i wanna love the game, but i had to literally will myself to finish the game and yet here i am still pissed there is no new game+ yet or even a road map to help instill some trust with the community. CDPR i loved the witcher 3, but you fucked the pooch on this one and i can't back this game or recommend it to anyone that i care about."
1610094647,"It's fun, but this is a *Cyberpunk* game with no character customization after the intro.
:/


Things I like: 
-Great combat
-Good story
-Keanu Reeves likeness as Johnny Silverhand
-Best grenades in video games

Grievances:
-Crafting. In Cyberpunk.
-No gun/apparel/car customization
-Crafting system
-Universal Ammo Types
-Open world is dead
-The speedo I found had better armor than my composite vest
-Crafting system
-I can't shoot this gun, I'm too low a level
-Dialogue options don't always line up with what V actually says
-Police spawn out of thin air
-Civilians apparate away is you look away from them
-No character customization after creation. In cyberpunk
-Crafting system
-No different apartments or abodes
-No customizing the one apartment you have
-wtf are the smart guns why are the bullets going every other direction its a gun not a beehive

Stay tuned, I'll think of more

This game is alot of fun, but it leans too heavily into being a dime-a-dozen RPG as opposed to mixing in immersive sim elements and the gameplay mostly disregards the setting. Having a crafting system over customization makes no sense for the cyberpunk setting, the whole idea is that the corpo's control everything, means of production included. I could get crafting if we actually had to use crafting stations for things like weapon mods and drugs, but no apparently V has a lathe and mill in their thighs. My favorite example would be the augmentation in general. For one, you need certain body stat requirements to augment. Isn't the whole point of augmentation to overcome our bodies shortcomings? And those cool arm mods like the Mantis blades, monowire or gorilla fists? They're just different melee weapons with no utility. No wall climbing with mantis blades, gorilla fists don't add to your strength, no utility at all. This means that all three pale in comparison to the infinite ammo arm mounted rocket launcher. Speaking of, Keanu Reeves appearance in this game is appropriate, since the combat + the music makes you feel like john wick. Those grenades are  g l o r i o u s . i had like 58 after the tutorial for some reason so they became my main weapon.
Little to no interactivity or dynamics with the open world, one of the massive selling points of the game and one that likely came with many compromises during development. STALKER: Anomaly's open world is far more dynamic than this one. In Anomaly's Exclusion Zone, just going from point A to B for a generic quest becomes a story into and of itself. Example: I got hired to recover some documents from an abandoned research facility across the zone. I stocked up on food and ammo, and set out. I snuck through enemy territory, narrowly missing a pack of mutant boars and other stalkers, but ultimately got to Yantar, the region in which the facility was located. I came to a small checkpoint, narrowly diving to cover as several hostile stalkers lept from their camp and opened fire on me. I was forced to retreat, realizing I'd need a disguise to get past their numbers. While on my way back to base, I was ambushed by stalkers from an enemy faction. I managed to drop one of them, and the others retreated. I snagged his suit from him, netting me a disguise, along with his guns and other valuables. I was still low on supplies, so I set out back for home. Then I heard the sirens. A massive wave of radiation was about to flood the area, and with all the guys stuff, I could hardly sprint. I had seconds, and decided to charge back to my base and hopefully escape. I barely manage to scramble to the level transition as the radiation wave hits, and I survive. When I made it back to friendly territory, it was night, I was exhausted and dehydrated. I'd hardly taken 3 steps before I was ambushed and gored by several wild boars. Such is life in the Zone. That's just one story, I've gotten plenty more just by playing the game.
In Cyberpunk's Night City, you go from point A to B, maybe getting a phone call from a talking taxi now and again. You never get interesting stories from Night City because it's all a facade, not a living world.

It's a generic RPG with no focus on immersion with a mile wide, meter deep open world. Good grenades, characters and overall story I think (so far, I'm waiting for the game to be fixed before I finish it)."
1610088821,fun game hacker shoot a man
1610088788,eh
1610088391,s'pretty fun
1610088334,its awesome but it was released to early and the game didn't run as smoothly as it could've if it had more time to be fully finished. It would've been way better if they only waited
1610088307,"Second playthrough over, I'm gunna table it till a later update hits. It will only get better. I thoroughly enjoyed it but in its current state I would tell you to wait...100%. You should buy this product IF they can finish it. 

Currently it's a solid 7.5/10 as is...it has 10/10 potential...ESPECIALLY after the DLCs if they can over-deliver in the same way the Witcher's did to compensate for what feels like some missing core features. 

Tips: Don't 100% the game, do the core story, do the side mission with the lover you want, shoot for an ending you think fits your character, and finish it. Reroll a new character. Game just works better if you aren't trying to grind it out. Act 1 was replayable enough on the second round to not be too much of an issue, give yourself new stuff to do on your second go to make it feel unique. Don't try to get everything you want the first time...just go with your gut. 

The game feels built more to be replayed in bursts...not 100%'d. This ain't the Witcher 3...at least, not totally. 

Pros: 
- Best map in gaming...period.

- Solid gameplay, lots of gameplay choices, Cyberware can feel super impactful...or entirely pointless, same for perks...so it's a mixed bag....It DEFINITELY needs balancing to keep it challenging. Give it a gameplay balance so it stays difficult and cut out all the ways you can become a god and it's much more enjoyable than comparable franchises like GTA or Fallout. I felt I needed to intentionally avoid becoming overpowered or I'd undermine the experience. But the power fantasy is pretty neat for a bit.  

- Level Design has great verticality and feels refreshing. It also rewards you paying attention, and any game that lets you parkour to experience new ways to play the same area is winning. 

- The story is top tier and I think every character feels fully fleshed out and the voice actors killed it 10/10 for both playthroughs. A total treat, it balances agency with an understanding of the genre really well...Cyberpunk isn't a power fantasy, the world is supposed to beat you down. While it lacks in choice, the story is rarely if ever bad because of that...whereas I find games like Fallout sacrifice story quality entirely just to let you do things...which is kind of pointless. So I'm mixed on this, especially given the Tabletop origins, I do have gripes with their choices. 

- Loved the music, the soundtrack, the radio, the sound design is dope. 

I have a long list of cons but they aren't THAT important in the grand scheme of things. Some more than others. 

Cons: 

- Glitched (like, pretty damn gnarly),,.I'd wait if you can. Your game experience will improve exponentially if you do. 1070ti experience was solid, but still...IF you can wait...I 100% suggest it. I think this game just needs you to feel immersed to deliver the setting and while I got that enough...what I would give to be in the future and get another playthrough and really dive in again with it working perfectly. 

- Choice really isn't that prevalent and that is something you'd expect from a franchise built from a Tabletop...the choices are meaningful when they give you them (outside of just chat options that function more as backstory)...and the 3 core endings (with variants) are super fuckin good...just again, the biproduct of trying to be so narratively tight. 

- Needs a bit more meaningful side content. The core relationships and a few other plots were great...but it needs a few more missions like the one with Meredith Stout to feel like a real choice based experienced. Especially after Act 1. 

- Driving, specifically collision...needs work. Some cars are great, others...not at all. 

- Needs a lot of QoL improvements. Zoomable minimap, 3D model'd character shadows, etc. 

- Very little immersion, like for a world this incredible and detailed...it feels like set dressing, they give you few ways to interact and be a part of it outside of a mission, which again...this is a game based on a tabletop...that feels like a missed box. You can dance at like 2 clubs, food is in a menu...and while IN THE MAIN STORY...it makes you feel immersed, outside of that space you have few ways to interact. 

It really would only take a few of the items you can eat in the story accessible at a stall, and 1-3 drinks at a bar I can sip on and not just giving me a menu. Letting me dance ANYWHERE....you'd have a fully immersive space top tier immersive game. 

- Some further interactions with our ""relationships"" nothing big, but even just some convo's we can have physically. 

--------------------------------------

End of the day...

What most excites me about the game is still the franchise itself. I REALLY hope they stick this out and commit to the franchise. They clearly couldn't deliver what they wanted, but I hope they keep at it. They really have something special here and as a first entry I am really impressed and would give them my money again in a heartbeat to get more of Night City.

I just wish they'd focus a bit less on backstory and setpieces, and more on letting me tell my story, as well as incorporating multiplayer. Immersive systems, making a space in Night City, etc. 

Imo, the tabletop format works best in a multiplayer setting...so in general, I think this title would just work so much better if they re-purposed this game for a multiplayer space. I'd much rather explore this space with friends than anything else on offer...it just needs to be compelling and allow for group dynamics and sandbox fun making like you'd get out of a tabletop. 

As a tabletop adaptation, I find this game misses the mark. As a step moving from Witcher 3, I think it is still a step forward and I'm glad to see them have the balls to take on a far more complex universe. Even if it clearly didn't go as planned, it was still worth the effort and was still one of the better games I've ever played. I hope they keep at it and keep moving forward. They went from the Witcher to a Rockstar competitor, and that's a lot...I hope they can get better business management so they can retain the talent they will need to actually deliver at a Rockstar level.

1610087975,"Game is really not that impressive. Extremely over hyped. Graphically it is really good but far from the best. Story i really couldn't care for, and the gameplay was just a chore. I put about 6 hours into it when I realized that I could put that time into a game that was actually fun to play on it's own merit and not because the internet hivemind says so bc of it having keanu reeves in it and being made by the same devs that made the witcher. 
Shazam!"
1610087832,Pretty Good

1610087590,Fun open world game with no RPG elements
1610087491,It is everything I wanted and more. I just want to customize my character's hair mid game but that's about it
1610087365,"Cyberpunk 2077 is underwhelming. The dystopian RPG set in the dark future was promoted to be one of the greatest RPGs of all time with next-gen game elements that would elevate the gameplay and feel super immersive. However, 70+ hours into the game, having finished the main storyline, I was left thinking that even GTA Vice City had greater immersion. Countless YouTube videos are highlighting the glitches, bugs - both game-breaking and hilarious- that outline how deeply empty and not-ready this game is. Disregarding those, even the lifepaths and major gameplay ideas such as the skill tree and character customization, romance options all have something more to be desired. This was not the game that was promised by CDPR. For the first 15 hours of the gameplay, you will hardly recognize these flaws because the game moves at a fun pace and makes you believe in the illusion of choice and randomness that quickly dissipates as you progress through the game. Every ""random"" encounter is obviously scripted and the police system is downright ridiculously broken. Navigating the beautifully crafted world of Night City is an almost impossibility with the terrible driving mechanics, old-gen driving AI that is basically pointless, and if you think walking is a better alternative, you are only reminded of the brain-dead people AI who are no fun to interact with. Cyberpunk 2077 eventually evolves into a game that you need to create your own fun for because not a lot is being generated by the game itself. Also, there's no barber in the game! Perhaps a few years down the line after multiple patches and free DLCs, this game will be worth the buck, but it is currently not worth the time."
1610087230,"The world is huge and well designed.  The game engine is fun and smooth.  The graphics look great on my machine.  The story and lore is extremely well developed.

On the negative side though the game is buggy.  Very buggy.  Insanely buggy.  Also they made a mistake with having missions thrown at you way too intrusively which takes you out of the story.  Like you'd be doing a very important mission and as you're walking to a location you'll get countless phone calls inviting you to new missions."

Oh yeah, skyrim/fallout level bugs, sometimes detrimental. Once had a car crash into the back of me and launch me into space, I flew so far I went over the edge of the map. Story takes maybe 30 hours. Keanu Reeves is literally in this game and for some reason they made [spoiler]Johnny Silverhand[/spoiler] look exactly like him.  Do I recommend it? Yes, it's basically the quality that most games released at $60 price point are. Do I wish there was more? Absolutely yes. This game is good, but Witcher III is better, and I think they know that - there's even Witcher clothing in the game. Buy it if you want to play the beta version of the game before it (hopefully) gets polished up nice and neat. I leave a positive review for now with the stipulation that if I don't see No Man's Sky level changes within 1 year I am going to lay a Jupiter-sized shit of a review on this game. Hey Google - remind me to shit on this game in 1 year if I don't see any changes."
1610086182,games alright i guess
1610086063,Played it for a day kinda fun.
1610085902,This game have a some bugs developers please fix the bugs in the game the graphic are beautiful but there is some bugs in the game i recommend the developers test the game first to fix does bugs in game.
1610085875,10/10
1610085739,"Having a blast with the game, warts and all"
1610085711,"This is a solid entry in the open world RPG genre, with it's greatest strengths being its well-written quests and narratives, memorable characters, and detailed yet organic worldbuilding. Most of the main quest and larger side questlines follow a couple of key characters, and I really felt like I got to know them on a personal level - something that no other game has really done for me.

Certainly, the game has flaws and missed potential - combat/enemy AI is just okay, driving controls are pretty janky, customization options are a little limited (skill tree is mostly pretty boring, also no way to change appearance/haircut in game), etc. I also had my fair share of bugs, but nothing game-breaking and the worst of which could be easily fixed by reloading a save.

Overall, this was one of the most immersive games I've played, and I'd definitely recommend it. While it isn't the groundbreaking RPG that it was hyped up to be, it's still a very solid and enjoyable game. Here's hoping that CDPR will continue to fix bugs, add features, and implement quality-of-life improvements to make it even better."
1610085690,"If you enjoy RPGs for the story and you like the Cyberpunk theme, I think you'll love this game.
CP77 is great at the worldbuilding and atmosphere aspects. The story is failry linear, you mostly have a few different choices of dialogue, but only a few of them have an inpact on the story and they don't really affect the ending. You will be able to unlock every ending in one playthrough. So at some point you'll be able to choose.
The combat and skills are very RPG as in dependant on stats and gear, I find it more enjoyable than I thought it would be though. It really depends on if you enjoy that kind of thing.
The game still has a lot of glitches, some of which can be gamebreaking, so it's up to you if you want to put up with that. I hope CDPR will make sure to get rid of those, because the game is really great besides those little nags.
The hype just created a lot of high expectations and the launch can't live up to them at the moment. It's still a great RPG and I'm in love with the world they brought to life.
Hope you don't let the hate train deter you from looking more into the game and make a more informed decision. Good luck, fellow Samurai. :)"
1610085482,"i liked it, it was fun"
1610085740,"Cyberpunk is a fun game, in my experience i have only encountered minor bugs. And any major bugs can usually be fixed by just restarting the game. The story is interesting but decent the main selling point for the story is the characters and each of their story arcs. Sadly the protagonist is the least fulling character but it may have seemed that way since every character has a good story arc. Combat is a little disappointing, Driving is simple but fun. The main problem for me is when I drive fast in the city I lose frames especially if its raining, but I also have all the settings on high so that may have been the reason for it and to fix it all I did was set crowd density to medium and now I do not lose frames. All in all ITS A GOOD GAME ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE SOMEONE IN YOUR EAR TELLING YOU ITS A BAD GAME."
1610085122,fucking cool
1610084902,"Great game, just need the right specs."
1610084802,"This game is at least a year from being releasable. I do't know who at CDPR decided to ship this, but they should be fired. It has the bones of a Skyrim and the execution of Go-Fish. Morons...."
1610084587,It is as buggy as a trailer queens kitchen however it is really good decent story ive seen worse acting actual gunfighting leaves a bit to be desired but ive never liked hitpoints and bullet spong enemies anyway (headshots should end any fight) PS pretty drunk not spellchecking this
1610084620,"Lets grade this game.
Simple 1-10 scale.

Weapons grade on creative design : 10
Weapons grade on creative mechanics: 10 and a big hell ya.
Weapons grade on actual movement/execution & that good ol FPS fluid motion: 6 


If you don't dig in deep into the crafting system asap then the best parts of the weapon system in this game will just never be realized. I caught on way too late and that sucked but that is what a complex storyline with multiple endings is for I guess. There is time to get back in and try again while the world is actually properly populated with ( action ). 

Storyline grade on character uniqueness and interaction: 10
Storyline grade on overall end of the line feel ( achievement, accomplishment, purpose, depth of meaning, ): 7
Storyline grade on end of game overall cinematic climax kind of stuff :p : 8
Storyline grade on available side quests and the (action therein): 8'ish lol. 
Storyline grade on how the world/world art & npc's add to the actual story experience: 9

I haven't completed all of the possible endings and I haven't tapped into a few of the most interesting possibilities yet. Either way the protagonist ( seems thus far ) to only have control over how your friends and partners perceive you at end game however the actual ending seems to be carved into stone before you even set sail into the story. This is all part of the lore I would imagine and I haven't done much research into  'Neuromancer' by William Gibson yet. I imagine that literary work would clean up a lot of complaints or confusion about the "" nothing you do affects the ending "" complaints I read about. 

This story is fascinating, extremely depressing and merciless. It is pretty F!@#$%^ good.

Open World Roaming grade on well, an open world in a video game: 10
Open World grade on accessibility to roam, explore and take in a developer's creative landscape: 8
Open World grade on transportation i.e vehicle design, vehicle ease of use, vehicle options: 9
Open World grade on npc's i.e. design, personality variants, blend with the story line: 10
Open World overall nostalgia and wonder lust: A big F!@#$%^ 10 and then some.
Open World grade on NPC interaction i.e quips and feedback: 6 <---if there was even a fragment of response options to counter the NPC's with that would have added a metric ton of fun to the game.

The open world is actually incredible and impressively full of passionate details, big city/outer city limits feel and it is really easy to waste hours on end walking around observing the programmed life walking about.

This game is every bit of raw and in your face as you might want it to be. The available in world shards add several new layers of perspective to Night City and maybe a message the dev wants to convey. Hard to tell what might be of stories literary origin or possibly the dev soap boxing, either way the shards at another world to the game, you be the judge of how well  you enjoy absorbing that additional world :p. There is definitely some big thoughts and opinions to chew on in the reading including a few exerts from the Old Testament, yes lol...the Bible is in Cyberpunk 2077.

Protagonist clothing details grade on uniqueness: 10
Protagonist ability to be very ( you ) and show some style in appearance: 11
Protagonist ability to raise hell and bring total mayhem to your surroundings just because its fun sometimes and it really seems to 100% piss off the intended balance of the city: 20 :p. The dev's anal retentive wrath shown in the NCPD spawns & DPS following Police warrants is most definitely not a plus. In fact it feels like you are breaking the game when you piss off the law in this game.

Crafting system grade on ease of use: 5
Crafting system grade on penalty awareness i.e don't do this or you will bork this and that :p : 3
Crafting system grade on creative thinking and merciful component gains: 10

I still don't fully understand the crafting system, mostly because my attention deficit is not the best and I haven't had much experience at all with crafting systems. This introduction was a tough one but worth it.

Perk & Attribute system grade on creativity: 10
Perk & Attribute system grade on ease of use: 7
Perk & Attribute system on functionality in game: a weird 8 ?

 I knew they were there and active (maybe) most of the time but it took a while to really blend with them and feel like I had any upper hand with a lot of it.

Cyberware grade on creativity: 10 all day.
Cyberware ease of use: 10
Cyberware fun: 20

The cyberware abilities are pretty incredible and truly add an entirely personalized approach to combat and story line completion The alternative to hacking was interesting but really failed to impress as far as matching the description to the in combat functionality and feel. Overall tho this one is hard one to review because there is so much to master and experience and even with all the hours I played I still haven't fully tapped it all.

Graphic Performance grade on just overall beauty, digital vibrance & feel: 10
Graphic performance consistency ( per individuals PC obviously ) nonetheless: 5

This game has serious ups and serious downs but is every bit worth every penny spent and hopefully will evolve into more future, bad ass developments/dlc."
1610084470,"As a childhood cyberpunk fan my expectations were high. There are some things the game gets right, but in the end it's just ""meh, another FPS action game"".

""Action-adventure with some RPG elements"" would probably be accurate genre for it. The story is still kinda cool but after you've finished it once I don't see any reason to start it up again.

Now I know the devs worked hard on it but there are some things that I just find freakishly bad and unacceptable (on PC, dunno about consoles): AI is just horrible (as in both NPC's and driving), user interface and item handling makes me want to puke a dozen nails (ok it's not skyrim-level horrible but it is bad), and balance of NPC's / levels / roles is weird - quickhacking is way too OP.

If you've played watchdogs, you could say it's the same thing but with some cyberpunkish graphics, story and very limited body modifications. Also if you are like me, a cyberpunk RPG fan from the 90's, you will be disappointed. Sorry to say this, but I was expecting a lot more, not just watchdogs re-furbished and boxed again. 

It's not all doom and gloom though, the game is beautiful and I'm sure you can spend some time with it, but I would wait until it's on sale and the worst bugs have been fixed. Spending full price on this right now is a ripoff."
1610084470,"Visually one of the most stunning games I've played along with one of the best singleplayer stories of 2020. Personally felt like this was a next generation version of a game like borderlands/assassins creed. If you are coming expecting GTA 5 in the future, you will be dismayed. Leave all expectations at the door and this game will continue to wow you throughout your playthrough."
1610084332,I enjoyed it for some of its bits. But i give it a thumbs down for the deceitful business practices CDPR has done to its consumers. I don't tolerate companies falsely advertising/marketing their products. It's called wasting your money and the company gets to keep it. I will not be EA'd. NO. JUST NO.
1610084267,"This game is a ton of fun. Not even near done with it and I've already racked up over 90 hours. First off, it's no buggier than any large open-world RPG I've ever played. In fact, in my experience it's probably less so. Arguably far more ""action"" than ""RPG"" - a bit closer to Far Cry than Fallout - it is still entirely possible to customize your build towards your preferred play-style and make it through. I went for sneaky, but I can definitely see how a beefier, noisier build could be fun. I've already recommended it to every gamer I know, and I'll will probably be playing for another 90 hours before I'm done,"
1610084128,It may be glitchy at times but it is awesome none the less.
1610084110,"Didn't know they had a bad launch until 3 days later, when I stopped playing to look at the reviews.

The city feels alive, well written characters. Story is good. Bugs are genuinely not bad (on PC)

Hoping for more.  /r/lowsodiumcyberpunk"
1610083966,"Ain't going to lie, I have a hard time finding games that I actually stick to playing. I've bought so many I don't touch after an hour of play time. I loved the Witcher 3, and I loved the Fallout games, but I could never replay them. I have beaten this game (I played it before owning on Steam), seen all the endings, and still wanted to do another run-through. Yes, the game has some minor bugs, but I have not run into anything game breaking. I run the game on high and RTX on with just a 2070 laptop smoothly.

The main story moves a little fast, and to be honest I didn't follow it fully the first time, but it made me interested in the lore and minor details. A lot of the side gigs are interesting in themselves. The NCPD missions are a little repetitive though. The city is beautiful, even on lower settings.

There are a couple things that annoy me. The police in the game, They're pretty bad and apparently have no budget for cars, but have a teleportation machine. You have one chance to cosmetically change your character (minus clothes/armor). And the cars in the game can't be customized at all.

Yes I feel a lot may have been cut out due to time restraints, but I have faith they will patch the game and hopefully add more content in the future. IF and WHEN they add online, I can only hope they do it correctly.

I honestly rarely pay $60 anymore for games, but for me, it was worth it. I enjoyed the experience."
1610083839,"What an absolute MASTERPIECE this game is! I just finished my first playthrough, and every single hour of this game is packed full of excitement, tension, and immersive entertainment. The characters are vivid, the storylines are creative, and the game mechanics keep every encounter interesting. THANK YOU CDPR!
I can't wait to see what new adventures the DLC brings us."
1610083530,Decent game but it isnt finished. the devs made some huge promises with this game and they deliver a half baked product. i almost invested in cd projeckt red but im glad i didnt. ill be clear. this is a good game but it is a mere fraction of what was promised. id have no issues with this game but the devs straight up lied about what was in this game and i think companies should be help accountable when they say whatever they want and deliver something else. I am a huge fan of the other games this dev has made but i will not stand by them while they lie to make money.
1610083516,buggy butstukk fun
1610083405,GG
1610083237,"I really do love this game, but I'm gonna wait until they fix the majority of the immersion breaking bugs before I start playing again. I recommend the same to anyone else."
1610083144,"Don't be a Gonk, Grab a BD, sit back and sharpen your Mantis blades."
1610083029,"Not a pure open world a la Bethesda games
Gameplay is possibly the strongest for any ""RPG"" I've played in the last decade
Sidemissions are very strong
Main Quest is decent enough (story is better than Skyrim/FO4)
Customization options are lacking
Graphics are amazing, most NPCs look good, quest related ones are generally stunning

Very good game if you like story-driven RPGs, but don't expect something incredibly open-ended."
1610082570,it crashes every time i get like 5 minutes in
1610082509,"When it first launched I sat there with my head on my desk wondering ""Why can't my paycheck come faster?!"" and then it got a ton of hate and bad reviews seemingly. So I stayed away for a couple weeks.

The night I sat down and thought ""I don't care! Middle school me watching the teaser loved it; I'M NOT LETTING LITTLE ME DOWN!"" and I bought and downloaded the game.

40+ hours later and I'm still loving the game! The world is just fantastic and feels very refreshing and unique. The fact I can't paint my guns up or change my hair color in a cyberpunk world sucks a bit. But the rest of the game is fantastic! Hours of fun and just absolutely addicting. I haven't played many games this much in a while.

But it really delivers on the cyberpunk action-RPG game really well! I am enjoying the story and all the characters; whether I want to befriend them or murder them. And even the side content really levels with the main content better than a lot of games. Making money isn't super hard, it takes some time but if you could get rich in 2 minutes that'd be incredibly boring. I haven't had any issues with leveling or finding the money for new stuff. More than not my new gear comes from looting anyways. That's one critique on the game I do have; the shops don't seem to carry much good stuff. Like it's often not worth it. 
Another critique of the game I've seen is that it gets ""Too easy"". Which I think is a weird complaint. If you get new gear, and upgrade your cyberware; and have basic mechanical skills. Yes the game does get relatively easy. As it should, I personally can't stand games where no matter how hard you grind they just upscale enemy levels so you never get ahead by much. If you want a challenge, use worse gear, don't upgrade cybernetics; and do content labelled ""Very High"" on their danger level. Try a different playstyle. There's a lot of fun ways to spice up the game.

When you read a bad review check the time they spent on it. Not sure why but I've talked to people who had well over 100 hours in the game and called it bad because ""Not enough content."". 100 hours of satisfactory content seems like a hella good amount of content. Plus if you really don't like a game why do you have 100+ hours on it? If I really don't like a game I either refund or it has like an hour or two on it at most.
If you want a Baulder's Gate old school RPG obviously you're not getting that here. If you want an awesome action-RPG based in a cyberpunk world; it's great.

It's not perfect but it's 100% one of my favorite games in a while."
1610082493,I ENJOY IT that all that matters because i aint a whiny bi###
1610082213,good
1610082189,Disappointed.
1610081852,If you have the hardware for it
1610081687,"Seen some bugs, no where near game breaking and just something to laugh at. If you are thinking about getting this game just pull the trigger and get it. Amazing experience, and plan to play the S%*t out of this game."
1610081442,"Maybe in 6 months....maybe?

Bugs, ok. Absolute lack of quality control, not ok. Graphics, story, concept great, but the game must work to actually enjoy them.

Playing on 3080, 10700K, 32 gb ram- Game now freezes randomly, first seemed linked to the game loading the next area while moving through the city (also when trying to fast travel get the freeze too). Cant access windows task manager, must restart computer. This really takes the fun out of playing the game.

Cars fall from the sky, T pose to show dominance, people spawning in walls, unable to interact with items (sometime quest), randomly dying as you jump and land on an uneven surface.

Too many other good games to put up with this. I'm done."
1610081363,"Cyberpunk 2077 had a rough start, but all in all I had 2 crashes out of the 146 hours I spent in night city. The game play was solid. The side quests were outstanding and the story line is very unique, I thoroughly enjoyed this game completing almost every achievement. I would highly recommend this game long as your computer meets the recommendations."
1610081466,"Quite a few bugs still which will hopefully be polished over time but the world design is unlike any ever created in a video game. It's world design rivals the best of them (Red Dead 2, Botw, The Witcher 3)"
1610081147,nice cock
1610080922,with a 2080 Super and an AMD 3900X it runs at 60fps. Its buggy as hell but still fun to play. Night City is hard to quit...
1610080603,If you pretend the bugs are yours and the NPCs cybernetics glitching out then it kinda adds to the immersion.
1610080566,"really not worth it. this is the type of game some kind of pinterest alt white person would enjoy. the plot is basic, the city is so underdeveloped, there's no seasoning whatsoever : ) 

this aint it : D

no matter how long i play it in one sitting i am more overwhelmed with the awful mechanics and awful attempts at genuine character interactions. a game doesnt need to look so good that you can count the pores on a characters face. it should be effectively written. sorry to see the creators didnt prioritize their work in a way that could have saved me from wasting my hard earned cash : )

i hope some other developer takes this opportunity to say ""hold my drink"" and do something amazing!"
1610080337,"Despite the rough launch, I've been able to enjoy this game. There the occasional glitches, but a majority of them are more funny then they are game breaking. Well worth playing!"
1610080175,"yes
"
1610080058,it was good i was expecting more glitches but there was only about 3 within my first 6 hours of playing
1610080050,"Lots of bugs, some bad writing, terrible AI, a looooot of bugs, bad UI and interface (with a super annoying high pitched sound played in the inventory screen), can only craft single items and it takes about 1sec per item.

Still, the sounds are super satisfying, it has lots of potential, some characters are super interesting, Keanu Reeves, Mantis Blades.

And I still had a lot of fun with it -- buy it on sale and/or after it has been 1 year since this review (Jan, 07, 2021)."
1610079929,"Good story, great looking city, fun combat, but once you beat it, which is easy to do at lvl 50, I played on the hardest difficulty, There is not really any reason to continue playing.. I did all the ending including the ""Secret"" ending and they all made the feels bad except one. all in all once you get past the ""wow this looks cool!"" it is a really shallow game, where your choices (and I tried corpo, street kid, and nomad) don't mean anything. 
waited for years, wanted to love it, gave it a chance, I has regrets."
1610079720,It is a very fun game with many annoying glitches and a lust for the strongest graphics cards on the market. If you are bothered by bugs or don't know if your PC is up to the task then by all means skip this one. But this game is a good one if you can look past a couple of the flaws.
1610079703,Good game if your PC isn't a piece of shit.
1610079605,"if you have the high end PC to handle it, it is one of the best games of the year."
1610079380,"A few bugs, but overall a great game."
1610079362,Story and characters carry this game. Everything else is pretty mediocre. 6/10
1610079273,in its current form its has bugs here and there that arent game breaking but do really drag down the game and break immersion. but the story is fantastic and incredibly investing you want to see what happens with the characters
1610079166,"Crash constantly and cannot progress in the game. I kept trying to give it a shot to get past the crashes, and now my play time is above the time to get a refund.

Game didn't seem that great for what I played, and now I can't play it further and can't get a refund. It's not fun when you can't even use the product you paid for."
1610079122,"Great game, good combat, music, immersion, story, whatever, but god fucking damn is this just plain unplayable until the devs are able to fix more (which is to be expected since the masses rushed them to release). Anyways, my final note is don't listen to the recommended graphics card on Steam and Epic Games being a 1060 LMAO...my ass...."
1610079122,"8.5/10 Explanation below

I LOVED this game, the story, the combat, the world were all top notch. I really felt like this was a universe. Samurai is awesome, V is a great character, and Jackie is the friend we never knew we needed. 

However, I gave this game an 8.5 because when I look at a game comparable to this, like Skyrim or TW3, I expect to WANT to play again. Unfortunately, after 100 hours, I dont really wanna play anymore. With that being said, here are the P/C:

Pros:

- Immersive world that you can get lost in for hours
- Actual different endings with quests unique to it (im looking at you ME3)
- Character builds that differ in play style (unlike Fallout 4)
- Story that is intertwined, yet completely separate
- Customization out of this world with weapons, cyberware, and perks
- An actual ADULT game, its about time video games actually portrayed humans

***********SPOILERS DO NOT READ PAST THIS***************

Cons

- The whole ""your character is gonna die"" thing is really played out. Dont get me wrong, the nomad ending was awesome, but I mean c'mon
- I dont really feel like playing this again, i dont know why, maybe ill change my mind in a month
- While the bugs werent game breaking, but it is still pretty glitchy
- I felt street cred was too easy to get and I wouldve like to see some fixers held behind a cred wall"
1610079076,"Game is great and i really want to play it. But ive had issues with quest bugs where i cant finish quests, so i had to restart my game, then now im having the tree clipping glitch starting on jan. 7th, which i cant fix. So i cant go on... The game is awesome, you know, if it worked..."
1610079063,It's buggy but fun.
1610078955,if your computer has the capability to actually run this game i highly suggest it.
1610078920,yes
1610078853,poopooopoooo
1610078695,"See past the bugs and removed features, and you have a excellent story-driven game"
1610078581,"Story is compelling with likeable characters, many side missions to kill time which are actually interesting and engaging, runs well on 2080 super at max settings."
1610078415,"Pure junk. Fail in every aspect, I asked for a refund and it was denied."
1610078305,Amazing world.
1610078288,"Sure many people maybe complaining that this game was rushed, incomplete, and down right buggy... Well the buggy part is true, but what game have you ever seen that wasn't buggy at launch? One thing that I can confidently say about this game is it does have a very rich story with very thought out characters, and even some great encounters. One thing I do have to say is the game is fairly un-optimized and there are a few issues with lighting, I have found a few mods on Nexus Mods that have helped smooth out this game a little more and made frames more stable.

1610078032,"Epic game. Don't mind the haters and try it. Worst bugs I've seen are the cars not rendering fast enough and occasional T-Posing but besides that, the usual RPG bugs you would see in Skyrim. There are still features missing and I expect CDPR to add them in the near future but if they fail to add these features in a timely manner then I might consider a negative review. For now I think that the game is really beautiful, no game can beat the environment in this game. Driving through Night City never fails to impress to the point that I would rather drive to a mission rather than taking a fast travel."
1610077984,"If you have a specc'd out PC, hands down worth it"
1610077753,"running this game on a 1070 at med. settings 1440p getting around 40ish fps, and im having a blast. Its a fun game even with all the bugs, the side missions and gigs are pretty entertaining and its got a good story. there are time though that i wish there was a little more meat to the game because it does feel like there's something missing. at the time of writing this im on one play through on my 2nd but not that far into the 2nd. setting at 70ish hrs."
1610077701,"this game has receive a lot of hate, but i was suck into this story and the world it's amazing 40hrs in worth every penny"
1610077552,"So after 100 hrs of playing this game, finishing my main storyline of the nomad path and going through the last mission to get around 3 of the i had to choose from endings im going to write this review on what i played. For the sake of being something actually helpful im not going to talk a lot about the bugs and performance because im assume you already know about them and or have read reviews that have talked about this mainly. This is purely going to be be about the game and the story. I will try not to talk about spoilers but please beware that there will be some. 

specs I have to run this game
amd 3700x
RTX 3070 FTW3 Ultra 
32gb of ram

I played the game in 1440p on ultra and had a stable 60-70+ in the dense city outside I would easily break 90-100 frames. there is one street called jig jig street that tanks your frames tho for me around 30-40.

story. 
I think something that pulled me into the hype was the story of this game. The trailers really put you in the seat of this entry crime ready to make it big among the legends of the infamous night city. It shows you that you have 3 choices in terms of who you are. A normad who's born and raised in the badlands and is taught to respect family above all else. A street kids who is loyal to his gang and A corpo slave who may have gotten tired of being treated like shit. 

Now don't get me wrong for the beginning of the game which i spent around maybe 10-15hrs of time playing in it's very different how you meet jackie one of your friends is different the people you are close with are different and the history you share with them. However once you get past that initial act the game narrows a bit in terms of paths. Sure the things you can say and even some of the missions you can access are different (side missions) but for the most part you are the same V as everyone else the problem is the same the goal is the same. If you expected it to be hugely different like i did then don't go into this game things that. Don't get me wrong I think there is enough difference and choices to play this game 3 times or even more if you wanted but in terms of going in things it's 3 different games it's just not that 
Now there is a point in the game were i can see the missions being very different but i have yet to test that. 

speaking of side quests this is probably one of this games highlights. Coming from witcher 3 I wasn't one who played a lot of the side quests but i can see now why some of them are regarded as being better then some of the main ones The side missions are not mandatory at all but they do reward you with not only upgrades/money and lvling but also with the main quest there are options you won't get and even a nice addition to your ending if you interact with certain people I think something that was a little upsetting to me was the impact of the choices you make but let me explain.

In the Witcher 3 when you made a bad choice you knew right away for the most part that it was a bad one it would take a big hit in the story. However, with this game not everything is clear that is until the last 2 acts of the game i'd say is when your choices start to really evolve your game and show you like oh this guy is a good guy or you're a piece of crap. I think it's tough on the game though because some people will not feel like their choices matter and either make choices they didn't really feel towards or not even finish the game to get to that end result.

Game play

The game itself was something i never found boring sure the shooting isn't anything game changing or different from most but it's solid enough for me to wanna keep playing however the melee combat (this is not including cyber ware like the gorilla fists or the mantis blades) felt terrible I would swing this heavy ass bat and the enemy would just take it like a pillow even the katana didn't feel too good but granted it was the better option for me. 

What really pushed me to keep playing was the options you have for who you want to be. For me i wanted to be this Stealthy one punch man who could one shot with pistols but also do stupid amounts of damage with my fists if things got harry. I only briefly used the bigger guns and while those were fine you can really see the difference if you were to say put points into melee rather then your proficiency in guns 

In terms of guns and gun type there are some variety in terms of different pistols, smgs, shotguns, snipers, hand cannons etc.. but don't go thinking they will all look different what i found is they all look the same except for if say pick it up off a gang member then it'll have like spray paint on it. However, the unique guns that you will find are very cool and tend to have their own animations and also perks that are only on that version of the gun. 

Next I'm gonna talk about the world and driving. Driving in this game to me was as close as gta v. It makes it's changes in terms of the type of car you have. For example in the beginning you have this shitty car that doesn't go very fast and has shit handling and trust me you'll be crashing a lot with these lower tier cars. After a bit of grinding I Bought a brand new car that was stupid fast It would hit like 200mph when If the road gave me the chance but it only performed good on the road now off road is where another vehicle would need to be used and there are a lot of options for both road and off road. There is even a achievement you can get if you buy them all. 

The world itself is actually something i enjoyed a lot whether it be when I was stuck in night city traffic (Yes i drove like that I tend not to just crash through people and stuff) or when I would street race at night in this armored truck. They did a really good job making it easy to get distracted from the main quest and encourage you to go and explore and what was even better was the lack of load times. Nothing breaks immersion like load times and while this game had some it was never something i found myself complaining about. 


extra stuff id like to mention 
The music is great even more so the Samurai stuff. 

I wish there was some way to transmog your outfits but sadly you are force to kinda strut along with what is your strongest gear. 

Landmines are bullshit and killed me more than anything in this game.

Crit builds are too strong in my opinion. I beat the game on very hard and was one shotting things pretty consistently

Mentioned above I think very hard is too easy for the highest difficulty 



END

I think the game suffered heavily from the rushed release if you've read anything news about this game. I know that CDPR will finish this game as intended and will even add things they couldn't. Things will get fixed and I know that. So as for now if you can look past all those issues and can run this great unoptimized game. However if you want to wait until it is updated, fixed, and all it's content is out then by all means wait. I think it's a great game now and will be an even better game now. The story alone is worth it for me.


I apologize if i missed anything that you may have been looking for. This is my first review.

1610077503,"As a person who has lots of sex all the time, i can say that this game is 100% accurate to having sex with sexy women. like i do. everyday. this game did not make me horny however. i am not gay. i just have too much sex with real women to spend more than 15 minutes in this game. on the other hand i would recommend this game to people who do not have sex (unlike me because i have lots of sex with women a lot) as there is a naked woman in it and she is naked. she kinda looks like one of my many girlfriends who i have sex with a lot. i have lots of sex. i also an very handsome and women ALWAYS want to have sex with me because i am very muscular and handsome and very good at video games. all my girlfriends say im very good at sex and playing video games and being handsome. one of my girlfriends asked me to have sex with her but i told her i was playing a sex game instead so she started crying and became a lesbian and killed herself because i did not have sex with her. i have sex with women. not men. i am not gay. i am very cool and handsome so girls always have sex with me because i am very cool and sexy. my penis is very big. all my girlfriends like my penis because it is very big and i am very good at sex with my women. every woman ive had sex with is very sexy and so am i. i have lots of sex. i am also very handsome and sexy and i have lots of sex."
1610077365,Needs more content.
1610077284,good
1610077282,"Buggy, but one of the best and most unique games I have ever played"
1610077236,"As of writing this, I have decided to reinstall the game to goof around more because I miss Night City so damn much, now onto the review...

Cyberpunk is probably my dream cyberpunk game. Does that mean its perfect? No, far from it in fact I actually consider it rather equal to the Deus Ex series. Granted they both accomplish different things and have differing goals. One is an FPSRPG Immersive Sim, the other is more a straight up RPG. Its not hard to guess which is which either.

For starters the game is one of the best looking and artistically realized worlds I have ever seen. Its a technical and artistic marvel. The sound work is preem as well. 

It runs well on my 2070Ti GPU (as of writing), but your mileage may very. I had bugs for sure but rarely game or immersion breaking, again your mileage may seriously vary.

Writing wise its not as good as the Witcher 3 but its better than pretty much all their other work combined. The characters, the writing, enviromental story telling and voice acting are just great. On top of that there is some amazing side quests and quest design here. This is why you should above all else play this game.

The combat is solid overall. Its a bit on the rougher side early on and a bit too easy near the late game but thats rather common in these sorts of games. Theres a nice variety of play styles and weapons, just dont expect the depth of an immersive sim like system shock or deus ex. Which leads into the RPG mechanics. While there is a lot of build diversity and the augments are conceptually/in practice mostly awesome it is rather shallow. CDPR games have always had kinda garbage RPG mechanics (in terms of stats and skills) so dont act suprised otherwise. Its far far from the best system but it does what it needs to, even if it wont blow minds or change anything radical.

While the main quests and side quests (30-50 hours worth of it) will make the bulk and the better part of your experience, there is traditional open world side bs. Its not innovative but it is fun as an occasional distraction. Other stuff is clearly tacked on and stupid/pointless like the racing and fist fights. No one enjoys this stuff idk why CDPR is insistent on adding this every time. Id rather a cool Gwent like side game instead of that stuff tbh. The open world wont wow you in any sense but its better than anything Ubisoft ever put out.

Ultimately if you come in expecting the ultimate game your gonna be dissapointed. It can never live up to your Reddit tier expectations. It is at the end of the day, just a video game not the second coming of christ. 
Its maybe not my favorite game of all time (I really wanted it to be because it has everything in it that should make it so) but its probably one of the best games of 2020 and the last generation (speaking of which dont ever play this on a console lol)

9/10 Highest reccomendation

Will be a solid 10 with patches, free DLC and expansions for sure."
1610076972,"TLDR: Have the luck to have a decent system and looking for amazing story-telling, acting, and beautifully constructed world? Preem. You won't be disappointed.

-

Did I laugh? Did I cry? Did I feel angry, or rebellious? Did this game make me think, compare alternative timelines and what the future might behold? Did I talk out loud (to the surprise of my cats)? Did I lose myself? But most importantly, did I emphasize with the story, world, and characters on a level that I haven't experienced in ANY other game or multimedia product?

To all a resounding YES.

The game is not without it's flaws. The open world could use more work. There are moments of emptiness that a completionist would critique heavily. Personally I am of the ones with no game-breaking bugs. At most; V stood on his motorcycle naked like jesus for 2 seconds before putting his clothes back on and riding like a normal person.

I would have loved more interaction with the gangs; I would have loved a bit more importance given to certain aspects to the game that were probably (IMO reasonably) cut. A more responsive VI (why the f*** do people say AI? it's a virtual intelligence folks. No programs have AI.... yet). I would have made the game harder; it would have been more fitting; in certain points. I'm faithful this will be taken into account and will be there in future releases/dlcs/expansions/whatever.

What I got was an amazing story, masterfully told, acted, and reflected. What I got was a world with characters that were important, that I emphasized with. A world that I felt lost in visually. An absolutely amazing soundtrack (apart from original songs, because listening to black metal while riding through the desert is just amazing). An art style reproduced in a living, beautiful manner. 

A world that with all it's horrors (bugs and horrible algorithms included) I feel really sad to leave, because the story has been told (and yes, all stories, all endings). In some moments I really FELT like my choices mattered. A lot of reviews critique that the endings don't follow up certain choices in the story; but when you made those choices, were you filled with doubt? Did you answer instinctively and then think back on whether you made the right decision or not?

It honestly sucks that some people couldn't play this game (console players). This is not the place to review the game for it (we're on steam ffs. and honesty, Do you think sony and microsoft let this game be sold on their platforms without play-checking it first? I don't). If you do have a medium/high end PC though; go ahead choom, this game has an amazing story that envelopes and surrounds you. 

After 130 hours I've gone through all the endings and finished the map 100%, including hidden missions minus one (because I'm not dumb and I don't role-play dumb; some people will get this). 

I love RPGS, and have played a lot of them through the last 30 years. No other game has come even close to having such a grand emotional response.

Recommendation: get the double jump (ankles) cyberware. It makes all the difference.
Money's worth? Oh yeah. If you have a decent system."

1610076587,"I enjoyed the core gameplay loop enough to 100% complete it. There's about 60 hours of content total for a single playthrough but honestly not a ton of value in repeat plays unless you want to try a different combat build. I enjoyed the story and world design (when it works). Some parts are clearly unfinished and janky, so if you're on the fence about buying it I would wait to buy it for sure. As someone who also owns No Man's Sky, I think Cyberpunk is a better game than that was at launch, and if it gets a similar careful and thoughful patching treatment I could see it being an exceptional game in a year's time. For now, it's rough but if you enjoy it in spite of its flaws then you'll get your money's worth."

[b]![/b] Most striking quality
There is no replayability. Lifepaths don't matter. Most missions don't have consequences. No evil choices. No interesting choices. A lifeless cardboard world.

[b]+[/b] Liked
Although lifeless, Night City is beautifully crafted. Photo Mode is easily my favorite feature. Weapons and gore are great. Generally good story - one scene really touched me.

[b]x[/b] Disliked
- Crappy crime system. Laughable driving AI.
- Vehicles are pointless. The only car chases are on-rails mission chases. Fast-traveling is faster. Parkouring around is funner. Lack of parking spots.
- Deceptive marketing. e.g. swimming is shown in the [b]Official Gameplay Trailer[/b], but only one mission involves swimming. The Maelstrom mission showcased in demos is also the most player-choice driven mission in the game.
- Gameplay boils down to doing missions, or the [i][b]NCPD Hustles[/b][/i] where you slaughter gangs, over and over and over. No street racing, gambling, faction system, arcades, or barber shops. Not even the clubs or bars are interactable beyond a shop menu.
- Feels rushed. Bugs and silly UI design choices.

I was hoping for Deus Ex on steroids, but instead got a terminally ill Far Cry.
[spoiler]Enjoy V constantly reminding you they are dying.[/spoiler]

[b]?[/b] Info
I played for 80 hours to 100% completion. I then spent more time exploring Night City, taking photos, and a large chunk of time exploring out-of-bounds as I got bored. I took the Nomad lifepath.

The saving grace of this game is the art direction. The world design is legitimately impressive, the lighting is great, and the textures are beautiful. It's a very pretty game. But under this beautiful facade is an empty, soulless world devoid of any semblance of what makes a game good, let alone a ""masterpiece.""

The story is incredibly hollow. Each ""life path"" offers nothing in the form of a unique experience during each play through other than a different 2 hour prologue before the real story kicks off. After the prologue, the story is exactly the same. The only differences you get are interactions and dialogue options that don't change any story directions. The pacing feels all over the place. The amount of exposition in the first 5 hours muddies the story into this mess of unknown characters and unknown plots. Jackie's friendship is introduced so quickly it's laughable. He tries to rob you, you both get busted, cut to a montage of partying, and boom he's your best friend who you'd die for. Admittedly, Jackie's honestly a fantastic character, but your friendship is established so quickly it feels like CDPR is subtly saying ""just go with it, we didn't have time to add more to this chunk of the story.""

V is boring. He's so one-note about absolutely everything. He could be asking for a slice of pizza, or holding someone hostage, and his delivery would be nearly identical. Everything he says is told through this tough guy filter to the point where it's honestly impossible to relate to the guy. You could try and excuse it by saying ""it's Night City! It's a tough-guy dog-eat-dog world out there! Everyone has to be tough and ruthless!"" But I honestly just think it's lazy writing.

RPG elements are non-existent in this game. Dialogue options feel like they affect almost nothing. I've tried experimenting by reloading and choosing other options, and they only ever amount to killing or not killing people in that specific mission. There's no morality mechanic whatsoever. Your reputation isn't affected at all by these decisions. I feel like this is such a hugely missed opportunity, given the fact that one of the key mantras of Night City citizens is to be remembered after they're gone.

The AI is absolutely awful. There's nothing in the form of self-preservation, so when you shoot at AI, they will fight back without any care of keeping themselves alive. They have no unique interactions in the open-world, they react to crime by raising their hands and freezing in place, and the marketed ""day-night cycle"" does not exist. It was blatant false advertising.

Cops feel completely useless. You can get a wanted level, drive around a corner, and immediately it goes away. They also spawn in and disappear at random. They're just a mess.

The driving is awful. I actually really appreciate how weighty the cars feel as you chunk them into gear when you take off, but something about the way they handle just feels [i]bad[/i]. I think this issue in particular is probably the easiest for them to fix in the future.

Loot items are given far too frequently. I found myself cleaning out my inventory every 15 minutes until I finally just stopped picking up items unless it was worth taking an inventory slot. I understand this is partly done to supply you with crafting materials for the crafting menu (which has no reason to exist), but they need to tone it back a bit.

Speaking of not needing to exist, the leveling tree is so unnecessary. It offers nothing but marginal stat improvements and a [i]few[/i] unique attack moves. It feels like instead of focusing on a few really strong core mechanics, CDPR threw in as many mechanics as they possibly could to try and saturate the game with things to do. Instead, these mechanics feel like an afterthought that clutters the actual game play.

I'm not even gonna bother commenting on the bugs. I could give a pass to the awful performance and horribly glitchy game play if the game itself was worth playing, but it just isn't. It's a shame too, because the cyberpunk genre is a relatively untapped idea, and the potential behind it is huge. For me personally, if they would've went toward a more Bladerunner aesthetic instead of futuristic gang wars and nothing but sex shops, that alone would've made the entire game far more interesting."
1610076415,.
1610076381,"After nearly 70 hours of gameplay i feel ready to write a quick review with some suggestions for the game as well.

First i want to say how amazing this game is. I am completely in love with Cyberpunk 2077. That said there are a large number of bugs, glitches and crashes. Since release i have seen a huge number of these bugs fixed and i do have a fairly beefy PC and for the first 30 hours of game play didn't see a single bug, then it crashed and they started rolling in. But i can say for myself regardless of bugs and issue it hasn't changed how fun Cyberpunk 2077 is.

I think the devs are doing great and i don't want a refund as i can see the game getting better with each update and am looking forward to future content and bug fixes. 

[b]Now onto the annoying things I think NEED changing:[/b]
- First off crafting... Please make it so i can craft multiple items at once. Sitting their holding through hundreds  or thousands of components to upgrade them is just insanity. I changed the files so it only takes 0.2 seconds to craft and it still takes too long to turn common into legendary crafting components.
- Make it so i can re-buy iconic gear, or prevent dismantle and selling (Like with Johnnys stuff). I have accidently dismantled atleast 4 bits of iconic equipment including a katana and my favourite weapon ""Lizzie"" and i'm terrified of loosing the rest so most of it is just sitting in my stash collecting dust. I don't mind having to repay like say 10k each to get them i just want them back at some point.
- Selling cars should be a thing. I have like 7 or 8 cars now and it's kinda full i only want 2 of them maybe 3. Would be nice if the ones i purchased and didn't like i could resell or something.
- Changing the colour of cars would be amazing. So many of the cars being sold i love the style but can't stand the colour of them.
- Sell All button instead of sell wait a sec for the dialog to open then slide the slider to the end (if it works) then press sell and wait a sec for the dialog to close on every consumable.
- Make consumables pickup range less than other items. When i see a pile of cash sitting on a table with 6 drinks around it i'm trying to pick up the cash not the drinks. The area of pickup for consumables is massive compared to everything else.

I think that's about all i got from the top of my head. Honestly i don't expect a game when first released to be spot on perfect. Even in the days of floppy and CD's you used to get patch disks to fix bugs and add features. So much love has been put into the story of Cyberpunk it is a massive thrill playing it and i think the dialog is done too perfection (When the sound works and you don't get 3 people talking over each other cuz it's trying to run through multiple missions at once).

[h1] In conclusion: [/h1]
Story is amazing and really pulls you in. When characters are talking i never want to skip the dialog. Gameplay is fun and combat is so addicting and there's plenty of it. When you get them perfect stealth kills it feels amazing. The game lacks a few quality of life features but i'm pretty positive that Projekt Red will sort all that out as soon as they get through the bugs lol.

If bugs in games annoy you though then it's best to wait before buying the game but i'd highly recommend coming back to it in 6 months or so to check how the bug fixes are coming along. 

[b]Most engaging, fun and exciting AAA title I have played in many many years![/b]"
1610076255,why do you cum
1610076181,If you have good hardware the game runs really well and has an engaging story.
1610076064,"Such a let down, the game might get better in a bit, but for now its not fun, the story is good though."
1610075739,"good game, good characters. big win for weiner accuracy."
1610075703,Love it so far. Some bugs. Most are visual but some interfere with missions.
1610075697,Great game. Has its bugs for sure. Playing at 4k with an rtx 3070 and i7-8700 non-k.
1610075617,no
1610075085,Disappointment
1610074898,"It's got some launch jank because people can't make up their minds about if they want a finished game or a game released right now - and that'll even out over time.

Me and my bwoi Keanu went on a madcap adventure together, making friends with vending machines and sentient guns while treating every human I met like scum. It was great.

2080 Ti with everything set to max, I have had a very different experience to XBoners."
1610074784,"I hate to say this and I didn't want to believe it myself but this games sucks.  i am not talking about the bugs, though they are numerous.  For me it is the details that kill this game.  For example, during a mission that put me in the outskirts of the city on a winding road i was on foot and wanted to take a shortcut.  I found some places where there was a gradual slope and figured ""i should be able to slide down this. I mean i have slid down worse in real life with no injury"" NOPE.  Attempting to slide down the gradual slope consumes half of V's health.  On the same mission, the one with all of the taxis that you have to track down i ended up in the middle of a junk covered field that was impossible to drive through so i had to walk out.  As I was jumping over the same locker about 1,400 times to get out of the field (losing health from the small jumps of course) i noticed that the debris isn't even laying on the ground.  It is all floating in the air and it is possible to get underneath it if you are not careful.  You can't shoot tires out.  I was shooting tires out on PS2 games 20 years ago.  

I could go on and on about everything this game lacks when compared to other AAA titles but really my biggest gripe is that this game just isn't fun.  I love RPGs and I played through all of the Witcher titles so i had big expectation for CP2077 and it turned out to be a major disappointment for me.  If you just have to play I would recommend waiting until you can get it for $20."
1610074762,"I've ploughed through almost every side-mission, and am nearly at the end of the main mission. I loved Witcher 3, played through it and all expansions 3 times over the years. I've got almost 300 hours in this at time of review.

CDPR have shit on all the good will from Witcher 3, with this launch. It's buggy as hell, you HAVE to mod it to make basic things viable (vanilla vehicle handling is like bambi on an ice-rink. You will constantly be running people over and absolutely trashing your ride through absolutely no fault of yours, and it ruins a part of the game with multiple vehicles available to own). The police and wanted mechanic is utterly pointless, with police spawning behind you, wherever you are. You just drive or run or ride a short distance and they forget you exist. Why does it even exist, except as yet another way to annoy the player? Driving itself, from the 1st person view, is night on impossible, with almost your entire screen taken up by the car interior. This is NOT, in any way, an enjoyable experience.

Graphical glitches are irritating - I gather I've been lucky, with floating trees visible through all landscape my biggest issue here, which has made parts of the game unplayable due to being unable to see anything through them. I understand for a lot of people the glitches have made it entirely unplayable.

CDPR have properly shit the bed with this game. I pre-ordered which I never do, because of how good the Witcher 3 was. This? Absolutely not worth £50. Not even worth getting in a half-price sale. I wouldn't buy this now for anything more than a fiver. Maybe in a year, when all of the cut content that was promised throughout the marketing over the last few years (yes, you read that right. YEARS!) is actually in the game, and the bugs are sorted, and things like being stuck wearing a diving suit and unable to change any clothes/armour are fixed, and being able to make cosmetic changes to armour/clothes in game are added, maybe then it will be worth picking up. Otherwise, really do not waste your time or money.

TL;DR - Eat an unwashed, rancid dick, CPDR. You shit on the playerbase with this bollocks. I'll never trust you again."
1610074738,Great story. Only one crash. Few errors. This is with a 1070ti with a 2560x1440 with 1144fps. I used medium/low settings
1610074594,Great Fun! Only minor glitches. Really captures the look of California.
1610074146,Though bugs are prevalent the game slaps. I would recommend if your system can handle it.
1610074100,Bad game. Even without the bugs the game is incredibly average and the features barley work and are nothing to write home about.
1610074093,"It just.. feels like there is a lot of wasted potential here. The intro questline is well done with multiple outcomes, but the rest of the game largely makes you feel as if decisions don't matter. Cars and people flying through the air, crashing into walls, floating guns and burgers aside, I can't help but cringe while trying to take in Night City. Its the ads, mostly; everywhere I look I see ads that feel designed to be edgy but just end up being cringe. It's hard to take in the beauty of the environment when its filled with unicorns that have dildo's pulsing out of their heads, and snakes slithering up legs, it largely feels like a game world designed by virgins. Other than 4-5 quests out of the nearly 100 or so I've completed I've largely not enjoyed my time with the game, so for now I recommend waiting - probably the better part of a year before giving it another try. One of the biggest yikes feelings I've had with a game. I earnestly wish I could have liked it more."
1610074035,"One of the best games I've played for 2020, just waiting for updates to makt it even better! I will give it a solid 8 out of 10 with a chance to hit the 10 once they add more stuff and fix some bugs and glitches!"
1610073929,Was very meh IMO and didnt do anything for me at all but this is my opinion.
1610073622,"Story starts out a bit slow and weapons feel clunky however, everything gets way better and now cannot stop playing it. Tip- do side missions, do not rush through the story.... Highly recommended!"
1610073478,"Extreme bugs, good game, yet needs optimization!"
1610073430,Bugs...bugs everywhere. But who gives a hoot about quest breaking bugs when the game looks this amazing and the story sucks you in like a black hole. Make sure to take your time. Savor the scenery. Doing all the side quests unlocks much better endings.
1610073256,"Cyberpunk is an awesome single player RPG when you put on your hater blocker SPF 9000. Let me start by saying, it's all true, what you've heard about the bugs and glitches. Also, yes, if you have less than awesome hardware, you're experience will be worse. It's no different than a dozen other AAA's just like it.

But if, as like me, the bugs don't bother you all that much, and in fact some of them give you quite a good bit of laughter, you can see a lot went into this game to try and deliver something new and spectacular. I really enjoy the main story, there has been plenty of open world content to keep me occupied, and even if I knew what the game was before I bought it... I'd still buy it. 

If you have $60, get it, it's $60 worth of entertainment... what else are you going to do? Go to the movies?"
1610073227,"If you don't have an RTX video card yet, I highly recommend waiting to play this until you do.  It is good, though the crafting and loot aspects are a letdown.  I am a big Deus Ex fan, and this feels like a more vulgar, open world version of that, and I mean that in the best sense.  It is buggy, yes, but the bugs aren't too terrible... much better than at launch.  The side quests are great and the shooting feels right, but the world isn't as interactive as some titles like Red Dead Redemption 2.  I love dystopian worlds, and this game just oozes cool.  It isn't as great as I'd hoped, and I don't think it's as well written as The Witcher 3, but as far as open worlds go, I think it's a great, humorous, stylish world that will captivate you for hours.  And as I said, if you have a modern video card with DLSS and Ray Tracing, it provides the best visuals you've ever seen - aside from the numerous bugs.  Honestly, I think if you have to save money to get a nice video card, you are actually in the best position - the availability of 30 series cards will be plentiful, and this title will only get better with time through mods, DLC and patches.  Not the masterpiece I was hoping for, but certainly the most appealing open world setting and best graphics I've ever seen.  If you want to be a Netrunning hacker, play stealthily, or shoot people you will have a ton of fun.  I just think that the crafting sucks, you pick up way too many weapons, and the bugs are often really distracting.  If you want a deep RPG, there are many better options out there, just none this gorgeous.  It's not that the RPG stuff is absent, it's just that it doesn't really make you feel unique... I see 3 maybe 4 styles of play possible regardless of stats and perks.  Also, I've heard that there's an illusion of choice - it makes you feel like you are making a difference, but after a second playthrough you figure out how linear it is.  Still, like a roller coaster, you will be thrilled.  Just don't expect to go off the rails too much."
1610073151,"Overall, very enjoyable game. Yes, it does have its bugs...and some may require you to reload a mission a time or two, but I can't say I've had anything considered a game-breaker. Runs somewhat decent on a GTX2070, but the settings are not on high nor is RTX in use (the game still looks great without it). I bought this on day one and is one of the only recent games I do not regretting paying full price for. I already got 1 ending of 5, but there is way more content between little side jobs and full on side character story lines. 

4.8/5 Doritos....would buy again."
1610073051,I like it.
1610072856,good game
1610072852,"Just the Best game with the best story with too much graphics to handle with my good old GTX980. But it's playable with medium-high settings with 40-55 fps. After some time, the game will be good as new with the bug fixes just like witcher 3. JUST PLAY IT. This is a FANTASTIC Game!!!"
1610072719,game is good
1610072666,"Despite BS about cut content and glitches. The game is fun, plenty to do, not too many fetch or escort quests. Gunplay feels like the primary gameplay but you can punch your way through the game as well. Fashion suffers a bit by being harder to keep your armor or defense on par with what you could get by picking up or constantly creating newer and unfortunately better pieces.  Story is rather good in many places giving it a good or great overall, but not spectacular. Focus on the main story makes a shorter playthrough then many but long enought to feel okay. Take care and enjoy Night City."
1610072500,"Content content content.  I have enjoyed this game for over 40 hours.  It is immersive, the graphics are beautiful, and I have felt I got my money's worth.  Will definitely play it again and make different decisions just to experience the stories.  They have done an excellent job with this game."
1610072446,"Never was a part of the hype train for this game so when it came out it was just amusing to hear how bad of a launch it was (like most big games these days). I went in buying this game with very low expectations and my expectations were surpassed. The story and characters are the highlight of the game for sure as the rest is pretty buggy. Honestly reminds me of Fallout 4 and how buggy that game was. Though unlike Fallout 4 (in my experience) no bug was game-breaking in cyberpunk. 

The game would be next to perfect if it got polished. Though as it stands now I have to say I would recommend.

Side note here on performance:
Specs: Xeon E3-1240 V3 (pretty much a i7 4770), 16 Gb 1600MHz DDR3, Gigabyte RTX 3060 ti (upgraded from GTX 960 right before buying game)
I have it all on high settings with no ray tracing and no DLSS. 

I will say I expected more performance from the game (40fps average in city, 20 fps in little market areas, and 100fps + outside night city. I think most of the framerate drops are from my CPU not being up to date (chip is from 2013). I do expect some performance updates in the future and free content as there are still things that were promised that were not delivered.

After beating the game twice (as Street kid and as Nomad) I rate it 7/10 as of Jan 7th, 2021 Version 1.06"
1610072362,"other than the bugs, it is pretty good"
1610072276,Honestly went in with doubts about glitches and hearing about the issues. but i had a blast loved the world it puts you in. ive struggled getting into story games recently but this just had me so engrossed in it. if you can handle some weird stuff every now and again this game is amazing.
1610072237,Hnggggggh!
1610072208,Big Penis
1610072178,"Despite the many bugs in the game, I thought Cyberpunk had a very interesting story line with so many different routes you could take. I would get into talking about the side missions, etc but honestly even with 39 hours in the game I havent even completed half of them. If you are into this style of game and can over look some bugs,  i would highly recommend giving cyberpunk a try. (On a side note, if you are playing with controller beware there is a bug that causes you to lose control over your right analog stick. All you have to do is save wherever you are and relaunch the game. not game changing but a slight annoyance. It only happened 3 times for me though.)"

1610072115,Best game I have ever played!
1610071870,"While I have enjoyed my time playing this game. It's really only fun if you shut your brain off. It's a decent game if you mainline the story but the open world activities are truly horrid. It's like playing two games at the same time. 
I can forgive the devs for not fulfilling everything they set out to do but some of the omissions are just glaring. Having no ability to customize your player's face after the beginning is insane. Also barely having any scenes dedicated to customizing your body is a shame too. The AI is also some of the worst ever seen in an open world game. 
And this leaves with me with the biggest issue of this game: it parades themes of LGBT and marginalized groups without actually really delving into them. An example being that the game has both female and male strippers but male strippers remained fully clothed. Another example is the option to customize your genitalia in the creator without ever seeing it again in game. It's a shame that a triple A game was about to take the next step in sexual/gender identity and stops halfway at most.
I wanted to give this game an OK rating but it gets lowered since this is clearly an early access game."
1610071667,7/10 would not play again
1610071634,"Bought the game on launch day and gleefully played for the next 15 hours or so.  around that point my saved game became corrupted, and I went to a previous save to try to get around that point, but around the same time in the game my save became corrupted again.  

I decided to restart, played another 15 or so hours into the game, and encountered the exact same problem.  I'm now 31 hours of play time into a game that is apparently critically bugged, preventing me from advancing past the first quarter of the storyline.  I have asked steam for a refund but have been rebuffed several times, as my 31 hours of play time exceeds their maximum amount of time to receive a refund.  I just stopped playing, considered the money a loss, and hoped maybe someday they would release an update that would make it playable again.  

As for anyone who hasn't yet bought the game, I HIGHLY recommend you wait for that update and confirmation that the game has been finished fully in a playable state before purchasing.  Steam will happily take, and keep, your money after selling you an incomplete and unplayable game."
1610077690,"This game is a disappointment. I am not talking about the bugs. The game is stupidly filled with bugs but I wish that wasn't the case so the focus could be on why it is just a bad game. In summary, from the AI to the story, to dialogue choices, to gameplay mechanics, this game lacks so much. It's like CD Projekt Red just cut down on so much of the actual content that could've made this game what they promised it to be. Nothing you do matters. The only choices you make that truly ""matter"" are in the last mission. The AI is so bad in every aspect of the game that talking about it makes me wonder if they really put 80% of their budget into marketing and Keanu Reeves. I love Keanu Reeves, but I wish they spent more time and money on other characters like Jackie. The intro cutscene after your unimportant lifepath choice just shows how much they cut out from this game. Instead of spending time with Jackie and doing missions with him, you are given this lazy video about how you guys are best friends and did a bunch of shit together. I have a feeling they originally planned for you to actually do those missions and bond with Jackie more, but they ended up cutting it up into a short intro video. I am by no means saying the developers did not work hard enough. I know the team there was incredibly passionate about this game during development. But from a consumer standpoint, they should have delayed the game indefinitely. ""Coming when it's ready"" my ass. One of my friends said they would get Watch Dogs Legion instead of 2077. I thought they were crazy. When I imagined how Legion would turn out to be, I thought it would be another copy and paste Ubisoft game that had a map filled with a checklist of things to do, broken mechanics and AI, and a bland experience. Turns out I was describing Cyberpunk.

Now, throughout my playthrough, I still enjoyed the game to a certain extent. I was completely immersed in my first 2-3 hours of gameplay. The first mission was amazing. Experiencing Night City during the drive with Jackie as the rain fell on your windshield was awesome. Seeing the neon soaked streets and advertisements got me so excited. But it seems like things only went downhill from there... The graphics and style is beautiful. It is actually pretty well optimized on PC, considering how large and beautiful the game is. There is so much detail and beauty in Night City. Too bad it's literally filled with only sex shops that you can't even interact with, and AI shopkeepers that don't give two shits about you throwing a grenade at their face. This game was hyped to stupid levels and it was 70% because of CD Projekt Red's promises and vision for the game, and 30% because of the fan base (which is to be expected from this kind of large project). I LOVE the Witcher 3, where your dialogue choices actually affect the story, the story wasn't rushed and the characters feel meaningful. I wonder how CD Projekt Red can fix this game. Will they completely rework the AI and add the features they promised? Or are they just going to add an online mode and some story DLC? This game had so much potential, and maybe it still does post release, but only time can tell.

One more positive note. The language support in this game is phenomenal. I played the game in English and Chinese and the voice acting is incredible and the facial animations are brilliant and actually match what the characters say."

I really tried to like this game, it has a lot of good stuff like a lot, and i have play it for 40+ hrs in 10 - 28 fps... But the technical issues overwhelm everything, I haven't  finished it but I wont until  CD PROJEKT RED patches the living cr@p out of it and I can get at LEAST 40+ fps consistently.

Score with sex change option in game: 9.89/10

1610070617,"I have 30 hours in and something about the game doesn't seem worth the 60$. While the game is fun and has a story that is interesting at times I don't have any dedication left to finish it. Bugs aren't too bad most of the time but can be annoying sometimes and take away from the experience. Maybe when this game updates more and if on sale I would recommend it, but right now I would say no I do not recommend it.

TL;DR - Nothing special. All hyped for just another rpg experience."
1610070322,"I could write a long review, but honestly I just feel whelmed, it wasn't terrible, its not the worst game i ever played, it just feels like [u]""another game""[/u]. 

Whatever, go buy Hades.

Also Deus Ex. [b] JC Denton > V [/b]"
1610074080,"My issues with this game are interestingly different than what a lot of people have. Beyond the well known bugs... I did not enjoy the writing [i]at all[/i]. To clarify I played through the game on the 'corpo' origin. I was genuinely shocked at how short the introduction was. I am not talking the long time before you actually see the Cyberpunk 2077 splash screen but the part that is unique to your 'origin'. It was maybe... 5 minutes? You then get a fast paced clip montage that is supposed to establish all of your emotional attachment to Jackie Welles and some of the various 'fixers'. It did not accomplish this at all.

The story itself is 'okay'. My main problem is with the pacing and story/character consistency. My issues with the pacing focus around character interactions. People introduce themselves to you and they immediately start bantering with you like you guys are old friends. The same goes for your interactions with some characters. The most egregious example I can think of off the top of my head is the first time you meet [spoiler]Judy[/spoiler]. Within about a minute (and the same conversation) you start interacting with them like you have known them for 20 years. 

Story/character consistency is my other main problem. There are two ways you interact with characters in the story (both main story and the 'main' secondary quests), audio interaction (be it face to face or over the phone) or by text. It is clear to me that two completely separate teams who never met or spoke did these. Assuming the actual animated and voice over'd character interactions are the 'canon' personality of the person, the team who did the 'text' interactions had no clue who they were actually writing for. [Spoiler]Takemura[/spoiler] is the most egregious example of this. In addition, what you 'say' over those texts and how the other character reacts often has no relation to one another at all. 

My 'theory' on these problems can be broken down as follows:

Pacing: I think there was more stuff in the script they didn't have the time/opportunity to animate/VO or whatever and thus a lot of stuff that would have built character relationships was cut out of the game... and then the rest of the script was not adjusted

Consistency: I just think it was two separate teams doing this and no one QA'd the interactions and said 'Yes this makes sense'.

Maybe this stuff will be fixed in DLC's. I am more than willing to give CDPR the benefit of the doubt and wait to see what happens. But if you are looking for something more than gratuitous eye candy, I wouldn't bother right now with this game."
1610070046,fun game and challenging
1610070029,"Despite the bugs, which really didnt ruin the PC experience at all and didnt happen that often anyway (mostly crashes), this is a game with an amazing story line. So much so that many of the people that finished the game were emotional for days and even weeks afterwards. The game touches you in a deep way, it has been a long time since I had so many emotions from a video game or a movie experience. The game is beautiful, but you will need a powerful machine to appreciate that fully. Until they do some serious optimizations this is an experience some people may want to wait on, just to have the best possible visuals. That or get a 3080/3090. This game is not perfect, its not polished, but it is powerful and you can tell the developers put a lot of heart into it. I would say this is a ""must play"" game for anyone that enjoys this type of a game."
1610069957,"I know there have been tons of bugs, but honestly it's not a bad game. I'm not condoning what they did to the gaming community and saying it's okay, but for what it's worth, it's a pretty good game.

On a side note, the game looks like it bugged out the time,.. I've put in somewhere around 50-80 hours,... no way 245 hours at the time of writing this lmao.

The main story quests and side quests involving main story quest characters are amazing. It's my favorite thing about this game. I love that Jesse Cox is in this game, that quest alone hyped me up so early in the game. I couldn't stop laughing and grinning for the next hour. Otherwise, just like the witcher3, even on a harder difficulty once you get high enough lvl or stats and beat that initial bump in the beginning of the game, the game mechanics/enemies become pretty easy. I tend to go into missions either feeling unstoppable or just trying to stealth my way through for fun. I went a full reflex/cool build focused on pistols and blades, mainly to embody johnny silverhand, and it is a blast. I imagine the other builds feel separate enough to make it enjoyable, I plan on trying the respec and seeing what else I can try.

Environment wise, I enjoyed night city. Everyone complains about the ai, so I'll pass over that, but the environment themselves were very pretty to look at. Taking a few photo shoots were actually pretty fun. I think there are many things they can do to improve the quality of life for gamers that I wish was in. Stuff like changing your hairstyle, go to messages directly when you have quest updates(looking at you regina), weapon sets (so I can have my non-lethal / lethal / fun sets), craft more than 1 item a time (I really wanted this, imagine spending collectively hours watching youtube just clicking and holding a button), and I'm sure many other things if I spent more time thinking about it.

I'm excited to see how the game evolves as time goes on, I definitely think it's worth it still and honestly with my computer build, I only saw 2 game breaking glitches over the course of ~80 hours. I'm no critic however, and very minor bugs didn't bother me much."
1610069806,So far I like it
1610069803,"once finished the story there was no point going back to the game, stupid AI that you can't interact with, no character customization or even armor transmogrification , no vehicle or weapon customization, life paths doesn't change the way you play the game, choices in the game are just an illusion, boring skill tree, awful melee  system and a lot of other stuff.
the game just feels empty beside all content and features that was removed from the game. 
the game was hyped on lies."
1610069764,"Seriously if you guys have a problem with bugs and glitches wait for a while for them to be fixed.

I have played this game some and then some more to unlock all the achievement (thanks steam guide!)

All in all, I really enjoyed my time with the game, yes even with all the immersion breaking bugs (even funny at times) The game is a gta esque in the way that everything intersting (except secrets and easter eggs) are on the map for you to go from place to place. You have a lot of (although repetitive) mission to do for the police and gigs you get from fixer. Nothing revolutionary in the quest department too go there kill that, go there fetch that. Go there fetch/kill that without being noticed and you'll get a nice bonus. The main mission are nice storywise (I liked it personnaly) The phone call are worthy of some cousin asking to go bowling and sometimes happen mid mission while other npcs are talking which can be quite frustrating.

The romance are quite lackluster to be honest and not really a super interesting part of the game. They feel rushed and quite out of place sometimes (looking at you Kerry)

All in all I recommend waiting a while before buying to let the dev have some time to fix the issues with the game. Also, if the game is on sale, buy it"
1610069748,It's a great game despite all of the glitches I don't recommend it unless you have a decent or beefy pc!
1610069725,"Absolutely love this game!!! I bought it twice, one for the PS4 and one for my PC. Have around 100 plus hours so far and on my second play through. Completely worth the wait. Thank you CD Projekt Red for the amazing experience!!!"
1610069659,judged too harshly still a great game if you can run it
1610069536,"Before you read my review you need to understand that I am someone who casually enjoys RPG games and I high tolerance for bugs.
Cyberpunk has a great foundation, night city is amazing Silverhand is a cool character and the overall feel of the city is incredible. However where Cyberpunk makes great strides it is bogged down by its numerous amount of bugs, now most of these bugs are gamebreaking and it totally ruins the immersion. I would honestly wait a year or two before picking up this game just so that the bugs can be fixed."
1610069497,the memes
1610069316,"The witcher 3 is one of the best game I've ever played so I was thoroughly looking forward to this game (like the rest of the world). I did really try to give it a chance despite all the negative reviews...however I would not reccomend this game even after the glitches are fixed. I say this after I beat the game multiple times through different lifepaths and did numerous side quests. 

Pros:
-The design of the entire game (world, cars, characters, etc.)
-Voice acting of all the characters
-Soundtrack
-Keanu Reeves/Johnny Silverhand

Cons:
-Glitches (enough said)
-Story is only 20 hours long which is far too short for an $80 game
-The combat and movement is clunky
-Phonecall system interrupts you during missions and other character conversations (no way to decline calls)
-Too many text messages that are frustrating to check
-The menus are slow and way too cumbersome to navigate 
-Characters frequently talk over each other during important scenes
-No auto drive feature/driving controls + physics are poorly done
-Delamain missions will constantly interrupt you if you do not finish them anytime you get within a few KM
-NPCs are brutal, they seem lifeless 
-The chip malfunction sequences last for too long
-The menu music loudly beeps every 10ish seconds you are in the menu
-No option for 3rd person (give us the choice and let us play how we would like to)
-The missions, menus, combat, etc. is all very generic and nothing new was tried (e.g. Ghost of Tsushima lets the wind guide you to objectives instead of waypoints). Cyberpunk insisted it would be the most innovative game ever but did not try really anything new.
-Incoming quests automatically activate and replace the current quest you are in the middle of
-The overheating system in combat was bad, I would get overheated from enemies on different floors
-V's apartment is pointless, you are there twice the entire game
-Quests do not show off the world lore or city very much
-No context on world (the witcher 3 walked you through the story so well you did not even have to play the first 2 games or read the books). In cyberpunk I felt like there was this really cool backstory that never got explained properly.
-V becoming a legend as a story focus seems forced when they only thing we did was attack Arasaka tower (which Johnny and his friends had done twice before)...it felt like all the missions and quests beforehand were irrelevant. How exactly is V a legend when we've done nothing noteworthy besides small quests?
-The map is beautiful but small and not as vertical as the developers promised...much of the map is window dressing and inaccessible. 
-The game says it is an RPG but the choices you make in the game don't really change anything. There are a few different endings but this game feels like the developers are forcing down the story they created and the player makes no impact at all besides being along for the ride. It feels more like an interactive movie then it does an RPG

Hope this helps! If the game is on sale for like $20 and the upcoming DLC makes some aspects more interesting I might say give it a chance because there IS a lot of potential for it to be a good game. However, I would say this game is mediocre at best- 6/10
"
1610069247,"First things first, I'll say this: Buyer Beware. Know what you're getting, and what you have to run it on.

Basically, yeah, its a good game. Mostly in that it tells a great story, the world is cool, the characters are cool, the writing is pretty good, and the combat varies from serviceable, to pretty fun actually.

Granted, some perks are pretty useless, other perks are ACTUALLY useless, pretty sure Armor doesn't do anything, and the AI is definitely special at times. But both guns and melee feel pretty good to use, full-on guns blazing works, silenced guns work, takedown stealth builds work, hacking works, katana builds seem OP. 

The game lacks some pretty basic, but also trivial features. cosmetic systems, third person mode, etc. That stuff will likely get added in later, but whatever. Driving is pretty bad, but you're driving in an RPG, so its good enough. It's buggy I guess? but I personally didn't really run into many problems on a middling laptop. non relevant NPCs are literally brain dead throwaways, children appear to just be shrunken adults (lol), everyone drives like utter shit, but honestly I beat the game the first time never noticing because I don't screw around with random NPCs, and never expected it to be GTA 2077.   I did see one club goer T-posing in 40+ hours, at Lizzie's I think. They patched the bald reflections. It only happened if you were wearing a helmet anyway, and as stated, armor is pretty pointless, so i stopped wearing helmets haha. 

As a cyberpunk future second life simulator, this ain't it, at least not yet.  However, if you want a narrative experience, that tells a compelling story, and can also deliver on a bit of cyberpunky power fantasy, (and you've got a rig that can run it) you'll probably find a lot to like in here."
1610069221,"Is fun.
Lot's of stuff.
Keanu good."
1610069248,"The game is OK but it's far, and when I say far, I mean star wars in a galaxy far far away far from what they hyped this game up to be. I wouldn't consider buying any CD Projekt Red games at all after this experience, wouldn't want to waste my money another another hyped trash like this again. I truly wish I could get a refund.

They advertised Gal Gadot to us, and gave us Kim Kardashian."
1610068958,"I absolutely loved every minute of playing this game. The story was great but what really stood out was the voice acting. It was exceptional and immersed me deeply into the world and my character. In particular, the female V voice acting is absolutely stellar."
1610068868,"Good game on PC, buggy but...the main story is compelling."
1610068715,"I don't normally review games on here but I felt like i had to for this one. Now you might be wondering why I said No to if I would recommend this game to a friend and my reason for that is simple. I firmly believe that there's no way to know if you're going to get a copy of the game that works or doesn't work. I base this on the fact that mine and many others games are unplayable/ buggy as **** while there's also a side that can play the game perfectly fine without any major things happening. As far as my experience goes, I would rather play Fallout 3 with no mods than play anymore of this game (even though i can't because my game crashes whenever I receive a call). I really wanted to like this game, I truly did but i can no longer look past the NPCs with no textures, the invisible cars, the invisible weapons, multiple crashes, and now this game breaking bug. I might recommend this game in the future if it ever gets completely fixed but there's no way I can lie to someone and say that this game is polished and wasn't rushed and pushed out the door."
1610068642,"All the criticisms on Cyberpunk 2077's bugs, AI, optimization, and marketing are definitely justified, but the unreasonably high hype was also to blame. I did not want ""a next generation of open world adventure."" I just wanted a cyberpunk-themed RPG, and I got a cyberpunk-themed RPG — a damn good one at that. The folks at CDPR definitely got their cyberpunk genre themes right and the story, characters, worldbuilding, art, etc is absolutely amazing. As a cyberpunk fan this is the best game I've played."
1610068628,"The storyline is good, not amazing or great.  The backstories are interesting but nothing new.  The concept and underlying crisis is definitely unique I'll say that much. 

The real issue is that, during my two stories I wasn't able to experience the game as intended.  The glitches and game breaking bugs made it really dissatisfying.  The bosses weren't in play and what I mean is that they spawned and just stood there soaking up damage until they died.  The music and lead up to each boss was intense and I was pumped to take them down and then 2 seconds into the fight I realized that they were just standing there looking at the floor...soaking up bullets.

The cut-scenes were enough to keep me interested through the game but that pumped up feeling you get when you get a good chunk of the story thrown at you quickly disappeared when you took back control of your character and fell through the world or wasn't able to see the weapon in your hand, could no longer hear the audio suddenly but still had subtitles.  I must've spent about 30% of the game just reading subtitles silently because of that bug.

All in all I couldn't recommend it in its current state, the sheer number of refunds on a game that was hyped to blow Skyrim out of the water is embarrassing.  I don't pretend to know what caused this or why the game released in its current broken state but regardless I'm the customer and I bought a broken product that didn't work when I paid to use it.  It's now sitting in my steam library as a constant reminder of why you shouldn't purchase games when they're first released."
1610068430,Story is Good. Game play is 7/10. No end game. Literally nothing else to do once you complete Main/ALL side quest. Game is not even close to being ready.
1610068415,"Bugs aside, i love this game. Visuals, Story, etc...."
1610068065,"My experience with this game has been really different from what ive seen all over social media. I have had very little game breaking glitches, glitches, or even crashes. I love this game, but the story is really disapointing. The side missions, and even some of the gigs are great. The characters are so interesting, and really fun to see how they play out through the story. Overall, i think its a great game, and with future updates, it will be even better."
1610067850,jesus christ this is the most stunningly beautiful game i have ever played.
1610067839,"I've been lucky enough to not have a terribly glitchy experience with CP2077, and god DAMN it is easily my favorite RPG of this generation."
1610067810,This game is quite literally life changing. the story goes above and beyond what any game has ever done before.
1610067631,Fantastic game!
1610067625,solid game
1610067609,"The game just isn't ready yet. Its as big as an ocean but as deep as a puddle, way too many features not working, missing, or just half baked. Give it another 6 months and 10 patches. Never preorder"
1610067547,Great worldbuilding and fun combat
1610067530,top 3 of games I have ever played.  do it already!
1610067525,yep
1610067308,Absolutely amazing
1610067159,"Cyberpunk 2077 was probably one of the most expected games ever. And despite all the shit this game is (quite rightfully) getting, its still a pretty solid single player game. The game doesn't run particularly well, has quite a lot of annoying bugs and does feel a bit unfinished overall, but it still offers quite an entertaining experience.

At the time this review was written, I have played through the game once. Not going to say that I completed 100% of it, but I did do all the quests I could find, and completely cleared the map of all markers. The main quest line and the story were alright, despite feeling a bit short. They did a good job of making characters with depth and character. However, the grind of clearing the map of all crimes (assaults etc.) was pretty boring, but most of the side quests were designed well and were entertaining, even though some quests felt like they might have been cut short. 

The gameplay might have been a bit better, but it wasn't bad. I played on the second highest difficulty (Hard) and ran a stealthy, pistol and hacking based build, and the gunplay etc. felt pretty solid, even though enemies did feel a little bullet sponge-y at the start. The graphics are pretty amazing, but the game does run pretty shit. I have a 2060 Super, a Ryzen 7 1700X and 16 gb of RAM, and on medium-high settings my fps was 30-90 depending on the density of the environment.

Now, on the bugs. I never encountered anything properly gamebreaking, but I did encounter some fairly annoying bugs, for example one where I couldn't shoot a certain pistols when ADS-ing. Loading a save always fixed this, but it happened relatively often.

In conclusion, in its current state the game is nothing special, but it's nevertheless a good game even in its current state, and I'd happily but it again knowing what the experience would be like. What excites me however is seeing what the game'll be like in a year or two assuming CDPR fixes the bugs and adds some of the cut content back into the game and makes DLCs. Then, the game could become something as great as Witcher 3. On a final note, I'd say this game would rank somewhere between 6th-10th on my list of 
single player games I've played.

8/10"
1610067107,ITs GOOD SHIT!!!!
1610067071,yeah pretty good
1610066898,Enjoyable and playable despite of bugs and hope they will bring back the cut content.
1610066622,My friend Eishan said good game but i no
1610066564,Buggy as hell. there is a game breaking bug where Mr. Hands won't call you and you can't progress and finish the story
1610066538,dope
1610066469,"I may be the odd one out here, but I'm loving this game.
Yeah, sure a few small glitches here and there, all of which have been small visual things - nothing ""game breaking.""
I've experienced fewer glitches in Cyberpunk than in AC: Valhalla. 
Graphics are great with a 2080 Super and a 1080 ultrawide.
Storyline keeps pulling me back in for more - currently holding off the final mission and pulling some side stuff.
"
1610066265,"Despite initial stability issues, the hotfix seemed to repair all of the issues I was having."
1610066125,"Mozart died while composing his Requiem leaving it unfinished, but the seed of genius was already planted and developed enough that a lesser artist could come later and wrap it up. Even with this break, Mozart's Requiem is a masterpiece and deeply moving. So is Cyberpunk 2077.

The genius of the game is present and can be felt everywhere, even in its less than perfect moments. Allow yourself to get immersed in the game, and play it with eyes wide open, for the love and care put in this came shines here and there in the most unexpected places."
1610066104,"I don't know how many endings there are, but I've run through five ""different versions"" of the ending and they were all wholly unsatisfying. Not much of a choice between them. This game isn't done, and these endings are the biggest indicator that CDPR needed more time to work on this. I shouldn't walk away from a game with a feeling of being cheated of an engaging story and likable characters. What a shame."
1610065833,"Honestly it's a lot better than most releases nowadays everyone just jumped on the hate train. It's a good game in its current state, just play it instead of listening to a bunch of whiny babies."
1610065738,Non stop crashing.
1610065613,"I'm not going to touch any technical aspects of this game, you've probably already know all about them on the Internet. 
This review will be concentrated on the game itself.
There are two basic approaches toward the cyberpunk genre these days. The first is mostly cosmetical: flashy, neon-violet colors, 80s music, 80s philosophy and a huge pile of nostalgia for millenials remembering the past days when they were still young. There is nothing bad with that style, but that just it: a style. The more serious way is connected to the authors trying to stick to the cyberpunk philosophy: the conflict between the person and the constantly changing world where the big money tries to control your very soul. This conflict is a fuse for a lot of great stories.
And I certainly believe that Cyberpunk 2077 is one of such stories.
At the surface level you see a simple story of a simple merc climbing the cruel ladder of success in Night city. This life is usually relatively short, shorter even compared to such a violent place like the world of Cyberpunk 2020. The second layer is the past. The collective image of the past eras, Johnny Silverhand. He's reincarnation of the anti-hero of the 80s - a relentless rockerboy on the path of revenge. His interactions with V and the world is what makes this story so unique. It's a conflict again: a conflict between rebellion and pregmatism, between a great person and the mundane world, between radical dreamers and down-to-earth survivalists.
But the true identity of this game is at the bottom, it's what makes ths game a contemporary masterpiece. Cyberpunk 2077 sticks to the foundation of this genre: a dystopian future where everything crumbles in the path of a raging corporative beast devoiring the world in its ever growing hunger. The main anthagonist of the game is not a person or a Dark Lord, it's a collective image of corporations which has taken over the world and they cannot be stopped. Yes, cyberpunk genre was always critical towards capitalism in its extreme, final forms. And it's growing ever disturbing how the real world is changing  into just that dark future.
So, Cyberpunk is a great game. It a true cyberpunk. But what else? It's a ls a good story, actually quite a collection of them. But it's also a small world which makes you return to the Night city again. It's alive and it's believable. You immerse into it and after resurfacing after almost 200 hours you will regret that is just a game that has its limitations. I personally want that CDPR would stick to the game for a while. I want them to create more stories in this immersive world. There is so much potential, so I will definitely wait for more."
1610065421,"Was this game worth my money? Probably since i played it 90 hours.
Should you buy it? No, just wait untill they release the rest of it first.
"
1610065323,My father left me
1610065103,Despite its flaws it is an awesome story!  Higher difficulties are very fulfilling to complete
1610065098,"In most basic sense this is an action RPG with a serious story line.

That doesn't describe it. 

The story. The characters. They are very good. They hit hard. CDPROJEKT did a great job there and just like W3 the game makes you feel things. Sometimes against your will.

Minute by minute gameplay is good. Sometimes feels like GTA, sometimes like Borderlands, sometimes like MGS. There are some glitches but compared to, say, any Bethesda product this runs smooth as hell.  I have not come across anything remotely game-breaking. 

Honestly. If you loved W3. If you love good story telling and raw characters. Buy it. You will love it."
1610065064,"TL;DR - great story, few bugs, imbalanced gameplay

One of the few games I've taken the time to get all the achievements. Don't believe everything negative you hear about this, it is worth every penny. Just be sure to research how to optimize the settings according to your specific setup. My rig is several years old and I was able to run this on medium-high settings with few frame drops and a single crash very early on (could have been bug-related). 

Speaking of bugs, there are certainly quite a few in this game as of this post but CDPR seems to be on top of patching things up. Most of them are just funny but I did encounter a couple entire quest lines that are unplayable (looking at you, Delamain!).

Gameplay mechanics are kinda silly, even on the hardest difficulty. Depending on how you build your character, you're either immortal or you die in one shot. It's tough to find a nice balance because the enemies are drastically different levels depending on which area of the city you're in. The same goes for weapons, you can't just pick up a random purple gun off the ground and expect it to be serviceable. Depending on your pick of talents and weapon mods, you're either two-shotting everything or they enemies are sponges. Driving is rough, you're either flooring it or not and you can only turn at a 90 degree angle each way due to mouse and keyboard. It becomes manageable as you get the hang of it. Hope they have options for better throttle and steering controls in the future.

Get this for the story, not the gameplay."
1610065004,it good
1610064984,"good game. story action game, not an rpg."
1610064927,good game
1610064512,Glitchy and doesn't do anything new. Not the worst thing I ever played but it's not that good
1610064480,it sucks.
1610064356,"Fix the game with mods and enjoy. I've only taken this time to review it because it just crashed, and it's still a fantastic game. If your hardware isn't good, you're going to have to compromise with what could be a very beautiful and immersive RPG experience into something's that's still immersive, good-looking, and fun."
1610064298,I began to wonder if CDPR put all their full-time devs on the next Witcher game and let interns finish this one. Great achievement for interns! Next Witcher game please!!
1610064283,"Cyberpunk 2077 is not perfect, but it really is worth the money and is only going to get better with time! From stunning visuals, to deep characters, to quirky sidequests involving AI taxis -- it's obvious that an immense amount of love and care went into this game.

Cyberpunk does have it's issues, but it's not the calamity that so many people make it out to be (at least not on PC). If you're like me and have pretty capable hardware, you won't have most of the issues that the internet is so fond of reiterating. I ran everything at high or ultra settings without ray tracing, and only encountered a few bugs (nothing out of proportion with your average AAA release). If you have lower-mid tier hardware, you might want to wait until CDPR has had a chance to patch things up a bit.

One word of advice -- don't go in expecting Blade Runner. I say this because it happened to me. It's not Blade Runner. It's Cyberpunk. It's literally in the name... If you accept it for what it is, you're going to have a blast!"
1610064202,Worth it
1610064136,"I really love the world and I think the style of this game is incredibly cool, it really is a shame what happened with this release because it really is a good game at its core."
1610064100,"the only reason im recommending this is because it will make you wanna upgrade your PC just to look at how beautiful this game is in 60fps, went from 1070 to 3070, the graphics is amazing, gameplay reminds me of borderlands and mostly the nudity, ive never tabbed out fast in my life until this game, my mom went to my room and asked why i was holding a robotic naked female. it was the hardest question to answer. anyways 10/10 on everything"
1610064098,Story is great if you can get past the MANY bugs
1610063973,"Is it perfect?
Nope.

What it is...
Very good story driven game
Full of very well written side quests
Fun combat
Looks great minus some animation hicups now and then
Cyberpunk

What its not..
A free form RPG ala New Vegas
Game of your life
GTA with scifi sprinkled on top
Worse game ever made


TBH the console players have legit gripes. PC players have nothing much to complain about. I have far more issues running New Vegas than this. Skyrim/Oblivion have just as many, if not more bugs. GTA does as well, not to the degree of the Bethesda titles, but to pretend a game is bug free is stupid. The only issues I have had are animations. They are few and far between, and only bothered me a couple times. 

tldr.. If you have at least an rtx2080 and like story driven games with great side quests buy it.
If you are turned into the Hulk from a single issue... have fun finding anything that meets that standard."
1610063795,I like the game yes mby have some bugs but overall its good :)
1610063486,yes. very nice. 35 hours on the benis slider. 10/10.

9.5/10 from me.

1610063399,"Amazing game, enjoyed the hell out of it every second"
1610063315,"Played it, loved it. 

10/10"
1610063275,gasng
1610063230,Incomplete.
1610063154,"I've enjoyed the hell out of this Cyberpunk. It has it faults, plenty of graphic glitches, AI is a little wonky at times but I've loved playing it."
1610063140,fun
1610062795,"Yes, there are bugs and they will be fixed. I played through the game on a mediocre specs system and even though the game crashed every hour or so, the autosaves were mostly on point and I could continue with minimal time loss.

I just have one more mission to play and I can say I enjoyed the game greatly and will play through it at least one more time."
1610062680,amazing
1610062640,"Whilst it does have some issues it's a fair enough shooter that can be played in multiple ways that lead to enough gameplay differences you can get a few fairly unique runs out of it. (at least in terms of how you go about playing the game) The main story is fairly short and decisions have little impact on the actual outcomes (kind of like Mass Effect 3's endings) but there is plenty of side missions and side activities to extend the play duration though doing them can become potentially repetitive. All in all it's a decent enough game that didn't live up to the over expectations that were set for it by pretty much everybody and it likely needed some more time in development than it had, but given the attitude towards delay that wasn't really an option. The game isn't THAT flawed, has enough to do to get some decent game time out of it and depending on your specs it looks nice."
1610062623,"Ehh......fun if you like gta type games. but not really revolutionary like it was advertised. ai system is terrible. played on very hard....nothing hard about it. 

over hyped, lots of bugs, just overall let down. Over promised, under delivered, seems like there's a lot of content that has been cut. Would wait until the game is fixed, or on sale. not worth full price at the moment."
1610062574,"[h1] Don't buy just yet [/h1]

I bought the game at launch expecting something great, however I was disappointed. At launch the game ran bad even at low settings ( I have a gtx 1070). Barely hit 30 fps. Barely was using my CPU either. I had to mod the exe for the game to actually use the rest of my cpu.  However the recent patches fixed those issues somewhat. There's still quite a few immersion breaking bugs and even game breaking bugs. Sometimes my character wouldn't be able to equip a weapon during combat. Sometimes V would just get stuck in place and I'd have to reload. Item overlays sometimes stay even when I picked up the item. The cars in the distance especially in the badlands are just 2d sprites that continue to cycle. If you stop your car in the middle of the streets cars just stop and traffic builds up. The NPC AI could use some more work. If I fire a gun in the sky they all cower rather than running. If I'm doing a gig and I have to fight people, the npcs outside of the building are just cowered in place after I leave the mission area. If I start a car and an NPC is too close they just jump like I was trying to hit them. The wanted system in the game makes police instantly spawn where you're at. You could be doing an assault side mission and accidentally hit a civilian in the crossfire, suddenly a cop appears out of nowhere and starts shooting you, not the perps who were going to kill the person anyway. You could walk by the police the wrong way and suddenly they're after you. The phone calls feel intrusive at times. I could be doing an interesting side quest then suddenly a fixer calls while I'm already in dialogue. The side quests get stale after a while. Also, why does buying a car have to be a side quest? [spoiler] Most of the major side quests and character arcs center around revenge.  I don't mind a revenge story but when it's with every character it gets boring.  I don't mind a revenge story but when it's with every character it gets boring. [/spoiler] . The rpg elements are alright but not as good as it was made out to be. New vegas still does the roleplaying side of things way better than most modern rpg games. The main story feels short but i liked it. I still found myself attached to certain characters in the main story because their writing was well done. Your lifepaths dont mean much other than special dialogue options. And your dialogue options also don't have a huge impact on the game. [spoiler] Silverhand's side quests were among one of my favorites to play through. The cyberpsycho gigs were also fun. [/spoiler] I enjoy this game quite a bit and honestly wish it would have been better. Some areas feel unfinished as well. Me as the consumer shouldn't have to modify game files to fix the game and its issues. The game feels like an early access title at times.
Currently the devs are planning on releasing more major patches to the game in the coming months. But I feel like the game should have been finished from the start, even if it meant delays. Shame on me for giving the game a shot I guess. I don't recommend anyone buy it just yet. Give it a few more months before shelling out 60$."
1610062548,"Despite the bugs, this plays very nice and I love the story. Granted I'm working with an RTX 3090 but before upgrading I ran it on medium at a solid 50fps on a 1070ti. Tweak the settings as much as you can to suit your hardware and if you tweak properly you should be fine in the majority of areas. Bugs for me have included some graphical and clipping issues with first person animations as well as some NPC buggyness. I haven't encountered any mission breaking bugs but if I find any as i continue to play i'll update it here. Overall i recommend experiencing night city at least once and giving CDPR developers a chance to catch up because they were forced to push out this game half baked."
1610062204,Breathtaking
1610061983,"Love this game :) grate story and graphics. have only seen minor visual bugs, then again i have a pretty beefed up PC."
1610061932,"6/10

Loads of missing content with various bugs. Would probably recommend if the game goes on sale. ABSOLUTELY not worth the $60 price tag."
1610061776,"Glitchy, but worth playing. The story and setting combine most of your favorite pop culture and science fiction references with a gritty backdrop akin to the wild west."
1610061706,"I just can't recommend it. It felt linear. Almost generic. Nothing really matters. All in all I was disappointed quite often. The Hype Train derailed, and CDPRs marketing strategies surely didn't help."
1610061399,"A lot has been said about the bugs in this game, and yes it has a lot of bugs, but mostly dumb graphical ones that don't spoil the game and are actually very funny. The AI is also not that hot, the police will chase you on foot for a block and then give up, so just get a car and drive 2 blocks and you are safe. There are many things like this that needs work and I am sure they will improve on them. But this game is really a lot of fun, exploring and finding new things, so many missions, I have almost played 100 hours at the time of writing this and I haven't finished the game yet. I do plan on finishing it soon, I am on the last mission, but I am trying not to do it until I really have to. But I am running out of side missions to do. This game is crying out for multiple play throughs too. The best thing about it is the look though. The ""cyberpunk"" style. Now I am lucky enough to be able to play this on 4K with all the graphics turned up to max and with all the ray tracing goodness thrown in too. It is the best looking game I have ever played. The story is also amazing too, each mission is fun, but the main story is really great and heartbreaking at times. I know there are multiple endings to this and I will try to see them all. If you have the money and the machine to play this on high settings, then this game is a must. But even if you don't and have one of the new consoles, it is also going to look great on that too. If you have an old console, I wouldn't bother though, a lot has been said about that. 9/10 game for me!!!"
1610061226,its trash
1610061119,"I am thoroughly enjoying this game.

That being said, I'm disappointed with how little narrative content there is. The game is over 90% side-quest. That's not good. It should be 90% story and 10% side-quest."
1610060699,"Cyberpunk is a beautiful immersive wonder. It offers many many hours of gameplay. The one caveat is I likely did not have many issues with performance due to my rig being brand new (GPU GTX 3070 CPU 5600x) 

There are some bugs that I have encountered Graphics loading incorrect assets (at one point I put what looked like a gun inside a computer chip slot intstead of a computer chip) and I have encountered flashes of T poses while driving.

That said those things arent that damning for me. I have 150 hours into the game and would recommend it for anyone with a very new computer."
1610060589,"This game is really really good. But it is buggy as hell. If you can look past bugs and got a solid system to run this beast of a game, I highly recommend it."
1610060322,cool
1610060306,good good
1610060241,Class
1610060189,Yes this game has had problems and still does. I do like the game though. It's good. At least on PC and with my luck I have had little issues. That said I have encountered plenty of bugs. Mostly small but some big were I had to load a previous save etc. I was going to give a thumbs down and change it once patches roll in. But I am going to start off positive and change this review to negative in a few months if it seems like CDPROJECT RED has abandoned this game. Which I am 99% sure they won't.
1610060014,"If u like rpg then , that is right game for u  . Very nice graphics , decent  story , very interesting side missions , many playstyle choices via skill trees  but  ( Do NOT MESS WITH WITH ATTRIBUTE POINTS ) . Personally cant wait until dlc comes out . Highly recommended !"
1610059977,"just a great game in all
"
1610059966,This game is amazing. Still a few buggy things here and there. But overall its really good.
1610064713,"My thoughts on the game, having completed the story and played it for around 90 hours at the time of writing, starting off with the bad stuff and ending with the good and why I'd still recommend it.

[h1]The BAD[/h1]

Lack of proper ultrawide support. I run the game at 3440x1440 and while everything in the game itself works, its menus don't. Open any menu and you'll have two large black blocks of nothingness left and right. This also breaks the breaching tutorial and, most importantly, part of the photo mode by having selectable options and/or text in a screen space not viewable and/or not accessible by your mouse cursor. Sometimes after reloading a save, those black barriers are also remaining in the game itself. The only solution? Open and close any menu. Ridiculous.

The open world NPC AI (on foot) is rudimentary, at best. Its reaction to you causing havoc is either a) run away or - what you'll see mostly - b) cower on the spot. For all eternity. Immersion breaking.

The open world driving AI is barely working. While traffic itself works somehow, you'll still often encounter cars standing in the middle of the road, doing nothing. They also cannot circumvent obstacles and frequently ignore red lights, so you'll end up in traffic jams alot because some AI routine stopped working and the cars behind have no way to navigate around it. In the story you end up on the passenger seat a few times and it's absolutely noticeable that the AI is being guided ""on rails"", sometimes plowing through cars in the way or taking turns that are physically impossible.

The open world police/chase AI is nonexistent. Cops cannot chase you but literally spawn somewhere around you, sometimes emerging out of thin air right in front of you. Accidentally driven over 2 pedestrians and now you're wanted? No sweat, just drive 300m further and your wanted-status disappears. They won't chase you because they simply can't. Given that this isn't a small indie project but had millions in development and years of time, this is nothing short but ridiculous.

The crafting and upgrade systems are largely useless. You'll find weapons and armor that are better almost on every mission, the hassle of deconstructing items and using the raw materials to craft better gear just isn't worth it. The only exception being to get money quick, because you can always buy a can of soda, disassemble it and sell the components for far more than what you paid initially. Again, ridiculous and a mystery how this made it into the release version.

[h1]The MEH[/h1]
The RPG systems are weak. Dumping all points into a specific tree doesn't have a very large impact. I'm okay with this, though, since this doesnt penalize you too much when some time into your playthrough you may decide to pick up melee weapons instead of ranged. Gives the player freedom of choice and I'm totally fine with that.

I had to reload a save maybe 5-6 times in total during the whole playthrough because the quest triggers were ""stuck"", meaning starting the next dialogue or playing a scripted sequence didn't work. This happened only on side missions, mind you. I don't mind that since the game autosaves very frequently and often doesn't take away control from the player. You're able to goof around the room and loot everything not bolted to the ground while NPCs are talking to you and I always appreciate games that let met do that. I'm not mad if this may break a quest every so often.

[h1]The GOOD[/h1]
The story had me engaged, was very well written and I enjoyed it very much. Apart fromt he main story, the side missions involving separate quest lines around certain characters were also on point and delivered. Even some tertiary missions had me engaged or thinking. Absolutely no complaints here, I'd love to have played for 90 more hours with the means of storytelling CD Project Red came at me with.

The character design and writing was top notch. Also the 3D modeling, textures and animations easily set a new standard,  the characters were almost uncannily well animated. During dialogue you'll often - and ever so subtle - see the reactions to what you say on their faces before they actually begin to talk. CD Project Red really displayed their prowess here, a step up from the already well crafted characters of their previous game, The Witcher 3.

AND FINALLY.......
The open world. Night City itself. It absolutely shows that most of the development time went into creating this city.
Yes, there are other developers who create larger open worlds. And yes, they're engaging too. But when it comes to ONE single city (and some surrounding desert), nothing even comes close. In the first 30 hours it frequently occurred that I was driving somewhere and immediately slammed the brakes in order to marvel at the sights and screenshot the living hell out of the game, fully expecting to walk around a corner and be greeted with a wall and instead seeing even more sprawling details and verticality, making the initial reason why I've stopped almost seem boring in comparison. 

Other times I just walked through the city aimlessly, completely enamored. It's immersive in a way that I not only got lost exploring, but I WANTED to in the first place.
Take the lightning for example. On a large scale, you'll have sundawns, midday and sunsets that paint every street, every corner, every back alley in a vastly different mood. And when it's getting dark the city really shines and emits a completely different vibe than during the day. An endless sea of myriads of different lights, different sounds and indistinctive noises all deliberately put there in order to mix together and create the impression that you're walking through an actual megacity.

It really shows that the level designers and graphic artists were given free reign and allowed to go absolutely nuts. Even the smaller set pieces, such as locations for side missions, are like carefully crafted miniature levels, making you forget that there is this huge open world still waiting outside. Every light source carefully placed to set the mood or highlight something specific, every interior crafted with an obsession for details that borders on over-engineering. Even some far off locations that don't take part in any story events and are most likely never seen by the majority of players are crafted with an unheard of level of detail. It's a lavish world. But, as some pointed out, there are not many ways to interact with it. Treat it like a diorama of what a city in the future might look like. 

All controversies, bugs, rushed development and cut content aside: What CDPR created with Night City is a testament to video games being an art form. With commitment, love and dedication they've created an absolute masterpiece in setting and worldbuilding, 
If you have a remote interest in the cyberpunk/neofuture theme and/or you've watched movies like Bladerunner (both old and new), Ghost In The Shell, The Fifth Element,....hell, even Robocop and Judge Dredd (the 90s one with Stallone) and thought to yourself: Hey, it'd be cool to walk around in that world: Go press ""Add to Cart"" already.

If you're hesitating whether the game is worth your euro/dollars in its current form: Wait. But at some point in the future, maybe during a heavily discounted sale: Buy it and start it up, only if it is to appreciate Night City. It deserves to be seen. It deserves to be praised. It also deserves to be in a state that a larger audience will praise it.

For me, games are not only art but first and foremost entertainment. Was I entertained playing it and thus recommend it? ABSOLUTELY!

1610059747,"One of the best games I've ever played, the bugs have not affected my gameplay (RTX 2060), couldn't recommend enough if your system can run it."
1610059693,Love the bugs and glitches
1610059559,"Addictive story, love the game!"
1610059292,"Fantastic Game!

I purchased this game pre-launch and have had almost no problems with it, despite reading about them everywhere.  Even before the first patch I wasn't running into all the headaches I hear people comment on.  Maybe because my system is beefier, but its ran great for me.

There are two glitches I run into.  

The first is that once and a while I can't pick up dropped loot or loot off a body.  While somewhat annoying this is far from a game breaking.  And luckily, this has only happened with common and uncommon drops for me (white and green).

The second bug I've experienced is a trigger never happened for a quest and I had to load a previous save.  The second time the trigger happened.  This has only happened to me one time on one quest.

All in all an excellent gem of a game!  Best game of 2020 by far and I highly recommend it if you enjoy the cyberpunk genre or RPG's."
1610059170,"Great game with good story's trueout it. Now many ppl are not happy with the bugs and the missing content there was some talk about blabla i get it quit a few things are buggy but i would say most of the time you are looking at the bugs and laughing because of how stupid it looks ect and the game on PC is not that badly broken as it is on console and even if some content was cut the game still has many things for you to do. Now what you need to remmber when playing this is, it is a RPG game single player and the most importen thing in a game like that is the story and exploration of the world you are in be it the people you meet or the things you see/do. It is not a MMO or Endless game where you just keep on playing, It has a start and a finish like any other RPG which means that the game does not have a ton of endgame content or a shit ton of customization as that is not what a RPG is about and some ppl seem to forget all about that. Not many RPG's if any really has that kinda stuff in them without the help of some mods from other people so keep that in mind so you know what you are getting yourself into. What this game does have is great story, lots of places to see and things to do, and most ppl that take the time and don't rush well easily find around 200 hours of gameplay. The game well get fixed as time go by making it even better and less buggy and do keep in mind most games now days get released in a buggy state because of the rush from the high ups and investors and not the people that was trying to make something great for us to play. So what are you waiting for? if RPGs are your thing then go ahead and buy the game it well be worth your money and time."
1610059088,Fix your game bros
1610059035,tem uns revolver eletronico ai
1610058638,"its okay. just okay. worth a playthrough, maybe wait till its not so buggy"
1610058478,"I spent 250 hours in this game so far. I really enjoy my time in it. Is this a very buggy game? Surely it is, but most of the bugs are not critical, at least on PC, there's nothing save and load can't solve. Some of the bugs are hilarious, like the T-shape pose bug when driving. Me and my wife had a good laugh first time seeing it. I believe this is a master piece to be, as long as they fix the bugs overtime, and I think they will.

CDPR did a fantastic job building this immersive dark cyberpunk future to be so believable. With RTX lighting, the graph is astounding, atmosphere is so real. Characters building and their voice acting are just fantastic, at some point you almost forgot these are not real people you are talking to. The dialogue lines are also wonderful, made some good laughs over the humor. The emotional ride with the story line is amazing. The game play is fun, there are different fighting styles you can pick, just in later game play, sometime you feel you are too powerful and there's little challenge when fighting even the most dangerous street gangs you can find on the map. The choices you make will affect what happen next, but overall it's still a fairly linear story line. I wish there's more freedom, but in the same time I understand the more freedom you have, the more content you need to create, but most of players will only touch a small portion of the game. I think they made a good balance. I can't wait for the DLC and more content to be added in the future."
1610058185,This game is fun but a lot to take in until you take your time and figure our what you want to do. So many choices :Dp
1610058109,"fun to run around and upgrade your items, it do be buggy doe"
1610058062,buggy but great.
1610057885,"CD Project Red should be ashamed for releasing a game that by all accounts should have been delayed AGAIN by at least another six months to a YEAR!  Way to many bugs and just plain F-UP'ED mission issues that don't allow you to complete the core game! Not to mention that the game is so poorly optimized you have to have a beefy GPU just to play it some what properly and even then cars crash arbitrarily on their own, Npc's just stand there stuck in a cross position and now another annoying bug has presented itself! Cracking damon codes on various wall units have stopped producing ED's. (money). Shooting is fine but repetitive and boring some of the time, many missions are  good while many others are put there just to give the impression of value.

Overall Cyber Punk 2077 as a next generation game just doesn't deliver as of yet.. the city design and all the different places lights and turns is the only saving grace right now in my opinion to purchase this title.  I think the majority of the eight year development cycle was used to develop it's complexity and it is truly stunning for a video game and it's only saving grace for now.

Wait at least another 6 months to purchase, CD Project Red should have at least two more updates by that 
 time hopefully the development team can fix more bugs and the overall presentation of Cyber Punk but right now I can't (with a clean conscience) recommend this game especially after being in development for eight years.. Just inexcusable.."
1610057866,"Have encountered quite a few bugs, but the gameplay and storytelling are very nice."
1610057731,just terrible rpg don't waste the $
1610057563,"Game is fun... I like riding my motorbike around listening to the techno radio station. 
Also I like chopping people with knives and samurai swords.
I had a glitch here or there, but nothing that spoiled the play.
8/10"
1610057474,The only problem is i haven't seen a single guitar yet.
1610057049,"It is not without faults, but I've still really enjoyed it. If you've waited until now though it might be worthwhile to wait until some more updates are rolled out and it drops in price."
1610056995,FUN GAME. cant wait till the glitches are gone.
1610056934,"Aside from the all the bugs, the game itself is really boring and the game design is just not good"
1610056875,Can pet bald cats 10/10
1610056595,Very nice.
1610056575,Very nice
1610056507,"It is a good game? Yes
It lived up to the hype? No 

As ironic as it sound this game need more time developing. Simple things as being able to change your hair ou general apparence mid-game is not possible, and this is pretty weird in a world where people change body parts as i change my toothbrush. Plot is good, just not great. Few NPCs make this game feel like a step down from games like witcher 3, it really seems that the time spent by the developers was used for work on the game's visuals alone. 

Perfomance wise, it is ok. It is a very demanding game but it is not broken, i'm sure you can play in your rig if you spend some time in the settings to reach your sweet spot. 

I'm giving a thumbs up but i don't recommend picking this up other than in a sale, if the developers decides to transform  this game in the masterpiece they were promising us, maybe i change this recommendation"
1610056489,Took me roughly 30 hours to complete the story. with 3 primary character paths that means I can replay it 2 more times with different experiences. 90 hours of entertainment for $60? well worth it in terms of how I value money on games. Was a very immersive experience and graphics were outstanding on my PC. Granted not many people have top of the line RTX builds so that graphical amazement may not exist for those people. But if you do have a good PC build....get this game. You will not regret it.
1610056389,"unfinished, with glitches, still one of the most enjoyable and most played games i have ever played."
1610056205,"This is one of the most awesome plays, that if done with bugs and all."
1610056182,"Not the best open world game out there, but if plot and atmosphere are what you're looking for then jump on in."
1610056169,"This game is about the world and its characters, and it knocks it out of the park. It's dialogue heavy, slow at times, and not exactly what I expected, but I haven't felt so immersed and connected with a game's world before. I just can't pull myself out of Night City. Really something special, and I can't wait to see how it improves over the next few years."
1610056087,"Overall, it is a masterpeace"
1610056012,"It is pretty annoying how all the side quests, gigs and secondary missions around the map are not well developed. I have found myself to be stuck in a quest because the door simply won't open and I have to load the game a checkpoint before it and do everything again and hope for the side quest to not bug again.
There are sooo many details in the main story but all of the side quests were made and not polished at all.
I like the fact that you have a LOT of stuff to do in this game and I am talking about 50-70 side quests you can do. But driving or going to different places makes you realize how the city was probably fully developed and I am sure they had other ideas with the nomads/adelcados but they left it as a desert. There are barely houses there, it's all plain and it needs work.
Fast travelling was rushed. They textured a train station that it's not even developed it is only there, incomplete.
AND MUCH MORE INCOMPLETE STUFF, OUTSIDE OF THE MAIN STORY.

The main story is awesome, it is great but everything else needed at least 2 more years to be fully developed AND polished."
1610055978,"Fantastic CDPR game. The amount of attention put into the world-building, characters, writing, skill trees, and gameplay is something to be recognized. Obviously, there's optimizations and bug-fixing that needs to happen - but the state of the game on PC is similar to any other AAA title launch these days (which isn't an excuse, I'm just used to it by now). Console performance is truly abysmal and shouldn't have launched, they should've delayed consoles entirely.

I played through the entire story and finished all the side-quests before writing this (about 80 hrs of playtime). I have yet to go through and play the other two starting stories, and play through all the skills within each skill tree, but that's just a testament to how much content there is, and what all you can do in this game on each playthrough.

My first playthrough was with female V as a Street Thug. I've gotten a few hours now into a male V as a Corpo agent, and already I'm making new choices within dialogue and getting a whole new story already. I know later quests and side-quests will be pretty similar, but each one has a different outcome and leads to further different outcomes. There's so much replayability here.

Unfortunately, replayablility is all the game has once you beat it. Once you hit endgame and do all the quests and side-quests, there isn't much content at all to do. Hopefully future DLC and multiplayer content will add things to the endgame other than restarting, or maybe they'll make a NG+ mode."
1610055962,"The Cyberpunk world and map design is top tier and at times very immersive, however the game really does run poorly on older specced pc's and there are some absolutely immersion breaking game bugs and quirks especially in some mission NPC's , there are some really cool moments that are tarnished by this.

that being said it is still a solid purchase and very fun game with so many ways to play with weapons/builds.
I do recommend this game however if you are on a lower end PC or on the fence i would wait until the summer for CDPR to release free DLC and patches to bring the game up to their standards for their vision of the game.

fyi, 100 hours game time = 100% completion for me with only a bit of fucking around with photo mode inbetween so can get your monies worth out of it."
1610055603,"Good game overall, amazing side quests. But the amount of content was a let down, only be able to barely squeeze out 46. Lots of annoying bugs, but most were fixed."
1610055417,"Aslong as youre playing on PC youre all good. felt short, ending made me sad."
1610055391,"I played this game for a long time and i still didnt finished it 100%. 
First of all you need to know one thing that the game is progressing 7 years, but they started working on story mode at 2018. Before that there was only probably Night City and everyone's Story Line until you meet Johny Silverhand. 
This game has a lot of bugs, but this is CD PROJEKT RED. They fixed fully bugged The Witcher 3, everyone who played they will know it.
This is the game where you making your own path and every choice you make in game it decides your Ending. 
Side Jobs in game are most imortant thing.
Game is buggy, but thats not reason to hate it even if they delayed it too much.
Physics and water things i am sure that they will fix it in next patches. January Patch improved game alot and February Patch is upcoming.
Game requires very good PC, mid-range PC-s wont run this at 60 fps. I Hope that they will patch it to everyone can play this game normaly.

My Raitings:

Freemode: 7/10 (I gave this cuz you cant do romances with Story characters after Job is finished)
Storymode: 10/10 (Masterpiece, defenetly Breathtaking game)
Graphics Quality: 10/10 (You feel like you are in movie, even if i played it on medium)
Night City: 10/10 (Very satisfied with city look)
Character Customization: 9.5/10
Voice Actings: 10/10 (Voice lines are so good)
Game Optimization: 5/10 (Need to be honest, this rly requires expensive PC)
Soundtrack: 10/10 (Best Soundtrack i ever heard)


Note: These Raitings only is valid for PC Copy."
1610055256,Good game.
1610067195,"Digital dog shit is an apt way to describe this pile of trash. Broken, buggy, unfinished, with a world this is so devoid of life and things to do even a 12+ yr old game like GTA 4 shits all over this next gen title. 8+ yrs of development and this is the best they could give us? I can only hope that half if not more of the dev team is fired after this hot garbage of a release. I could understand if the game was rushed to market, but for fuck sake after 8yrs of working on this title if this is the best they could do, I think its time to re-evaluate the career path they have taken. Don't waste your money on this game, its not worth a dime. Plenty of other games on steam that are more deserving of your time and cash made by developers who did not ride the short bus everyday to school. FUCK THIS GAME, FUCK CDPR. 

Lets run down all the shit that is a complete fuck fest in this pile O shit. starting with the god aweful AI. Its A for ass and  I for I dont know because there is no intelligence to be had in any of the NPC or enemies. Devs where so top notch they could not figure out how to program police so they just stand around on streets circle jerking each other, if you are wanted they will spawn in behind you no matter where you are. No driving was programmed for them so they will never case you in a car enjoy getting away easy as pie. Your life choice at the start of the game has as much meaning as the morning turd you flushed after breakfast. You have one romance option per gender depending on your sexuality. Want to be gay you have one choice in the entire game. There are less than 20 weapon models in the entire game, Hope they did not over tax themselves with all the Unique and Awesome models (heavy sarcasm). Expect to have a fuck tone of the same exact gun in your inventory after clearing out a stronghold of enemies. the only thing that changes is the sheet dps and stats, even the legendary guns look the exact same as the commons of the same type. with nothing additional except for extra mod slots and higher sheet stats, HOW FUCKING EXCITING. this is the same for legendary clothing which again does nothing different from all the other rarities.  Driving in this game has got to be some of the worst in any game ever. NES games from the 80's had better handling vehicles. Every car handles like you are driving on fucking ice. Apparently the tards, I mean devs have not heard of the concepts of traction. Every person on the Cyperpuke team from the lead dev down to the weekend intern should be absolutely EMBARRASSED by the work they have shown in this ""Finale Product"". 

8 yrs in development and this hunk of shit is what we got. EA, Activision, and Ubisoft release some shit games, but at least the games are shit because they were developed in a short amount of time and rushed to market. I can understand that mgmt at CDPR probably show how shit this game was and said well if in 8yrs this is the garbage our team has than we have two choices pull the plug on the whole thing and take the loss or release the pile of shit and maybe recoup some of the cash. Gaming in 2020/2021 where a game this trash can have mostly positive reviews? FML

One good thing, at least on my rig the game has not crashed once so there is that."
1610055219,great game will only get better with patches
1610055105, This game has brought so many emotions to me the story is great and the endings are even better i absolutely recommend this game
1610054924,"After 100 hours on the game, ultimately I cannot recommend this game.

There is a lot to like, the visuals are great, there is a nice progression and character levelling system, and combat is fun (if unchallenging). I personally felt it was well voice acted, and the story is pretty good too.

However, as a youtube reviewer put it, there is no interactivity in the world, the AI is really dumb (like really dumb, stealth is no challenge, fighting is no challenge, no interaction/ dialogue with random NPCs) and doesn't interact with V in any meaningful way. This breaks immersion in the (very cool) world. There is no reputation system, or anything that interacts with V as he/she gets stronger and completes harder missions. For me, this is the main issue with the game. Bugs can be fixed (eventually), but the core gameplay and underlying mechanics cannot really. Cyberpunk is nice to look at, but there really isn't that much depth to it imo. 

Anyway that's my two cents, if you are going to pick it up, wait for six months until it is steeply marked down in a sale and the devs have had more time to fix the very many bugs present."
1610054824,"Sweet game, too many negative reviews, play if and be your own judge.. just make sure your hardware is up to par."
1610054811,nice
1610054660,Runs like trash on a GTX 3080
1610054600,"Games actually fun when you don't have retards saying its glitchy. Have only had two glitches occur in total, both resolved themselves after letting an enemy kill me. (both glitches are already patched)"
1610054532,"If you liked The Witcher 3 then you'll like this. Excels in story, characters and atmosphere."
1610054586,"Lets go over the Pros first in Cyberpunk 2077,

The game is a open world rpg from Cd Projekt Red, The game has a great story, great voice actors and the character customization is awesome, there's so many choices you can do to make the game tailor to your play style, its how you want to play, the game has so much inventory customization as well as cyber customization to really make your character pop, you can rush the story or you can take your time in this wonderful world. 

The negatives,


first let me start off by saying you might want to wait before picking up a copy the game is unoptimized, i've personally dealt with crashing, low fps as well as huuuuge fps drops, i'll be playing at a good constant 60 then i enter a single area and boom im at 30, on a rtx 2080 super 32 gigs of ram as well as a amd ryzen 7 i think, the bugs are insane some are laughable some are straight game breaking like some save file corruptions crashing, fps drops, Now I believe with due time the devs will get all this situated and the game will be like a new skyrim or witcher 3, 


my final verdict. If you like games like fallout, skyrim, witcher, this game is for you the story is great, the combat is cool, and the amount of choices you can make is awesome the only thing holding down this game is the unoptimization as well as the many bugs you will encounter. This game has the potential to reach a 10/10 game of the year, the devs just need to do some fixes and optimizations and they will most likely reach a 10/10.


8.5/10 till further notice.... Once this game gets fixed and has way less bugs I may raise it to 9.5/10"
1610054429,People are just overreacting. Yes there are bugs here and there but i play hours on end and barely get them and when i do get them they aren't game breaking. Lack of side quests tho and the story line could be 4x longer. Makes you wonder what they did all these years. I love the game and waited a very long time to play it. Can't believe i could complete the story line in a single day (main quest line on normal). So far i've been skipping the last mission and been doing every single side quest possible before i do because multiple endings. And after you did that quest it basically puts you back in time to continue to play the game. So it makes more sense to me storywise to first do everything. Also so far i've noticed only a couple side quest lines and mainly the ones you can start a romance have an effect on the ending. All the other side quests are basically done in 5 minutes the objective is mostly 20 meters away from you and it's just one objective. So far i know there are only 80 side quests not gigs so quite a dissapointment on that. Still love the game. Also you can't adjust your character and change anything to appearence next to clothing and such. You also can't reset traits/perks so think twice before spending them!
1610054352,"Unoptimized to hell with plenty of bugs and graphical glitches, but I'd be lying if I said the writing wasn't up to snuff. Love me some good written stories. Openworld is bland besides the buildings/surroundings, combat is ok, stealth is boring as hell to me, and I can't find a reason to use it honestly. The only thing that keeps me hooked is the characters, lore, and story. I'd wait to get it on sale for around $30 or most likely less as CDP usually do deep sales on their games."
1610054347,"It's not worth the 60€. The AI is on the level of Lego Island 2 which I played 20 years ago and while the city is nice to look at, it gets old fast when there is nothing really interesting you can do besides doing the quests"
1610054302,Nova.
1610054271,"Playing on a low end PC here and really enjoying it despite somewhat regular crashing. I play games primarily for the story and I have treated all of the GTA aspects of this game as window dressing. In doing so they are not a problem for me. I think anyone that is a fan of immersive sims and plays primarily for the story will have a great time with Cyberpunk as long as you are playing on PC.

The hate has been incredible for this game and from the console side I would say is fully justified. However if your on PC, the only real problems are expectations (some promised which should not have been) versus reality. Developers making silly promises is nothing new, Peter Molyneux was doing this 25 years ago at Bullfrog. If the developers wont do it, you have to reign your expectations in yourself.

I really hope the lawsuits do not end CD Projekt Red. Despite there stupid promises I do not want to see them go under. The artists and programmers, the makers of the Witcher series and all of the free DLC they provided deserve better than that. Hopefully the developers can get through the lawsuits and add some of the promised features as free DLC over the coming year."
1610054053,"Not a bad game, it collapsed under the weight of its own hype.  That said, I would probably play more if I had access to hardware that can run it.  A gtx 1080 and ryzen 2700 just doesn't cut it.  System struggles to maintain 50fps with everything turned down at 1080p"
1610054014,"Overall it's a great game.  Atmosphere of a dystopic future city is reflected perfect. Side missions and characters are very gripping, however, I cant say the same for the main story. I think its very short and shallow. I was expecting more."
1610054013,"Cyberpunk 2077 on its own is a wonderful game with an amazing story that touched me throughout. I got emotionally attached to V, with her relationships with the characters in the game. Animations and cutscenes were powerful. Gameplay (I love mantis blades the most) is great, gunplay is a little clunky and the game overall could use more interactions with the world. Add that and it will become more immersive. 
I give it an 8/10; I think being fully immersed is very important when it comes to such a large city and a RPG. Should allow more customization + being able to customize again later.
Didn’t run into that many bugs, only a few. Waiting for ending DLCs and online Cyberpunk!"
1610053867,Apart from some bugs it's very fun to play
1610053811,"panam is hot,, buy now"
1610053625,Amazing.
1610053550,"Finished everything in the game, and for 60 bux I would certainly recommend playing it on PC, but there are definitely a lot of ""interesting glitches"", though none completely broke my game or ruined the experience. On ultra graphics, the game looks amazing on my 2080ti ftw3 with i7 8700k, and this was the best part seeing the characters / stories develop in high definition."
1610053312,"Floppin like fish. 
6/10
Definitely needed at least another year in the oven, between content that seems rushed, missing, unfinished and more bugs than a Bethesda title, this is a hard game to recommend in its current state. 
The open world aspect of the game feels like a lazy half baked effort. It was initially fun to explore the city, but that was quite fleeting. There isn't much too it, and what is there is not that great. 
THAT BEING SAID, the main story is a helluva lot of fun and really well done. Mostly. The soundtrack is outstanding and visually (when the game isn't glitching all over the place) stunning. 
I really feel it should have been more linear, but ah well. There is a lot of promise here but it will take a lot of work.. Hopefully they are able to pull it off.
Don't buy the game right now, wait a bit and see if they fix it."

1610053193,"Although the game has it's bugs., the pc version is actually reall good and includes a really good and immersive story mode. I would 100% recommend!"
1610053088,Boohoo. There's bugs. Game is fun as shit.
1610097538,"I should just clarify by saying I was never on the hype for this game whatsoever, I very much got it on a whim the day of its release just to see what all the fuss was about...and oh boy was there fuss about it. Cyberpunk 2077 boasted about being the next generation of open world games/RPGs but during my +30 hour playthrough, it very much proved to be stuck with the times boasting several exhausted mechanics we have seen over numerous other releases in the past decade.

I could beat the dead horse over your head and tell you what a lot of other critics and folks have said about the very unpolished release (which begs the question of what you were having your devs do for several years) or I could break it down to its core and tell you that Cyberpunk really isn't anything special or anything you haven't probably played in the last few years or so. There is fun to be had sure, but with that fun is the frustration of the game breaking under its own weight every 12 seconds and being so demanding that even newer hardware trembles at the very thought of playing this game in a stable state. Initially, finding bugs was a funny pass time that happened out of nowhere and gave me a genuine laugh, but as the game dragged on and I got further and further into the 10 digit hours it was just a bleak reminder of so many things wrong with this games development (I counted several times I have had to reload a save because I either softlocked the game or an event just wouldn't occur when it was supposed to). If you're looking to this game for story rich content...I guess its certainly delivers there at times but it might not be the satisfying payoff you're hoping it will be in the end. At the very least when I was avoiding the story I found myself getting more enjoyment out of the quests and side characters for hours though this experience was also slightly dampened by a few anticlimactic endings for them.

I would not recommend this game in its current state, its a mess of poor optimization and plethora of glitches that really dampen the experience all wrapped in what could be a slightly above average RPG that gives its higher moments but only in short bursts."
1610053013,"despite all the hate this game has gotten in the short time after its release enjoy it, actually"
1610052968,"Game had bugs, but the game itself was amazing. Good story, good characters, good gameplay. Tons of content here for multiple playthroughs. You can be mad about bugs, but dont get tricked into thinking this game is garbage. Once the bugs and issues are fixed, this is easily GOTY material."
1610052894,"It's great fun. And works with no problems on my Asus Zephyrus G14 with AMD Ryzen 7 w/8 cores, 16 GB RAM, and GeForce GTX 1660 Ti graphics with 8MB. But....always looking forward to updates that I've read to be coming down the pipe. Including specifically a reboot in June."
1610053042,"Technical issues aside, the game itself is just kind of dated. 

Overhyped into the idea this would be the next big thing in gaming, Cyberpunk2077 actually feels like a game just taking the best things of games from the 2010's and failing to make them feel new again.
It's a decent game, it just isn't anything innovative. It may be the best way to experience a cyberpunk world, so there's that positive."
1610052435,"Bugs?... ✓
Glitches?... ✓
Save scumming to backtrack game ending bugs?... Oh hell yes.

Do I regret the purchase and time invested? No fucking way. It's got preem as story payoff."
1610052350,"I wish bugs was all i had to complain about.
Dont get me wrong, fk'n bugs everywhere.

But the reason i cant recommend is because this game flatly lacks the features it promised, it's a lie. 
the AI doesnt exist. Like, at all.
Cop AI is summarized as (spawn location = 5 feet behind player), 
the apt you start with is the only one available and there's no reason to visit. 
the loot system is totally bonkers and it seems like weapons are pure RNG and even their own dps calculations dont make sense. 
the city and people are wonderfully designed, horrifically implemented. exact doubles all over, if you shoot in the air and look away, and look back at an npc, they'll just dissapear. 
I hope this gets the ""no mans sky"" treatment and becomes a good game after some BIG updates. 
"
1610052258,"the story and the game play i excellent, the game is so good that i lose track of time when i play. The only reason i am not playing the game now is because my arm is in a cast."
1610052191,"The aesthetics of this game are second to none. 
The story, the characters, the music and the overall art design is simply phenomenal. There is nothing else like it.
This city looks spectacular, the characters look amazing, the cars are awesome, the retro clothes are dorky yet cool and the music is pumping!
The characters and story are really engaging and leave you wanting more.

But.....the bugs. The bugs, the bugs, the bugs.
There's is no denying it, this game is glitchy as hell. 
Yes it is fixable, but boy do they have a lot of work.
Version 1.06 did seem to iron out some of the major issues, but there are still plenty of annoying and consistent bugs.
I can't count the amount of times I've had to reload a save game because of a stuck subtitle or on screen message.

Technical issues aside one of the more disappointing things seems to be a real lack of polish in some aspects of the game, particularly the AI; they're dumb as hell. 
The city is full of people but they are all lifeless, soulless drones who fall over screaming if you get within 3 feet, and get stuck behind your car if you park in front of them and they can't seem to walk around. 
The traffic AI is also shocking, constantly crashing in to cars, barriers and anything in their way.

There's LOTS of small things that individually aren't bad, but collectively show a real lack of attention to detail. 
E.g. invincible tyres, car damage is disproportionate, the map is a mess, the mini-map doesn't zoom out when you speed up (so you always miss your turn when driving), and you can safely jump out of your car at 150mph and just casually continue walking at a brisk pace.... these are just a few of many examples.

CDPR also spent all this time developing a character creation screen, and yet most of the game is in first person.....
They give you a wang adjustment, and yet in game you still have shorts on when you unequip all your gear!?
Now I'm not actually interested in in-game wang, but what is the point? 
Why concentrate on all these novelties when it really adds nothing to the game, and there are so many more important aspects that need serious attention?

I think this was some serious mismanagement from CDPR.
This wasn't the developers fault, this was poor management, they've simply concentrated on the wrong things.
Rather than focusing on building a technically stable game with an engaging story and gameplay, it seems like they channelled their inner 12 year old and wrote ""character creation"", ""wang adjustment"", ""sex with hookers"" on a white board, and then built from there......

The game really needed at least another 1-2 years to iron out and polish everything.
I suspect they may have suffered from ""feature creep"" where management kept requesting new features before anything else was actually complete.
Anyone that has worked in corporate development knows this is par for the course, so I don't see why CDPR would be any different from any other company.

Despite all this criticism, most of this is fixable, and I do recommend you play this game. Whether that be now or in a year or so down the track, this really is something special.
It may take some time, but if No Mans Sky can go from trash to treasure, then this most definitely can too: and this has a hell of a better head start.
Make no mistake, there are huge volumes of people at CDPR that have done an incredible job, but unfortunately some mismanagement has well and truly stopped this game from becoming the G.O.A.T.
Maybe one day it will."
1610052164,Buggy but overall still a great great game
1610052067,Definitely worth waiting for the - ya know - full game...
1610052030,"enjoyable story, enjoyable gunplay. The npcs around the city will speak one line at you if you interact with them and then repeat the line over and over if you keep talking to them, woulda been cool if you could have random conversations with random npcs over the map and get offered side quests by them as well. Driving is pretty hard to get the hang of too haha."
1610051992,"So far, really enjoying the game, I started as a Nomad, and I've been playing through the game, doing all side quests before moving on to each story point, so I've been pretty thorough with my play through.

I've hit a few bugs such as:
1. Character T-Posing through the roof of the car while driving (sometimes)
2. 1 or 2 Characters have been T-Posing in the environment
3. An NPC got stuck in a lift and kept phasing in/out of existence, I just kept shooting him and he eventually died letting me continue
4. Some inventory tiles don't display their icons
5. Some phone calls talk over the NPC dialogue while in a mission (annoying as fuck)

Despite all of these issues, I've had a pretty good time so far, I've not had a single crash, nor has a mission been interrupted or impossible to finish because of these issues.

I'd recommend this game for sure, yes it has its flaws and it shouldn't have been released in this state, yet I'd still recommend this game due to the amount of fun I've been having thus far."
1610051769,"even with a good rig this shits unplayable , wont even launch after latest ""hotfix"" what a waste of potential , could have been way different .. 
empty world , zombie npcs , an amazing looking city of NOTHING 

i hope we all bought the early access version of this game and maybe in the future we will get delivered what we were promised , cant believe they actually launched a triple A title at this state 
"
1610051614,"Glitches here and there, but over all it is a blast to play."
1610051585,Play with a proper setup: the graphics are best I've ever seen. The story as side missons also are both captivating
1610051446,
1610051334,I would sign up to an EA Eula rather than buy this again.
1610051329,"This is a great game! I have had very few issues, all of them are not game breaking. Can't wait for DLC!"
1610051128,"Needs work but the game is good. An unpolished gem. I would wait for the 2 patches. 

7/10 would T-pose again"
1610051010,its great 10/10
1610050932,Amazing
1610050846,"Didn't live up to the hype but if you take it at face value it is still a fun game. Hopefully they continue to patch and add content to the game that was supposed to be there in the first place. Over 100 hours of playtime and I haven't experienced any game breaking bugs, just the stuff you've already seen with objects having bad collisions and textures not loading in correctly sometimes. Good story, decently fun gameplay. Just needed more time."
1610050797,I haven't played a game this much since the release week of Skyrim and I played that with no updates. I am at about 80 hours now with about half the stuff done. I drive everywhere and have been taking my time with main quest. It will for sure have Destiny 2 and Fallout NV beat for most time played by the time I am actually done with it.
1610050642,is good
1610050637,Plenty of gameplay for someone with enough time
1610050636,I dont understand the hate.   Have some audio issues though.
1610050451,"Despite the bugs, its a very good RPG"
1610050384,"it needs lots of more work, i want my money back."
1610050378,"Shallow, soulless game-play. Outdated and inconsequential RPG elements. Lifeless and stupid AI. Poor attention to detail. Honestly the only good thing is the graphics."
1610050175,Few bugs but still awesome!
1610050111,"Dont listen to the crybaby g a m e r s who thought that this game would cure their gaming depression and that it would be as intricate as a D&D game.

Is it everything they promised? No.

Is it still filled with incredible content? Yes."
1610049941,bugs are good
1610049909,"Honestly, I don't see the major bugs everyone is complaining about. I have seen a few visual bugs, of some objects in hands not showing up every once and a while, such as lighters or biochips. Maybe a few floating items here and there.  The worst glitch I've seen was a ""glitch"" affect used during certain events, get stuck on until game restart. 

All In all though, Nothing I have found has been game breaking, and I have really been enjoying the game so far. Many complain about how quickly they have gone through the story. I think its important to remember that you only get to play a game the first time, once. Enjoy the experience, stop and do side missions, enjoy driving around town. I'm almost 50 hours into the game, and I don't believe Im half way through"
1610049826,It's aight.
1610049796,Still just a fun game with great quests
1610049721,The feeling of being there - of walking the streets of the future - is really breathtaking.
1610049309,nice game
1610049284,A bit dark at times but overall great gameplay and character development.
1610049155,"Incredible game, gotta have top of the line tech to run it."
1610049041,"Man this game is more fake news than CNN on a good day. Hell I think CNN and the Russians worked on this game together! put it this way all the trailers that you seen on this game is completely fake CD projekt Red cut so much content the game is unplayable. the game feels completely Hollow in unfinished. the game is completely sensored so enjoy, that's even after they said they wouldn't  censor the game, save your money!"
1610049008,"I just finished the main story of this game after about 80 hours of playing.  I have not finished every side quest yet but I've done a ton of them.  I would recommend this game based just on the story and atmosphere of the game alone.  Voice acting is top notch and the choices you make do matter and pulls you in to feel part of the world.
That being said, I will not deny there are bugs/issues that need to be resolved.  Nothing I encountered was game-breaking.  My personal experience is on the hardest difficulty the game became too easy.  In fact, when I go through my 2nd playthrough I will probably finish the story sooner for a challenge.  Doing so many side quests will level you up and pretty much over-power you to the story.  I know this is something they can fix and hopefully they will in time.  I look forward to the DLC's and any expansions they make for this game.  I do believe they should prioritize their time right now on just bugs and balancing.  
I look forward to what the future will bring for this game to make it even better!"
1610068716,"NOTE: My review of this game reflects my own personal experience with it.

Let's get the ugly, but necessary, discussion out of the way. If no one had told me about the drama surrounding this game's disastrous launch, I would have considered this game no more broken than any large open world game at launch. 

When Skyrim launched it was about as full of glitches and bugs as Cyberpunk 2077. I haven't experienced any massive game breaking bugs in the 30 hours I've played this game. 
That's not to say that my experience is the definitive one, only that I cannot criticize a game for problems I did not encounter. If I can look at a game like Skyrim's bugs as funny little quirks necessary to building a massive open world, then I can laugh at and enjoy a man dressed in bandages walking straight up to me and T posing. Truly a cyberpsycho if I ever met one.

As for the game, this is a game that is entirely about style, atmosphere and vibe. What RPG mechanics exist are quite thin, and the game world doesn't feel quite as interactive as the The Witcher 3. When walking through the streets of night city, or driving through the badlands just outside of the game's main setting, the world feels real and lived in. Stepping over trash on the sidewalks of quiet empty streets at 3 a.m. while the streets, wet from a recent rainfall, reflect the orange glow of streetlights above, recreates a feeling that I have only ever experienced when doing the same in my own city.  

NPC's are the same as they were in CD Projekt Red's previous outing, in that they spew a random line upon interacting with them, with a select few npc's given a depth of character that is simply the best in the industry. The surprisingly deep sidequests twist and turn and provide depth and honesty to a tortured corpofascist hellscape. 

[spoiler] I took a simple hit job where the client wanted to tag along, only to find that the client's wife was killed by the target and we were to ambush his police escort, only to find that said target was a reformed Christian who was trying to make peace with the families of his victims, only to then find out that this murderer was set to star in a high budget snuff film recreation of The Passion. Not only did all of this make sense in context, but the characters were written incredibly well. The pseudo intellectualism and spirituality of the reformed murderer just barely masking a truly sinister insanity felt more real than any video game character I have encountered. [/spoiler]

The combat is somewhat wonky in terms of feel. The gunplay is fun and NPC's visibly react to larger guns in varied ways, but playing as a bare gorilla armed street brawler is truly the way to experience this game. Launching gangoons across the room with my always-cocked haymaker is so very satisfying. 

If you enjoyed The Witcher 3, and you want an open world that feels nearly real with sidequests that are as varied as they are interesting, you will enjoy Cyberpunk 2077."
1610048924,"I would say this is a perfect game but the bugs make me restart my game every few hours or so. I was able to do teh whole main game on my first playthrough sub 30 hours doing majority of the side quests in the game that looked good to me like Johnny Silverhand's quests which are my favorite ones in the game. The story is great at most times except a few things that make me think the game gave ******SPOILER******Takemura a pathetic death not being able to see him die and the same the with T-bug in the start I know its supposed to make you think at anytime anyone you care about can go except they don't show either of these two die in the game and just say so. The gameplay for the game wouldn't be to special if it wasn't for the cybernetics allowing you to enhance combat in the game.
Keanu Reeve's character was one of the best parts of the game acting like Brad Pitt in fight club which I really enjoyed. The game also has some pretty great references to songs like Beat on The Brat from the Ramones in titles of songs and call backs to 2020.
Overall it's a great game with a lot of problems and company problems so I would wait a few months and patches to come out."
1610048808,"Yeah it has it's fair share of issues, bugs, glitches, weird shit, and some times feels like something is missing. But honestly the writing, the story, the characters, it's all so fucking amazing I get sucked right in anyways. Got almost every ending, and starting on my third playthrough already, trying the different lifepaths and playstyles. 

It's not even the epic boss battles, sweet hacking abilities, big story moments, or various twists and turns you take while playing that makes this game amazing to me... No, it's the quiet moments that really make this make this game come to life for me. (No spoilers) Sitting and listening to a character play guitar out on the water, having some fun at the amusement park area in Pacifica with your choom, and other fun little moments that you would completely miss if you only run though the main quests. (: Can't wait to see what happens in the future with this game, cause I know they'll be working on fixing all the issues first, and then I'm really interested in seeing where the DLC and Expansions take this game because WOW those endings :O That's all I'm saying.

They did a great job of really making me give a shit about the characters and what was going on in the world. (Take a moment sometimes to sit down and watch the news channels, cause there is some interesting stuff there.)

Overall, still a great game. Can't wait to see what's coming next, because it can only get better from here!"
1610048618,Pretty Great
1610048464,"I love playing this game. I thought after all of the negativity, I would have realized that I was wrong about talking so highly of this game, but after a couple weeks of not playing it after I beat the main story (due to me being frustrated at the lack of depth in NPCs, it kind of killed the whole vibe for me. I found myself actually playing this game more than any other. It still needs so much work, and i'm curious how much they can really improve. But the map itself is INSANE how many things there are to explore. Maybe once multiplayer comes out it will be the game we all dreamed of."
1610048377,"Определённо да, это стоит внимания и времени. Сюжет огонь, повороты и развороты сюжета, местами, оставляют в лёгком (или не очень) ахуе. Широкая линейка побочных квестов, которые бывают не менее интересны, чем основная ветка сюжета. Атмосфера и погружение - на отлично. Количество отсылок - больше чем в ккой-либо пройденной ранее мной игре :) Мои самые любимые на Мистер и Миссис Смит и Брат-2.

Игра оставляет некий налёт недоделанности. Чувствуется, что выпускали в спешке и многое безжалостно было порезано и не доделано. Очень жаль. С другой стороны, даже так - это шикарно, и оно таки вышло. Было бы очень круто, если бы свет увидела полностью допиленная игра, но случится это или нет - мы не знаем.

Отдельно про саундтрек. Очень мало игр, которые я проходил под оригинальный саундтрек. Так вот - это одна из них. Трэки шикарны, на мой вкус.

Прошёл на ту концовку, которая мне понравилась. Пошёл изучать другие :) Потом буду проходить на других уровнях сложности и продолжать смаковать детали."
1610047938,"This game as a game is pretty intense. Some features seemed rushed, and pretty sure several features were removed due to deadlines and will be added in forthcoming updates. But whatever is there still is pretty intense.

However, this game as a service leaves lot to be desired. Still, better story and characters than a lot of other similar genre of games out there. Personally, I found the story way more engaging than GTA V or RDR2, partially due to more appealing and diverse array of characters. 

Is it better than TW3? Probably not, nor will it come close ever. TW3's inherent theme, setup and premise already makes it a superior game, further supported by some incredibly well-created characters. Sure as hell V can never be as legendary as Geralt... or Panam/Judy be remotely as great as Triss/Yennefer. But even after all that, this game still holds its own.

My opinion: It is a Witcher game set in the Night City of year 2077. The way the game plays out, crafting works, missions and side-quests unravel and the NPCs react, is more or less the same. Even the looting system and inventory management is also similar. It was a Witcher-like experience, but in a modern premise (not the same, doesn't top TW3 by any stretch, but similar). For me, the storyline and character/NPC development has always been a major criteria. Albeit AI/physics issues and occasional glitches, the story holds its own, and the character is still given lot of freedom in their choices and the branching outcomes. So it deserves at least one playthrough, especially if you were big on TW3 or GTA V or RDR2. Might wanna hold off your purchase or experience till at least 2 more major updates, but definitely a game to be kept in the bucketlist for all your to-be-purchases."

1610047632,"Gameplay is the best I've seen since Skyrim, loot is everywhere and everything you find is valuable in someway, driving is difficult, but the quests are worth it"
1610047496,"Everything they say is true.
- There are more bugs here than in the Amazon Rainforest.
- Driving anywhere in the game runs the certainty of mowing over a pedestrian and attracting the police due to the horrible mouse and keyboard controls.
- Melee combat is flaccid attack spamming until whatever is in front of you turns to red mist or you die.
- There are too many ways to reduce combat to one-click easy mode, from silenced revolvers to tranquilizer grenade arm to just owning a legendary cyberdeck with the right hacks in it.
- Perks are a crapshoot, some useless, some practically mandatory.
- You can complete every quest, sidequest, and minor icon on the map and have about enough money to buy less than half the cars in the game, or all the cyberware you want. Choose one.
- You can complete every quest, sidequest, and minor icon on the map and not have a single skill leveled to rank 20.

BUT
This game has a goddamn heart and soul to it. From arguing on rooftops about cats and food, to chilling and closing your eyes while someone plays the guitar, to huddling in an abandoned farmhouse, listening to the sandstorm shake the world around you, to riding the goddamn roller coaster, this game has a million ways get you warm and fuzzy, if only you'll let it."

1610046964,"There are many elements of game play that I enjoy from this release. Specifically, I really enjoyed the ability to fully customize my avatar's appearance and that I did not have to specify a gender, but rather a ""body type"". This meant that the primary protagonist could be any gender and present themselves as  I desired. I think that this is  more than just a marketing gimmick. It really provides for greater custom game play. I have not completed the main quest story line yet. But, as much of this game rests on the backdrop of night city, I think it is important to remark on the presentation of the different body types in the city and story. I noticed that both body types were regularly objectified in order to sell goods in advertising I would see around the city. However, I did notice that the more female appearing body type appeared with greater frequency in less clothed situations. The game often uses these less clothed people as backdrops and puts them into a more passive role. And in many cases, it appears that the 3D models explicitly exist for the purpose being objects of the male gaze. But there are many moments in which non males move the story along and have decisive roles. Over all, I have a RTX3070, so the game looks great and plays well above 60FPS while rendering in a way I have never seen before. The game play is pretty standard FPS with some RPG elements. But the environment is immersive as well as breathtaking. I would like it if more gender ambiguous characters had more roles however. And, I fully promote the idea of objectifying everyone equally, if we are going tro be objectifying folk."
1610046845,"Awesome game. One of the best I've ever played. Loved every hour spent in the Night City. Can't wait for more!
Glitches? Sure. Doesn't change anything, still awesome game."
1610046828,"Currently I have about 130 hours in this game (~70 hours offline because of a bug with overlays that I didn't figure out for a while) and if there's anything that I can say about the game, it's that it's fun. It's definitely been plagued with bugs, but with the patches that CDPR's been rolling out, the big one are fixed (as far as I know, I haven't run into any other than a quest-line bug that was fixed a couple patches ago). Are there still small bugs? Yes. Do they really affect the gameplay? Not really.

I never got into the hype that was the announcement and build up to this game, so from a completely objective point-of-view, the game's really fun. I knew nothing about it other than the name and that Keanu Reeves played a character in it when I picked it up and I honestly haven't been this sucked into a game in a long time. If you enjoy open-world games and exploring (especially exploring where you shouldn't be exploring because the game makes it pretty easy to do so) I'd say pick it up. If you enjoy RPGs or FPSs where you can choose whether or not to be merciful or lethal, I'd say pick it up. If you have any interest in it, I'd say pick it up, give it a try, and just determine by yourself if it's something you enjoy."
1610046800,"My criteria for a Recommend or Don't Recommend for all games is simply: ""I've finished the game. Do I want to play it again?""
Yes. I want to play Cyberpunk 2077 again.

I've complete two different endings of the game with the same Corpo character and there are no more jobs on the map. And it was a fun ride. There were lots of glitches. The dead walked again. The unconscious kept talking. Cars fell from the sky. The wind blew so hard that palm trees bent and touched the ground. I fell through the ground no less than three times. The NPC in the car with me sounded like they were talking over a radio. Some NPCs died no matter what kind of non-lethal take downs I did. Run over by cars that spawned right next to me on empty streets.

But it was all fun.

I have 128 hours in the game and I'm going to uninstall it. I want to re-play it now, but I'm going to wait until Dec 2021. Give CDPR time to patch and add more content. Hopefully I'll be able to upgrade from my GTX1080 to a card with ray tracing by then as well. For now I have a lot of good memories from this first time playing and am looking forward to the next re-play."
1610102503,"•	Everyone in the game has futuristic modded out cars, yet you cannot modify your vehicle and there are no vehicle repair shops. The driving itself feels lifeless and feels not fun, and I found myself using fast travel through the whole game when possible. Never once did I feel the need to buy a new vehicle as they all felt the same. 

•	This is a gigantic futuristic city with exactly 4 types of vendors. And one of them is a junk shop with literal junk that you can't use or even place in your apartment. I want to at least put the dildo I bought somewhere.

•	Where is the drone shop? Surveillance drones, hobby drones to fly around the city. Any kind of drone? 

•	Your apartment is useless. Sleeping is useless. Showering is useless. The stash is useless. You can't spend any money that you siphoned from a box on the wall somewhere to upgrade your apartment or god forbid buy a new one in the gigantic city.

•	There's only two joytoys that you can rent overnight as far as I can tell and that seems very implausible for such a big city let alone night city. To be fair I have heard there are four. Regardless, in this sex obsessed metro, sex seems to be in small supply.  

•	NPC's are shallow. The guy with shorts and cowboy boots is everywhere. 1 in 5 females you talk to say they need a short nap. 

•	The crafting and the inventory hurts my brain. There is no list or anything and the icons are impossible. I hate opening that menu."
1610046698,"Alright, official review of Cyberpunk 2077 from yours truly.
Story is great, linear, but great. You'll be listening and talking for a while, think maybe around 10 minutes? Didn't exactly record. The writing kept me focused so I guess that means something. My only fault is something that happens pretty early, but is also important. SPOLILIOLOIOPPS. [spoiler] So Jackie ends up dying at the end of Act I and it kinda falls flat on it's ass for me. The beginning of the game hooks you with Jackie and then you have a 6 month time jump where you're supposed to care about him. I did care, but I wished the time jump was playable in some spots. Well done and everything, but it's lacking. [/spoiler] Everything else is great though. Lifepaths are neat, but they don't change the story all that much, it acts more like extra dialogue and a free speech check.
Gameplay is, well it's an RPG. The way it handles difficulty is something I don't like. Higher difficulty = enemies have higher health and more damage, while you don't. So I ended up playing normal for most of it. You don't see the levels of your enemies or your guns, and that's something that was left out of the previews for some reason. Rather know who I'm going up against.
Guns do their job, some feel nice like the GRAD, which is just an anti-material rifle. Animations are decent as well. 
Vehicles feel like shit sometimes, especially on bikes. Slow down on a turn and your back wheel swings to either direction. Nothing exactly impressive, models are cool though.
Music is fucking great. Doesn't shy away from using other instruments and the electronic track is a banger. 
Bugs are there, but not game breaking. Just a lot of stupid ass bugs like your car doing a 90 degrees after running over 6 people and people going through entire floors. 
Performance was iffy. I had some really bad frame drops on some high density areas. Might just be cause my machine teeter between low and high requirements.
Can recommend if you don't give a shit about it being game of the year or the bugs."

1610045186,A very stylish game. Overstyle. An interesting scenario. Extremely dense for details. The game has a soul.
1610044976,Nothing like what was sold to us. classic bait & switch.
1610044859,"Graphics: 10/10

Technical state right now: 5/10

You definitely need to play this, but if you're not in a hurry and want to maximise the game experience you should wait for more bug fixes and patches."
1610044847,"Love everything about this game, just an awesome game! Could care less about the little bugs, they'll get fixed."
1610044759,"Don't trust reviews about the game being bad because it was buggy. It had a rough launch and development, but story and gameplay are good."
1610044670,"forget the hype and the hate- this game is amazing.  i bought a new pc just to play this game and i was not disappointed.  this is potentially a new generation of gaming and cyberpunk is the milestone of that new generation.  yes, there are some bugs- if you're using old gen tech to play the newest game on the market then you are definitely going to have problems.  just to test that statement, i installed the game on my old pc initially to see what people were crying about.  and there were some serious problems.  but once i hooked up the new pc and got going its been a smooth, immersive experience.  it honestly reminds me of when no man's sky came out and people thought the game was trash- but the core concept was there.  the dev team worked tirelessly since release to address the issues and enhance the gameplay until the current version and the original release were unrecognizable.  i would like to think that will be the case with cyberpunk.  time will tell, but i am already hooked.  if they release multiplayer like they plan to, this game may become the best game of its time.  we'll see"
1610044685,"After nearly attaining 100% completion of the game (some achievements are glitched), I can confidently say that Cyberpunk is one of my favorite games I have played in a long time. It undoubtedly has many issues, such as no vehicle customization, clearly unfinished police/wanted system, and lack of gun customization and guns in general. The world feels quite large but also quite empty at the same time, with most buildings being there for aesthetic. 

Another complaint I want to address that I have not seen enough people talk about is the lackluster romance system. NPC's are locked into a specific sexuality so you cannot romance them if you choose the opposite gender to play, which limits player choice and agency. Outside of story NPC's, there are only a couple of other instances where you can have an intimate encounter with someone, which, once again, makes the world feel more empty even though it is quite large. Also, driving sucks. It's just bad.

As far as what I enjoyed, the story and side quests are phenomenal; some of the best in any open world game that I have played. Even though the life path you choose has very little effect outside of the first hour, the variety of dialogue options is quite large in some cases and can vastly change the outcome of a scenario. Some of the side quests have an impact on the main quest and can ""unlock"" alternative ending choices that best suit the character you have crafted yourself to be. The gunplay takes a little time to adjust to, but once you learn it, it becomes quite fun. The amount of variety you have in terms of equipment such as gorilla fists/mantis blades or focusing on a tech build to hack every enemy in the area can keep combat fresh and fun. This game is also visually the best looking game I have ever played. I ran the game on Ultra with Ray Tracing and maintained a solid 50 fps, which made the experience far more enjoyable and life-like. 
     
Oh, and Keanu is great as Silverhand.
    
All in all, Cyberpunk is a fantastic experience and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys open world games that can keep you engaged for dozens of hours."
1610044578,Disappointment. Too many glitches and poor controls.
1610044413,"Disappointing. 

It didn't live up to the hype that had been held for a year before it's release, lot's of bugs, vehicles are hell to drive, and fights are somewhat boring.

All in all it's not a bad game, but it's not a very good game either. It will definitely keep you playing some hours so I'm still recommending it."

1610042481,"Despite the glitches, bugs, and performance issues, I think the game itself is playable.
Comparing to The Witcher 3, I finished this game much faster on the first run.
It took me 22 hours to go through the bad(?) ending unintentionally. After that, you can't do anything at all because the story's done and the game's done too. You can't walk around the city or finishing up your side quests after the ending. That's why the number of players are decreasing so fast. 
Personally, I think the quest system from The Witcher 3 is more smooth and you can change your direction to finish your side quests before progressing to the new area. For Cyberpunk, it's like I have no idea what should I do other than continue my main story progression.

1610042087,"Wait for a price drop and more patches, I doubt CDPR will be capable of giving back all the features it promised. 

In its current state, despite its good story, Cyberpunk is an underwhelming buggy mess and resembles nothing like the gameplay demo CDPR had demonstrated. It lacks basic features that were present in games released from the PS2 era. 

It needed at least another year before it was released. This is unacceptable. 

-Police spawn exactly where you commit the crime and are easy to escape from

-Stupid NPC ""AI"" that just walk or stand around doing one activity the whole day. No ""day/night cycles""

-3rd person mode is completely missing

- only one safehouse in the whole game. You can't buy properties. 

-looks customization is minimal and can't be changed in the future

-very little differences in player lifepaths

- physics are terrible as well as no destructible environments (completely changed from the demo)

- no wall running with the mantis blades

- 90% of the ""big"" player choices don't impact the ending 

- no ability to shoot out of vehicles

- there's verticality but there's no ability to explore the giant skyscrapers with flying vehicles. (even the map size is small)

- objects pop in and out of existence even on high settings 

- objects explode for no reason

- many NPCs are stuck in a perpetual T pose

- the game runs awful even on a GTX 1060 (recommended specs) and is unplayable on current gen 
consoles. I had two crashes. 

- animations are choppy and graphics are not impressive unless you have a 3000 series graphics card which are all out of stock

- no environmental takedowns

- no inspection system

- you can't rob stores

- weapon stats are just DPS and damage (not what they advertised)

- interactions with NPCs and activities are far from being deep or immersive

Hugely disappointing game that gives very little satisfaction on completion (and I even got the ""best ending""). There's very little replay value. Even though the visuals are gorgeous at times(I don't even have ray tracing),  this game is still not worth 60 dollars. I still have to complete some side missions and try to get all the endings in this short, albeit, entertaining story.

1610039632,"This travesty of a game should have been drop kicked into Holiday of 2021 where it may have seen a stable release. The first few missions are great. I started the game, I was amazed, The world looked great, the voice acting was good at the start, and the game was fun, I did a little walking around, talking to people, learned a bit about the mechanics, and then that's where my excitement, and hype turned into disappointment.

The game is playable, you can play through it and beat it, for that, it's at least a functioning product. However it barely functions.

Every single corner I turn, and almost everything I do, leads to a bug or a glitch. I can't even quit the game without it crashing on exit, or still running in the background somehow. The optimization is terrible. With everything on the lowest settings, and everything on the highest settings, the game runs the exact same, which is laggy and under 60 fps, so the graphics options don't even fix the FPS.
Driving in this game is the worst. Cars pop in and out randomly, same with people, sometimes cars will spawn directly inside your vehicle while you're driving, and that'll send you flying in the sky.

All in all, the world looks great, the missions are great, the characters are great.. The game is terribly unfinished. IF you're planning on picking this game up, get it for a real good deal, I can't believe I paid a full 80 dollars for this hot piece of garbage."
1610039579,muitos bugs pra um jogo recém lançado porém quem curte rpg de vdd vai achar mt foda a lore!
1610039562,Yeah it has bugs and CDPR really did disappoint us gamers especially the ones hyped about the game however it is not a bad game and you can`t really hate on it. It has a lot of potential and I`m sure that CDPR will do their very best to fully repair all that is wrong with this game because they spent a fortune on this game and they HAVE to make it better especially if there is going to be an online mode. The negative comments are fully right however most haven`t even completed the game lol so don`t decide to not buy this game depending on those comments. If you want to get it wait a bit until it gets a sale or whatever because I think that this game will improve with time. Im not defending CDPR or anything they had plenty of time in my opinion but I actually am going to RECOMMEND buying this game despite everything wrong with it.
1610039541,Lies
1610039256,I'm really enjoying this game. There have been a couple of little bugs but nothing game breaking and the graphics are top notch.
1610039220,"Honestly, this game is incredible. I've never experienced more immersion to an open world environment with any other game than Cyberpunk. The design and layout of the city is better than any game I've ever played, every corner is enticing and detailed. Also very well written, as expected from CDPred after playing Witcher 3. Voice acting is great, graphics and facial features are great, enemy NPC dialogue is meh. Weapons are wonderful. Many times I've been in awe at the variety and specific usefulness of each type of weapon. Mantis blades are beautiful, but sadly don't show up in photo mode and the stealth options for it are a bit lackluster, but enjoyable nonetheless.

I must be one of the lucky ones, any glitch I've had has either been so seldom or so insignificant that it barely breaks immersion. The worst I've ever gotten was weird tree warping and a T-posing glitch, Nothing game-breaking. Performance isn't bad either. With an i7 8700k, a 1070ti on a 1440p UW, i can put it roughly between medium/high but appears as ultra as any other game released last year. I cant even imagine how immersive it would be on an RTX card, but even at these settings it looks great. After 66 hours of play, I have also never experienced a single crash. Likely just me. Thumbs down this review if you're salty that another AAA title was released with bugs, like the rest of them, you degenerates"
1610039160,"Yes the Game has minor issues, but from what I have played so far, I love the missions, the city and the characters in the game, I actually love just wondering around the city always something different, hopefully future patches will fix any annoying little bugs, and any future DLC free or paid will expand the game to the masterpiece it deserves to be, and in my opinion it is far better the GTAV, though I imagine some people will disagree. Long Live Cyberpunk 2077."
1610039002,"Even though it is super buggy, it is still pretty good."
1610038983,"Personally I enjoyed every second of this game. I've played for 62 hours on 1.06 and have not experienced many bugs, only about three. After completing my version of the story and experiencing the side missions, combat, crafting, and other aspects of the game, I can say I would recommend this game for anyone. The world feels great to drive (though can feel a bit slippery at times) around in, the combat feels fun, the crafting is fair, a sizable chunk of the side missions are very entertaining, and the story (albeit simple) was done, in my opinion, satisfyingly. My only gripes are that it doesn't have NG+ (which will more than likely be implemented in the future) and that I had trouble getting a side quest mission to work properly. Otherwise, it has overall been an enjoyable experience and i plan to make more save games to experience the other backgrounds and endings I may get."
1610038963,"While yes this game is buggy at times but the worst one I encountered was my crafting level stopping at lvl.8 but other then that the world is good especially when you know the world and gives new players a look into what's happened before the game. Driving isn't so good but the physics are great. Shooting is better then I expected not to the level of say Bungie or Infinity Ward but still pretty good. Voice acting is also good at times other then Male V maybe putting to much into it.

I recommend playing it when more bugs are patched out and the free dlc is out."
1610038930,"When they get the bugs out it will be even better but its great!
"
1610038911,Yay
1610038836,The character's penis pops through the zipper if you change pants - 10/10
1610038696,Don't listen to the BS. The bugs are not as bad as they say. Story is awesome and the world is immersive.
1610038500,"9/10

An incredibly engaging and somewhat flawed narrative experience set in a beautiful, hopeful, yet bleak city. CDPR didn't make the game everyone wanted that's for sure, but after playing it for 100+ hours while getting to know V, Johnny, Night City Itself, and the rest of the well-written cast of characters made me realize and appreciate that this ""final"" product is at least what CDPR wanted to make and for us to experience. It's not perfection encapsulated in video game form, but what it does right really pushes narrative storytelling and interaction to a level that every other RPG-esque experience should definitely emulate in the future.

I'm very much looking forward to all the DLC they will be putting out this year as I'm now itching to find my next reason to go back and walk the streets of Night City again."
1610038449,"There are so many other performance issues with this game other than the real obvious bugs.
I would purchase this game again next year when they have completed the development of it. Meanwhile I have submitted refund request for this incomplete and unfinished product sold by the developer but pedalled by Steam"
1610043202,"TL;DR: Don't buy. It's unfinished and simply not what was promised. I personally enjoyed it tho.

[b][u]General Thoughts[/u][/b]

First off, I enjoyed my 50 hours with Cyberpunk so far. I played on PC, equipped with generous hardware though (check my profile for more), so your experience from a graphical/technical perspective might differ.
I encountered a small amount of bugs, which were mostly funny or dumb in nature, or a minor annoyance at most.
Still, under no circumstances do I wanna overlook the horrendous state the game is in on other platforms/hardware.
The game has some glaring issues that really hurt the fan in me. Cyberpunk was gonna be my game to look forward to in 2020 (considered, the year was already shitty enough). Sadly, CDPR couldn't deliver.
In my opinion, the game should have never been announced for last-gen consoles.
Also, the implementation of RTX appears to have made a huge impact on development. The game is poorly optimized, no doubt.

Let's dig a bit deeper.

[b][u]Performance/Graphics[/u][/b]

I run on a 3070 and a Ryzen 5600X. Pretty fucking decent hardware, one could say. Still, on Ultra Settings, 1080p, I get a measly 70fps average. City center dips to the 50fps range occasionally. Not bad, but still disappointing.

The game changer here really is DLSS. Turn this setting to Quality or Performance, no further. Everything beyond ""Performance"" is gonna look like cereal.

It's noticeable that CDPR heavily cut the engine's performance to make it run smoothly on semi-decent hardware. I'm talking: Crowds of people that just get rendered out if you look away. Cars that change color once you turn around and then look at them again. The game goes to great lengths of cutting down rendered objects to make it run smoothly. It's truly gut-wrenching. Imagine if CDPR had gone full throttle with no compromises. There wouldn't be a single computer worth 2500 bucks or less capable of running this game. LET ALONE the PS5/XSX. We're not even talking about PS4/XOne here.

Despite all these compromises to give the game a better performance, it still bugs out all the time.
Cars are stuck in each other and fly in all directions once you touch them. People get stuck in their positions, not even killing them does a thing to their posture or position. There's flickering on the road and other textures. If you drive a car while using DLSS, the tail-light reflections get quadrupled and leave a weird trail for some reason.

And these are just a few of the visual bugs I encountered.
Now, I can look past that. Mostly. But it still leaves that feeling of ""Oh god, I wasted money on this?""

On the other hand, the game is simply stunning. Visuals and Textures are solid across the board. Lighting, even without RTX On is really nice. The game creates a lot of atmosphere just with the visuals alone.
There is so much attention to detail in everything. The cars, the different city districts, the houses, the advertisements, etc. etc. etc.
Of course, there are lots of reused textures, but everyone does that. Cmon.

Character models are beautifully done. Don't get me started. 
I think Panam and Rogue are some of the most convincing and beautiful character models I've ever seen.
The main characters are a total feast for the eyes. They are truly a sight to behold and make playing the side-quests so much more worth it.

[b][u]Audio/Sound Design/Voice Acting[/u][/b]

I have some big issues with the audio.
The biggest problem is that some parts of environmental audio just keep cutting in and out randomly.
There are cutscenes in which you only hear your character grunting, despite being in a fight, while beating someone to the ground. It gets extremely awkward at times.
Also, people will deliver some sentences with completely different cadence, with a completely different voice filter/setup, as if re-recorded And those moments aren't far and in-between. It happens all the time.

It just screams ""unfinished and rushed"". It's that bad.

Sound Design in general is pretty okay.
It's nothing special, nothing that would make you go ""wow"".

Voice acting is spot-on for the most part.
Even pedestrian one-liners sound believable.
Especially for the main characters, their voices carry a lot of - well - character. Hah.

Except for the two most important characters.
HOW COULD THEY FUCK THIS UP????

I've only played female V so far, but it's been really disappointing and even cringe at some points.
V just sounds so disinterested. At best, V manages to sound cynical and edgy, maybe sarcastic. The rest is some mish-mash of neutral and tired. It's really weird. The female voice actor sounds like purposefully lowering their tone to sound tough, like one would do in 6th grade, before puberty really hits.
I hate it.

Johnny Fucking Silverhand.
It's less bad than on V. I like Keanu Reeves as an actor, and I adore a lot of the roles he played.
I think Johnny's voice acting is okay for the most part. But there's little character in it. There are situations in which Johnny just sounds so out-of place.
Beating a guy to the ground in a club, Johnny says ""Sit, Stay!"". Pretty badass, right?
Except Keanu managed to make it sound like he's reading ingredients from the back of the pasta box.

I think this has to do with rushing game production as well. It feels like the actors for V, Johnny and some others (very occasionally) haven't been properly introduced to the scene they're playing.

This only gets amplified by the audio bugs I mentioned above.
It really hurts.

[b][u]Gameplay[/u][/b]

Gameplay is... I dunno. Alright.

Most side quests are the usual ""fetch/kill/bring and deliver"". Add all the other stuff one would expect from an open-world RPG/Adventure.

Story- and Side-Quests are done nicely, I enjoyed all of the ""meaningful quests"" thouroughly.

Gunplay feels nice, the melee weapons are okay but kinda obsolete.
Perks  do basically nothing for you. For being advertised as an RPG, the skill trees feature next to no new ""abilities"". Only percentual bonuses to stats you or your weapons might have. Epic.
Apart from quickhacking and stealth, the perks have little impact on how you play.
The most impactful upgrades are the cybernetics.
The whole skill system feels like a rushed afterthought.

Again, it just screams unfinished.

Bugs here are limited to certain quest triggers not happening, forcing you to reload a save file.
Not too bad. I haven't had any quests hard-lock my game. (yet?)

NPCs are laughable. Apart from the usual shopkeepers and vendors, or quest-related NPCs, the pedestrians are totally replaceable.
All they can do is walk around, cower in fear, run away, or drive straight. It's honestly impressive how much CDPR was able to contradict their own promises.
I mean, the NPCs literally disappear when you walk a block. ""Daily routine"" my ass.
Also, the city has the highest number of identical twins in any work of fiction. It's insane.

[b][u]Story[/u][/b]

The story is nicely done, in my opinion.
It's nothing praiseworthy. no heart-wrenching drama, no gigantic plot-twists...

But the story and dilemma of V creates lots of stuff to think and talk about.
The notion of self gets questioned, family, death, afterlife and personal growth play big roles. There's criticism on basically any modern way of living everywhere. but CDPR managed to not over-do it.

I won't go into much detail here, but I enjoyed the story, extended through sidequests, a lot.

[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]

Cyberpunk 2077 is.. a guilty pleasure?
Maybe I am easy to impress, but if I can find one or two things that make a game interesting for me, it's worth playing and liking to me. The characters and story really saved this game.

There are glaring issues that will definitely ruin the experience for many players.

But to face the facts, this game isn't recommendable.
At this point (January 2021) it doesn't come close to a AAA experience.
CDPR ""promised"" to re-do big parts of the game until June '21, so maybe get the game then."
1610038289,yes
1610038222,"Awesome game with many directions the game can go in love it !!!
"
1610038188,"Rating: 4/5
A great concept marred by tons of bugs. For me it was still playable/enjoyable and felt like a futuristic Fallout 3/4 (which I loved). Specific kudos to the voice acting (top notch, even on smaller characters) and the music. Combat was fun but still felt similiar to Fallout or Farcry style. Wasn't too keen on the ending, especially since it seemed to come so soon (I thought i was 1/2 way through the game)."
1610038142,...
1610038042,Good game
1610037765,c
1610037682,"The story and characters are just amazing, I did not experience much glitches due to the fact my pc can run this game. However, I recommend you check youtube to make sure you can run the game before buying it, or wait for the optimization updates."
1610037602,"As I looked out my window, I pondered. Could the perfect game possibly exist? I paced the length of my room anxiously, biting my finger nails and wistfully nibbling the end of my half mooned spectacles. By this point, all of youth had drained away, leaving a dry and shriveled husk of manhood that had blossomed from a depressing year. I sat at my desk, at my wits end, when I heard it. ""wow"" says the soothing voice of Owen Wilson. Then I knew. Cars The Game (2006). Like God descending from Heaven to create his Adam, I fired up Steam and found my divine purpose. After descending the ludicrous asking price of $20, to a much more reasonable $6.99, my year was salvaged. I dropped into the wondrous world of cars yet again, like a veteran soldier on the battlefield, and felt joy no man has felt since the debut of the 2006 cinematic masterpiece of the same name. Heed this my children, Cars The Game is pretty okay, but not for $20."
1610037470,"In my opinion this game is a 7/10 and was disappointing even though I expected a good, polished game.

PROS

The story is actually very good yet the endings (No spoilers) left me disappointed, since the none of the endings gave me the answers I wanted, and left a sour taste in my mouth. 

The character customization is decent just wish that they had sliders for certain things.

The clothing is very good and give off nice cyberpunk vibes but most of the game you look dumb as fuck since you usually just put on what has the best stats.

The city gives off that cyberpunk, dystopian vibe you expect from this type of setting.

Graphics are pretty good. 

The skill tree system is average, it's large but nothing new to be honest. 

The side quests are really good and some entertaining. I just wish they let us know which one is a simple, ""kill this dude and leave"" and which one is one the side quests that are entertaining or so good they feel like a main mission.

The characters are good and rub off on you eventually. They also have nice design.

The technology implants go crazy.

Johnny silverhand was pretty entertaining yet I feel as though the game forces a friendship between V and him. Also sometimes his voice acting just doesn't fit the emotion that is supposed to be shown.

CONS

Glitches are everywhere in this game. Glitches don't bug me but I can't ignore how many times I had to load from a save since I couldn't progress. Characters in cut scenes can be seen t posing, phasing through objects, dialogue not playing, lip syncing just not working, characters not spawning at quest locations, and much more. It happens so much that sometimes it ruins a major scene, for example in one scene some random started phasing into the car during a major scene which was supposed to be sad.

The gunplay is stiff, and boring. It doesn't have anything to make up for it either, for example, Fallout has below average gunplay yet makes up for it with VATS, but cyberpunk has nothing that saves the gunplay.

The melee is actually fun, but it's very average. I also wish they had more animations for whenever you kill an enemy with a heavy attack.

The AI is actually terrible. They're extremely inconsistent, one time you can stand face to face with it and they still won't see you, then next time they'll spot you through two walls. There's been so many times where the AI just stops shooting at me and just stares.

Most of the endings have similar outcomes, and none of them feel like you actually beat your problem, you only beat it for now.

Not really a con but I never felt a reason to buy a car since the fastest car is found in a cave for free.

Crowd density is unexpectedly low even on high density.

The optimization is poor even after the updates and driver updates.

The game should've been released at a later date.


"
1610037251,"Well i'll say what was already said: is buggy, feels a bit broken and the gameplay could have been sooo much better than what it is. The story and the visuals are the best thing about this game. What I want to say is that this game does not have the quality it should have had it feels rushed and unfinished. CDPR set the bar too damn high for open world RPGs and just for games in general with Witcher 3 which i think is not just good is the best in this particular category and purely a masterpiece of a video game. The people are dissapointed because they had astronomical expectations on this game unfortunently, but overall the game is good, it's actually pretty good and surely is worth playing if not at the relese then after a few months when the game is patched up and i would recommend it especially for the story which i think is pretty good. 7-7.5/10  good game."
1610037205,horrible experience and unplayable at times
1610037125,Can't play the game without it crashing after 3 minutes of playing. Issue is worse especially when driving.
1610036908,"Great game, you'll play it so much your friends will keep up with how many hours you've played for your own safety!"
1610036816,This game is cool but have a lot of bugs. graphics are good the story is cool but there are a LOT LOT LOT LOT bugs
1610036813,"Occasionally buggy, AI is a bit shit and sometimes people's mouths don't move when they talk. But I've got six days in this game so ya know it's pretty okay"
1610036708,This is kinda what I'd feel if Deus Ex and GTA had a baby that was so deformed it was locked away in a tower and died from lack of attention.
1610036649,"Well, it was worth to wait this game for almost six years, big thanks to Polish Choombas!"

1610036457,very immersive
1610035968,wow
1610035945,yes
1610035529,This game is nothing but a rail shooter with lots of cutscenes
1610035861,Great details and high level of freedom. However there are some issues with the main story line and I'm not sure if they are caused by bugs or what...
1610034988,"This game is like skyrim with shadowrun swag.
i want a hoover board dang it, it’s 2077! 
It has its bugs here and there but i’m sure the updates will fix all that is broken."
1610034914,"GG crackling sound oh sorry i mean bad game, for crying out loud if would have been fine if it was delayed."
1610034911,"GAMES BROKE, obviously missing the early access tab, story and characters easily make the game worth it. Bugs make it hard to play sometimes but I am having a blast, can't wait to see it finished!"
1610034821,it's a good game :)
1610034568,"I'm not sure what people are loving about the game. In my opinion this game does nothing great. The gameplay, gun play, and story are all mediocre. I went in with zero expectations, and I was still let down. Don't get my started on performance either. Half the time the game runs great and half the time the game is chugging. It feels like it is going for a Rage 2 approach but Rage 2 actually had some things it did very well (and yes some that it didn't do well). Overall I have found the game to be bland and forgettable so far"
1610034566,"The game is broken but the story is really good, I like it."
1610035012,I waited 8 years for this...?
1610034477,"The game has some problems. Problems that a AAA game should not have. Yes the world may seem a bit static after a while. Yes there are bugs. But honestly, imho, all that won't keep you from having a good time for a long time. Probably 60 bucks is too steep a price though, so I would wait until it drops a bit. Also maybe then the bugs and stuff get fixed too. But all in all, I'd definitely reccommend the game for what it is (not looking at what it claimed to be in PR...)"
1610067576,"Petition to open world game developers:
Start adding a non-quest notebook into games.
Sometimes we go by an interesting location we don't have time/skill to explore yet. Would be stellar to have a map marker with a custom note like this

Title: Militech shady biz
Description: Under the bridge, 4-5 high lvl troopers, some loot there? See when lvl up.

Plus a marker on the map where that was"
1610034278,"Feels like it needs another year in development. Tons of bugs, cut systems, dead feeling world/NPCs (RDR2 is vastly superior in this regard).

RTX is nice and and art direction/music is solid. I do like the characters and main story. But overall not inspired like the Witcher series was."
1610033999,"Better then witcher 3 in my opinion

1610033984,"now, i do have a decent computer with a ryzen 7 and a 2070 super, but i was able to play the game on medium settings mostly and had a blast so far, only got past the prologue before i decided to take a break, either its a long game or the prologue is long"
1610033864,"Driving is bad, combat is bad, stealth is bad, rpg elements are shallow, side quests are boring.
Main story is okay, Cool looking setting.
Hope we get another No Mans Sky redemption but this DEV team seems pretty dishonest imho.
I swear to never preorder another game."
1610033636,"Despite the over hype, the bugs at launch, the crits that just love to bash things this game is good.  It was buggy at launch but most games are and most of the bugs were funny not game play crushing. People just need to stop being impatient and let games release when they are ready instead of when they want them. Also people need to stop have high expectation and realize that marketing is made to get you excited and wanting more.  They leave us hanging and we shouldn't get mad when we fill in the blanks to create a fantasy of something that doesn't exist.

Overall game play is good.  Something like watchdogs or GTA with a little bit of Skyrim mixed in. You can choose your play style and approach a situation many ways.  The money grind can get a little boring and if you want fancy equipment, implants or cars you better do lots of side quests and sell everything you see.

Graphics 9 out of 10
Style 10 of 10
Sound 9 of 10
Storyline 8 of 10"
1610033524,"Any time I get in a car it crashes after a little bit, but not motorcycles."
1610033457,"Give it time. To be precise, give the talented (case in point: gorgeous city-scape and California desert imagery, dreamy neon-infused sights, awesome and unique animations for each gun, satisfying gunplay, immersive sound design) time to finish this game (that was unfortunately overhyped by both the studio and some over-zealous fans, which resulted in bugs galore, and on the console side, poor performance).

Some beginnings are rough. Give this a chance and it'll be pretty darn good."
1610033429,"♫ A thing of beauty,

“	Everything on full blast. They'll spot us extra for a wicked adrenaline high.	„
— Unnamed thug, Cyberpunk 2077


A braindance is a sort of personal version of the Net and genre of experimental sonic excursions. It is an immersive virtual reality and sonic complexity. Braindances enjoy wide use in the Cyberpunk world. They are most often used for entertainment (the new version of video games/TV/movies/breakbeats, or types of entertainment that combine them together). They are also used heavily in psychology (they are a core part of the therapy used to treat Cyberpsychosis). A braindance has all of the same aspects of the Net, except that it does not use the IG Transformation Algorithms and it does not actually interact with the real Net (if it does, it is no longer a Braindance, but actual Netrunning). Outside the Cyberpunk world, Rephlex, Warp, Schematics and Analogical Force cataloged Braindance. Which was pioneered by Richard D James aka Aphex Twin.

Cyberpunk 2077
For many Night City residents, crushing poverty and homelessness are significant and likely inescapable problems. Despite this, most are still entranced by the glitz of showbiz and luxurious lifestyles of the privileged elite. Breakthroughs in neural technology paved the way for people to share recordings of their own personal memories and emotions via tech known as ""braindance"" (or BD). Some BD productions put actors in staged situations to create ""false"" memories, to give viewers the feeling that they're living in an action film. Other BDs are simple recordings of a day in the life of the world's biggest and brightest stars. The ability to ""become"" a celeb and experience a life of luxury gives many a chance to escape their own miserable reality. As a result, braindance addiction has become an ever-growing problem for the city's poor. Also, as with all forms of entertainment media, illicit braindance recordings (XBDs) can be found easily in the seedy underbelly of Night City's black market.

What is the Braindance?
The braindance is similar in nature to the Netrunner's interface, in that it allows, via neural transmission, a person to fully and realistically experience an alternate reality. Unlike the interface a Netrunner uses, the perceptions are not created from the users brain, but rather from the recorded thoughts, memories, and physical sensations of another person.

Originally developed as a method of aversion programming for convicted criminals and later as a military simulator, the Braindance is one of the most popular form of entertainment.

Several companies, including DMS, Braindance Inc., and Home Braindance Organization, have many employees whose sole purpose is to go out and get involved in situations that normal people only dream of. As they confront these dangers, a technician records the entire experience and will later edit them for the viewing audience.

Once a suitable lenth chip has been compiled and edited, the chips and distributed to various locations for mass production.

The public has three ways to gain access to the Braindance:

The first is at an arcade: a multi-level room consisting of private booths in which a person can experience the Braindances which are currently being offered by the distribution service.
The second are the many bars which have one or two Black Boxes, and a subscribe to a distribution service.
The third and most expensive way is to buy your own Black Box and rent chips from an arcade or subscribe to a service yourself.
History of the Braindance
The Alternative Reality Process, or Braindance as it is more popularly known today, was invented by Yuriko Sujimoto, a graduate student at the University of California at Santa Cruz in 2007.

Using an extrapolated Moss equation, the basis for neural response translation, and a Netrunner interface as a base, Sujimoto managed to record her thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations into a standard information chip. When she plugged the chip back into the modified cybermodem she was using as a recorder, Sujimoto was able to experience what she had recorded in exact detail.

Upon receiving her PhD from Santa Cruz, Sujimoto went to work for the State of California as a researcher in penal reform. It was here that she and Norman Lassimer, a noted penal psychologist, began to realize the implications of her discovery as pertaining to penal reform.

Psychologists had often discussed the desire and need for criminal reprogramming. Many felt that a criminal had forfeited his or her rights upon breaking the law, and should therefore be subjected to adverse conditioning against the crime they had committed. On December 5, 2002, the Supreme Court, by unanimous vote, approved criminal reconditioning for certain ""anti-social"" crimes.

The victory was bittersweet, as reconditioning methods were primitive and generally ineffective until Sujimoto's discovery. With the introduction Of the Alternative Reality Process, psychological reconditioning could be rendered cheaply and effectively removing prisoners from the prison population. This Last point is what sold the State on this system. By reconditioning prisoners, the State could relieve the overcrowded prison conditions that existed.

In order to achieve the desired effect Of the Braindance, as most people were now referring to the Process, Lassimer and Sujimoto had to create a nightmare-like situation in which the offending subject would be placed. They reasoned the after aversion would come from the offender experiencing repeated instances of their crime being foiled and severe harm coming to the criminal in the attempt.

Though they had no database to work from, as few criminals were actually filmed committing a crime, and none whose sensory nerves were being rerouted into a recorder, the researchers were undaunted. After several setbacks, Lassimer and Sujimoto managed to convince the California State Senate to partially fund their project, and to offer sentence reduction for project volunteers. The final step in convincing the Senate came when Militech offered to help with the funding and offer jobs to those who were released early in exchange for a license to market the Braindance machines as a military simulator.

With the combined offers of Militech and the State of California, there were some ""volunteers,"" but not enough to compile one database, let alone the seven they wished to have. It would not be until March 7th, 2009, that their big break would come.

Harold D. MacLeroy, a convicted mass murderer, was due to be executed by the State when he made an unusual request: if Militech would give compensation to his family, then MacLeroy would allow himself to be killed while recreating one of the scripted crimes of Lassimer and Sujimoto. Once a set amount of money was agreed upon and a contract signed, MacLeroy allowed his death to be recorded.

Once the deal was announced, the general public became outraged at the nature of the bargain which MacLeroy struck, though Lassimer, Sujimoto and Militech felt it was a critical turning point for their project. They were correct. Soon thereafter, eight inmates who were scheduled to be executed within the year made similar agreements with Militech, and their deaths were recorded as well.

Although the initial database was smafuckthisgame"
1610033342,"It is definitely less ""open world"" than I expected it to be, but I am fully enveloped into the story and happy with the world build so far."
1610033339,"This game is quite bland and boring. It's not an RPG - the skill points you are able to spend don't make any real difference, you have no character development, all major decisions are made for you and the ones you take make hardly any difference. You can't even decide which clothes to wear, because they all have fricking stats and of course you want the highest ones, so you run around looking like a clown - not that it matters, because you hardly ever see your character anyway. You will meet hundreds of people, most of which you will have forgotten before you're out the door of their apartment - and it's almost always annoying to even get to them, because to get to person C, you will first have to meet person A, which will then tell you where B is, whose permission you need to get to C.
The game has a somewhat interesting main story - there are however major flaws in it. For example: it's not even your main story, it's for a huge part someone else's and you have to play as that person. And you will spend a LOT of time walking, talking, walking and talking, driving and talking, stumbling around because your character's software malfunctions, talking and explaining what happened while you were stumbling.. On a side note, you are forced to turn on subtitles, because without them you will not be able to understand when people are talking in Japanese, Korean or French.
The side missions are as plentiful as they are generic, consisting of variations on: get a thing, get a person, get a thing from a person, neutralize (read: gun down, because the stealth mechanics suck) small to middle groups of thugs. I tried completing them in two areas, but it was so repetitive and pointless that I stopped doing them altogether.
I completed the game in one of 6 very unsatisfying endings, but unlike the developers intended I was not interested at all to try the 5 other ones - I was glad that it was finally over."
1610033270,"i like the bugs theyre funny not game breaking and its my fouvorite game now so yhank you CDPR
"
1610033465,"TL;DR: Wait for a sale and until more patches come in and the game is stable.

The narrative of Cyberpunk 2077 is the soul element that carries the game. This is both why I've got over 30 hours on record with this game, and why I don't recommend anyone to buy it for 60$ as of this moment. I adore good narratives, stories, characters and CP 2077 has it all to offer. So, It was able to captivate me. If you do not care much for stories in video games or if this story specifically isn't quite your thing, CP 2077 will be at best a subpar video game for you. When I say the narrative is the soul element that carries the game, I am implying that everything else it has to offer is, to put it bluntly, pretty dull.

[h1][u]The Blatantly Bad[/u][/h1]
This game runs bad. I really don't want to spend too much time on this topic because I think most people know this by now. Most chances are you won't get a stable framerate, regardless of which settings you use. I am playing the game on medium settings, can reach 60 fps, but it is never stable. My computer is not a monster, but it's able to run any other AAA game with ease.

Other than that of course, there are a lot of bugs. The most common ones are objects clipping through each other and objects defying the rules of physics in general. These happen all the time and sometimes they can also happen at key story moments, ruining the immersion. While it's rare, I've also had multiple quests where I died because the quest wasn't able to continue until I reloaded my save and did it again. Considaring some of these quests do not allow you to save at certain points, I had to re-do decent chunks of content.

The game is playable for sure, but I think it's fair to expect more than just playable.

[h1][u]Can't Be Fixed With Patches[/u][/h1]
The gameplay is meh. You've seen better shooting in most games, you've seen overall better combat systems in most games, roleplaying mechanics, replayability value, choice & consequence, open world sandbox, so many things this game tries to do yet doesn't live up to the standards that many other games already achieved (years ago).

The ""open world"" is just a pretty backdrop filled with boring activites you won't bother to do which you drive through to get to the next quest you want to do and progress the story. It is beautiful and massive in scale (vertically too) but it's dead, mostly because you cannot interact with the world, anything you try doing makes it seem like you're breaking the game, especially when it comes to NPC Ai which reminds me of a Skyrim in Alpha state.

The biggest drawback is when you realize this game is not an rpg. You have a fixed character with a voice actor (terrible one if you're playing as male) that has its own personality for the most part. Yes, you can choose dialouge options, but they're not very varied and don't allow much player expression. Most dialogue is done through lines you are forced to say, becuase V will say them, V, who is not your character. V is also just a bad character in general, because it is pre-determined, but somehow they try to make him seem like you can control who he is a little bit, so he just comes off as inconsistent and artificial.

What about expressing your character through gameplay mechanics? Sure you can choose to play with a pistol or a sniper rifle, but the skill tree and the perks (Mostly stat upgrades that do not affect the way you play) don't really massively change the way you play the game, at the end of the day the role playing is like choosing to use an assault rifle or sniper rifle in Call of Duty. You just play what is more fun for you, like any other regular action game. Besides the combat is so boring and dull with horrible bullet sponge and dumb AI, that at most times you'll just want to rush through it anyway. Personally I did not play much with the hacking mechanics, because of this reason, they're just too complicated and take too long as opposed to just shoot your way through. Since I just didn't care for combat, that's what I preferred.

The game is not fun, it just gets in the way of the story. The story is good, but it's still a video game so you need to PLAY it.

[h1][u]Go Watch a Movie[/u][/h1]

After 30 hours I just got tired of dying randomly, going from point A to B, putting points into whatever I could in my skill tree without thinking, changing the difficulty to easy so I can just get through the game faster, bugs, bad framerate, and of knowing I have better games to play. The story is good but books and movies offer better stories. So no, I do not recommend this game, and even after they patch the technical problems, I wouldn't buy it at full price."
1610032767,"Hardly playable, unoptimized (r9 3900x+1080 ti), buggy mess. The amount of bugs is truly astonishing, pretty much every part of game is bugged, including main story quests and cutscenes. This should be marked ""early access"" and priced as such. 

I won't even talk about other parts of game, like braindead AI, poor skill tree, awful cars physics and etc. Yes, game world is beautiful. Yes, main story might be good. But it's too hard to enjoy game where everything is broken.

Come back in a year or so, samurai, where this game might actually be playable."
1610032555,i would sell my left testicle to buy this game

1610031993,"Yes there are bugs, but this game is amazing! Loved every minute if it so far :)"
1610031325,"Even though this game has some amazing elements and possesses an incredible story, I would suggest holding off on purchasing this game at full price. There are times when this game is buggy, which significantly takes away from a positive game play experience. There are times when boss encounters glitch out, or NPCs just appear out of nowhere. The driving in this game is absolutely terrible. I have a high performance PC and this game still has slow frame rates. At best, this game is a sub par version of GTA V, not a game that would change the gaming world as advertised... This reminds me of Anthem in the sense where there was a lot of hype that surrounded the game but when the time came to actually play it was quite sub par to say the least..."
1610031147,"Black screen after playing 30+ hours, suddenly game is not working after the start menu. Tried all forum entries from CDPR, Nvidia, Steam, to no avail. Running a 1090K/3090 setup, you should probably wait another 6 months for CDPR to resolve this mess."
1610031059,very nice game😎😎
1610030902,"poggers game
"
1610030897,"Despite its problems, i do wholefully enjoy the game. i hope that some changes are made to the AI, bounty system and other features to make this a great if not fantastic game. Is it worth the money? to me yes as i played cyberpunk 2020 the rpg. But thats for you to decide"
1610030567,Great game. Only wish it'll run smoother under the hood.
1610030398,"Lot's of bugs and few game breaking ones, but I still really like the game! Will be excellent after they fix everything."
1610030325,"Good game, the story and characters are really good. there were some bugs but nothing game breaking for me."
1610030298,My life has been ruined and my disappointment is immeasurable

coo game v coo"
1610030169,"wait for this game to go on sale, yall arent missing anything. 

Pros:
Cyberpunk lore

Cons:
Life Path you pick only last 15 mins into the game, you will be streetkid no matter what.
Game Randomly Crashes
Glitches & Bugs 
Poor NPC AI (GTA 5 almost 10 year old game has way better AI)
Weak RPG elements
Difficulty on very hard isnt very hard 
Pooly optimized game. running 2080 ti rtx with SSD running high settings average 70-40 FPS. Ultra ray tracing settings 60-30 FPS.
Game plays like dead island and dying light.


First CDprojektRed game pretty disappointed."
1610029891,"The game is in unacceptable state:

- unpolished
- unfinished
- unoptimized
- tons of bugs
- AI is braindead and insulting
- missing content and mechanics

Maybe i will change my opinion after major updates and patches are implemented. Current state is insultingly unacceptable. It was rushed. I feel sorry for the dev team... I can't blame them."
1610030151,"Like The Game but, 

Quality itself is Very Far Below the Witcher 3 Wild Hunt.
  
Playstyle is like GTA V (Driving Car) + Watch Dogs (Hacking) + Metal Gear (Stealth) Ripp off.
what RPG?
The Main Story is Good (with all Bad Ending, --> it's a game, so please make some nice ending, no need to make all kind of Tragic End)
for the Secondary Story 50% Good 50% Bad.
  

Note,
CDPR please , 
Hurry up make a DLC or Sequel with Another New Stories of Merc.
--> let V died in Peace"
1610029778,"Yes, I would recommend this game to others but with these caveats. It's SUPER, SUPER, SUPER SHORT!!!! My guy beat the game and I never even got to see anything other than mid-grade gear. I kept looking, all game, at all these fancy things I'd get to use later on only for the game to end abruptly. The game is pretty buggy, spacial awareness on 3K is seriously lacking. I had to jump around, stand or crouch and move around just to pick things up. Many items were still marked as there that were already picked up. The worst part of the game by far!!! Dialogue...endless dialogue, go talk to this person, follow this person, walk very slowly for a long time while skipping the entire 10 minutes conversation; in this regard Cyberpunk was a joke. 

I'm pretty let down at how short and easy the game was, how the side missions were so confusing and you never know how much or what you're going to get from them to grinding money just isn't possible. 

The game, honestly, is a huge disappointment but, if you're like me, and love Cyberpunk x1000000 then even this disappointment feeds a little part of you. I'd recommend it based on that and good graphics."
1610029512,"Cool game
"
1610029222,Bugs aside the games sick
1610029135,super fun game love it.
1610029063,It's got bugs but it's still fun as hell well worth the 60 usd
1610028969,"I liked it. yes there are bugs, but if you look away from broken promise it is still a very enjoyable game"
1610028881,GuD GaM mY GiRl hAS a PeEn
1610028817,"Quite some bugs like most people know, but I really enjoyed my 100 hours played. Just waiting on updates and DLCs and awaiting even better game."
1610028717,"there are 2 enjoyment methods of this game 1: bring this game to its goddamn knees as you laugh to death at the fact that all the enemies are t posing and are slowly flying and 2: ignore the bugs as you play the full game because the story is better than the entirety of disney star wars. this game has the greatest story in any game ive played other than red dead 2. my pc can barely handle this game and yet its story carries it to greatness. does this game live up to the unreal hype that made this game iconic, in a way yes but fuck no. while it did do everything it said it would do, it does it all with exceptional mediocrity or too much polish. 8/10, good game with greatest story but has major issues."
1610028651,"Nice open world FPS game set in the future. Lacks some of the polish that the Deus Ex series has, but makes up for it with the story, size of the map and scope of the game."
1610028594,"Bugs can be bad, I havent experienced nearly the quantity that people are claiming, different playthrough, different experiences. Overall the game is enjoyable and worth playing."
1610028591,"I've played more than 40Hours already.

The game is amazing, i love it.
The story isn't over yet. I'm doing a lot of Side Jobs and gigs. 
Side jobs are amazing. Already done Panam Story arc, working on another arc and with side gigs.
The game is very little buggy nothing game breaking. Floating cigarette or NPC sitting in a wall nothing major.
I recommend this game i love it."
1610028448,"Having an absolute blast. On PC the glitches (for me) are far and wide between.

Love it. Can't wait for the DLCs."
1610028320,besides the visual bugs and the random soft locks that the game has it has a lot of potential. also panam is best girl.
1610027940,"great game, I expirienced no major issues"
1610027791,"Don't believe everything you read. There is a lot of hysteria surrounding this game concerning bugs and it not living up to expectations. I can't speak for console versions, but on the PC playing via steam on a reasonably high spec computer it is a joy. I've noticed barely any bugs, and have had a great time with it so far. It may be fun for some to jump on the bandwagon and bash this game, but my own experience has been very positive and I heartily recommend it."
1610027782,Not great. There are a whole lot of bugs and other issues with the game right now.
1610027650,youll need a better PC then you think and dont treat it as a open world game but more of a deus ex kind of RPG
1610027618,amazing game. just not for those who can't understand that they have a terrible console
1610027427,Glitchy but beautiful
1610027319,"I'm not mad, just disappointed."
1610027252,"Though I love this game I can't recommend it after completing everything there is, their is little to do after the story, the side gigs and police scans are good but limited, after completing them there is nothing to do, exploring the city shows how unfinished the game is, I found a stadium and casino that you cant get into, they are huge landscape features that feel like huge cut content pieces. There's no challenge in the game and replaying the endings is a drag with multiple unskipable parts.  Until there is more content play your other games"
1610027165,"personally only glitch i have seen is on the one occasion when i snapped a criminals neck, as i thew them in the bin they were still talking to there fellow criminal even as i was closing the lid on there garbage coffin. It only made the game even more enjoyable highly recommend."
1610026992,"Nice world, horrible AI"
1610026750,"Alright so there have been a lot of controversial stuff going around with this game, but i'll just say the the level of immersion this game provides is beyond epic especially the story is really great along with all it's side gigs and mission, plus points for giving a chance to meet Keanu Reeves"
1610026593,"Ok, so this review i am going to bypass anything related to exceptionally poor release and management, because that is company stuff, and we are not here to review the company.

what do i rate it in numbers: i would give it a solid, 7/10

Why?
Well the title is fantastic in terms of what is aiming to be shown to us, a dystopian future where gangs are many, people are plenty and cybernetics are common, the game does this really well, graphically when the game isn't bugging out and rendering people without faces looks legitimately amazing, but the game itself looks too ""Clean"", and i am not talking about trash, i mean it feels too light, too well maintained, sure you can go out of the main city and see some sh** but there isnt enought ""Dirt"" in the city. (I know what i mean but its hard to explain so sorry if that doesn't make sense)

Gunplay and murder death killing:
Ok so in general, the combat is fun and very entertaining, i mean who does not enjoy blowing off limbs and hacking people - literally and metaphorically, but whist it is fun, once you have played it for a while you see things that start to griding on you, like lazy and often stupid AI, aiming not being quite right even if you are perked up, a VERY VERY BAD DPS increase as you level up to something that would be considered godlike, i mean i got to level i think 20 and got myself a nice pistol that just 1hko people.

Story:
I cant fault the story really, but i do think it was a ""Rush to the ending"" sorta thing, meaning that the buildup was too fast, it went from ""I am a freelance merc doing strange jobs"" to suddenly "" I AM A TERRORIST GUNNA DO TERRORISTY THINGS"" even if you chose not to do those sorts of things, you still did those things anyway, and johnny, well, i love him to bits but even that development between character and him, was a sudden change from ""I WANNA KILL YOU"" to *SPOILER*

Control functions:
Did not have any issues with this, and no real standout points either, worked fine.

Overall/tl:dr

The game is DEFINITELY worth your money, sure it's plagued with bugs, seemingly missing content and strange occurances, but if you can look past all of that, you will have a wonderful time, hacking, slashing, solving and running, mostly running

Just do not get in a car, they drive like a drunk."
1610026417,very fun
1610026305,"keanu reeves say's ""impressive cock"" that's all."
1610026049,Sure the game is buggy but it feels like one of the most ambitious games I've ever played. The quality is there and the game is fun.
1610025934,"CDPR crafted an unpolished masterpiece. 
Despite a very bumpy launch and quite some funny and enjoyable glitches (nothing game breaking IMO) the game is so much fun and the story is really awesome! The amount of passion and love that was poured into this game is insane! 
I'll be waiting for the next big updates for me to do my next walkthrough."
1610025812,"Good. Recommend. 
:)"
1610025609,I had no expectations as I didint know anything before hand but I think the game is fucking amazing I had no issues what so ever to run it nor did I run into any bugs the story and the game are amazing
1610025552,"For the money not worth it. Looks amazing but, story line is way to short. Too many side jobs, those should have been put into the story line."
1610025457,.
1610025420,"I had almost no serious glitches or bugs, but the story started off soooo strong. But at a certain point the story just went to shit. The story in this game starts out so well and then it just sucks. I finished the main story and then immediately deleted the game."
1610025387,"Really liked the game, it has some bugs and overall gameplay problems but i found mysefl having a lot o fun exploring NC and it's characters. It's not the greatest game ever made and honestly i think it is inferior than other games CDPR released like TW3, but still, i liked the story and found it to be very creative in some aspects.
Recomend that everyone try it and make their own opinions on the game."
1610025163,Needs a good old polishing but damn I do love this game
1610025161,"Luckily i never got on the hype train for this game. Yes, it is buggy but i have fallen inlove with the world CD-projekt red built. Would absolutely recommend this game."
1610024891,It happened to have some bugs on release? So what? It is a masterpiece! Should be GOTY.
1610025153,"Welcome to Cyberpunk 2077. A rushed, half-assed product that brings little to nothing new to it's players. It's an open world game with a lot to see - yet nothing to find. The story is short but sweet. It has depth and great characters. 

[u] POSITIVES [/u] 
[list]
[*]Great story. Involves some ethical dilemmas and makes you feel - to some degree - connected to V.
[*]Great characters. It's a pleasant experience to connect and get to know the main characters throughout storylines.
[*]Cool environments. A pretty game, for sure. 
[/list]

[u] NEGATIVES [/u]
[list]
[*]AI and NPC's. They somehow managed to make the most braindead AI I've seen since the early 2000's. GTA IV's AI and NPC behaviour beats Cyberpunk 2077 by miles. That's just tragically comical for a company that promised to revolutionize the way we see open world games. It breaks immersion and looks lazy with the standards that are in place.

[*]Open world is empty. It's a cool place to lay your eyes upon at first, but when I got into exploring the world, I was left wanting. There's just not anything interesting to find on the map. I've stumbled upon one easter egg throughout my 77hr playthrough. That's it. If you're looking for a good open world game that rewards exploration, you'll have more fun watching grass grow.

Barely any buildings in the open world are actually accessible, nearly everything is locked. You'd expect to be able to at least explore the lonely buildings of the Badlands region, since the they're so far and few between. Even THEY are locked. Just terrible.

[*]Repetetive side jobs and quests. It's crazy how much of this games filler jobs and quests are straight up copy/paste. Besides the main story and the side characters storylines, this game is just a repeating series of encounters until you've cleared them from the map.
[/list]

To conclude - this game is garbage in comparison to market standards and the promises that CDPR gave during marketing. Do not buy it at the current price of 60€. It is not nearly a finished game. But in 6 months it might be the best game on the market, depending on how much slavery CDPR executives forces upon the developers. At the moment, this game is worth about 20€ - since it's clearly an alpha version of the game they set out to make."
1610024505,not as bad as people say. its actually good.
1610025233,"This game is nothing what CD Red promised us, Thats why i can not recommend this game. The best way to describe game feels like something ubisoft would make, like the assassin creed games or the far cry games. Not horrible games but games that tend to be pretty simple and repetitive. Games you'll only probably play through once then wait for the next one to return to the series.  Cyberpunk tents to feel the same.

 This wouldnt be that much of a problem if CD red didn't lie about delivering a next gen experience, they're is nothing next gen about this game. CD red really needed to take a page from rockstars book with Red dead redemption 2. with its small interactions and details make the game feel so amazing and fleshed out. Cyberpunk tries to do this fails.

The bugs have been a big issues too but they can be fixed, but it wont change how shit the actual game works compared to what they promised. This is not a next gen game. This game needed at least another 1-3 years of polish. The ideas they had for this game were very ambitious but executed so wrong. 

The shooting of guns itself feels good but the bullet sponge nature of the enemies makes it feel like nerf guns at times. The driving as well feels pretty good when it works well but the physics in this games will cause so many glitches like causing your car to go flying after hitting a garbage bag or some sort of prop. All of the AI is terrible, it feels like Ai you'd get from a game from 15 years ago. Even playing on hard difficultly once to get half decent gear you can just cheese most fights. I really did enjoy the story telling but even that was lacking a little bit at times. The stealth in this game is a joke. Customisation felt very limiting. 

This might just be me but i feel like the dashboard of most cars are to high to drive well in first person, forcing me to drive in third person. Feel i need a booster seat when driving. This is such a shame because driving around in first person listening to the radio is an awesome feeling.

I really do hope they try and make a sequel and truly deliver on what they intended because the very few moments when this game got it right it was awesome. But i only got that feeling a few times towards the beginning, the more you play the worse it gets. 

This game isnt 100% horrible but the glaring issues just makes it hard to talk about this game positively. Do not think of this as a next gen game.  I still think this game is worth a play though when a lot of the bugs are gone but even then lower your expectations of it, and defiantly dont pay full price."
1610023962,WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY
1610023832,Great game with an incredible story. My PC is 3 years out of date and runs it perfect.
1610023354,"Waste of money.   Conned out of $90   The open world implementation is so poor it breaks all immersion.  Compared to the GTA series, Cyberpunk has no immersion in the open world.  Every single aspect lacks detail.  It just looks pretty.   The last GTA game came out 7 years ago."
1610022896,BEST GAME EVER i LOVWE IT LAOODS
1610022736,Buggy unfinished game a lot of what was promised is not in the game.
1610022502,"Very good experience in open world driving around and exploring, either is in the city or badlands, with very difrent types of cars to chose from. Good storyline that you can shape according to your character and tons of sidemissions with tons of enemies to obliterate, and you only need to choose ""one"" of the difrent types of weapons to do it. Overall its more than worth and fells good to play it!"
1610021547,"I am not going to pretend that the bugs are not there or that this is an optimized game.

Bugs aside, I get 35-55 FPS in the city , with everything on full on a 3090 with 9900k (!!!) on both 2K and 4K resolutions, never seen this before in a game that different resolutions produce the same frame rate. 

That being said, I enjoyed the main story and main side quests. There's lots of work that needs to be done to consider this a AAA game. If you haven't bought this, wait until the sales in a year or two, it should be cheaper and fixed by then."
1610021540,"i've played for 4 hours. im 100% qualified to give an accurate review of this game. thank you for giving me this opportunity. i promise you i will not disappoint you in my extended and accurate game review.

my PC is trash and im lucky if i got 30fps most of the time.

1610020786,"Obviously a good game, but it has a bunch of issues. 

1) Vehicles handle weird. 
2) It is super difficult to find an outfit that doesn't make you look like a clown. 
3) The AI is bad. 
4) Quite a few odd bugs. 
5) Game is overwhelming and confusing. Very slow introduction into the game world, and it takes a while before you ""get it"" - in the meantime, you get bombarded with missions and jobs with no real chance of keeping track of these. 

That said - solid shooter/slasher with decent stealth mechanics and some interesting concepts in the mix. As an RPG, I feel like it doesn't matter much what you choose in the game, but you get to make dialogue choices, so I guess that's something? 

"
1610020558,"The typical Cyberpunk 2077 experience: You've just entered an enemy base, there's 15 gun toting and katana wielding gangsters who have been alerted to your presence and they come at you like a swarm. You check your inventory, all you have is some low grade pistols and your cybernetically enhanced fists... no problem. You activate your beserk implant absorbing all of the initial fire and rush at the nearest enemy, he has no time to react, all he can do is look in horror before your fist goes through his face. A couple of minute is all it take for you to pummel them all into the ground, loot their corpses and complete your objective. As you're walking out you happen to see an rare gun on a large box, you step on a foot high box in order to reach it, you slip and land on your back, you flatline...you throw your keyboard through your monitor."
1610032680,This game is a huge disappointment
1610020024,its fun
1610020002,"I never played any of the Witcher games, so I have been immune to much of the hype around this game. I had seen it at a few video game events a few years back, but not much else... 

I've seen a lot of talk about how it sucks on last-gen consoles, and how it is full of bugs and cut content... but honestly, after 90 hours on a Dell XPS 15 laptop, I haven't had any game-breaking issues. 

I've seen a few bodies rubberband or disapear, seen a few cars randomly explode, and experienced a few times where the game thought I fell 50 feet when I stepped off a small ledge... but most of the bugs have been laughable and added some comic relief to the game. 

Overall it is a good game that is unpolished and needs some more work. This could easily be done in patches and hotfixes. Things such as only being able to craft 1 grenade at a time instead of typing 100 and pressing the button once. Things such as having trouble 'locking on' to items to pick up when they are half hidden. Things such as vending machines running out of soda and still charging me 10 eddies while im spamming the buy button so I can dismantle them to craft a pink frilly jacket to sell to the vendor. 

There is a really fun game, with really great gameplay systems, but its in its awkward puberty phase, and has a few too many pimples... 

Overall Rating: Addicted, but my girlfriend hasn't broken up with me yet
Graphics: Looks good on my mid-range laptop
Gameplay: Really fun, but my Netrunner is way OP even on hardest difficulty
Story: Pretty good, but I still haven't finished it.

Oh yeah right, to see the reviews of this game."
1610019859,Runs well if you have good pc else wait for optimisation updates
1610019666,Despite the bugs and glitches i haven't really encountered anything truly game breaking and truthfully i have been really enjoying this game.
1610019638,Thank you kindly
1610019588,"I loved night city and its history. However, there are many, many bugs right now that detracted me from my  experience with the game, I Hope they will be fixed asap. Another thing to note: I felt the game was quite short, even though I pushed through all of the side missions (except River's). This game could use a dlc."
1610019528,"I can't write no essay but I will say that this game is fucking beautiful. I can say that cause I've dropped 166 hours so far. Loved Johnny's character and V, will defs take a while to get down from the high of finishing the game."
1610019521,"There are better games to put your money on. Still, it´s unique."
1610019482,"Yes, the game has issues, but at Patch 1.06 on PC (!) none of them seriously kept me from enjoying my play, and now I finished the main story and I am deeply moved, gotta sit back and take a deep breath for a bit. 

It's an obvious game to compare to The Witcher 3 and many things feel very familiar when you've played Geralt. Where many people have said that the main story of TW3 pales compared to some of the side quests, IMO it's the other way around in CP2077, though that does not mean there aren't intriguing or even disturbing side-quests in CP2077, it's just not every other one. And that also means I still have a lot more to do with V, now, after finishing the main story, than I usually have in TW3.

By the time this game gets to patch level 1.31 I'm sure people will love or hate the game for many of the same reasons they love or hate TW3. 

My minor gripes were:
- Considering that you're kinda making your own character, I sometimes just didn't have the dialog options I was looking for
- Driving cars with mouse/KB is a pain, motorcycles can be enjoyable (consequently I didn't participate in any races.)
- I had to reload an older save because of glitched quests exactly twice in 146 hrs of gameplay. Didn't like that, but ... just save often.

Other than that? I will continue playing, and I would buy it again."
1610019372,"Story is really good, bugs are minimal in PC version, visuals are gorgeous, Must try RTX"
1610019175,too much bug and glitches even for the side quest. wish i could refund
1610019009,lmao no
1610018894,its great story and fun to be had with the silly moments but as far a single player world where you can be anything most you get is nudity all good and all but wheres the fight rings the pubs theclubs the random encounters anything its just side missions and god level police
1610018878,"Great game, great world and character building, a solid story. Have some little bugs and glitches in many places, but nothing is game breaking. Love it."

1610019040,"[b][u]Wake up Samurai, we have a city to break.[/u][/b]

Well, that's the end of my 1st Run. 66hrs later (really 70), with 90% of the things done in game (only the blue repeatables remain). It was a helluva ride, full of excitement and hard moments, interesting decisions and lots of mayhem.

When the game came out, many jumped to praise or condemn it immediately, with not even 2hrs gameplay. The short-sightedness of those people, especially in media is astonishing. Anyone with a decent PC can run this game perfectly, I had zero issues (once solving a small bug with memory overflow on the hardware side) with the game's performance.

But you've come to read this as a review; and I have to say in the words of Mark Anthony; 

[b]""I have come to bury Caesar, not praise him.""[/b]

We will start with the good, obvious spoilers ahead:

[list]
    [*]The Story was amazing, it really is a spiritual successor to the tabletop RPG Cyberpunk 2020, where apparently Johnny's exploits are canon now! Jackie, Judy, Panam, River, Rogue were awesome, every single story mission was kickass, especially the ending(s).
    [*]The main characters were fully realized, 3D Characters with their own quirks and traits, loved each big sidequest they had.
    [*]Keanu Reeves proves once more that he's breathtaking. Johnny is a really complex character (too Marxist at times tho xD).
    [*]There were plenty of things to do, loads of sekrit locations, much loot and a fully realized world, Night City looks awesome.
    [*]Quests were plenty and always had something to do. V must have gotten like 12hrs of sleep overall, since I'd find myself questing all day in-game (and out of it lol).
    [*]Graphics were astonishing, the game is a technological experiment when it comes to graphics and storytelling, I am sure most FPS RPG's of the future will have dynamic cutscenes like Cybperpunk. It's one of the most awesome features I've seen in a game. 
    [*]As for retention, the game kept me coming back for more. Still in lockdowns, this game gives solace to the boredom of all day inside. After you level up to 25 and have OP items, the game becomes a power fantasy and I love it, especially when adding all the references, memes and callbacks inside the game.
    [*]Adding on the above point, every combo of skills/perks is viable, you can really play however you like, open-ended! You can really break the game with insane DPS (110K Katana with Berserker).
    [*]The game had few fun glitches, no bugs encountered, and run smoothly.
[/list]

As always, there's some bad stuff coming. Nothing in life is perfect. 

[list]
    [*]We need the cut content back; I'd love to be able to purchase locations, loot every building, do in-game changes to my character's appearance and more. Please CD bring it back.
    [*]Methinks, someone wanted to skip the Adult rating on the game, there's less promiscuity, sex, drugs (and Rock n' Roll) on this game than the tabletop; it's especially bad when you see the trailers and the in-game clothes.
    [*]Driving is like dancing on an ice-skate ring, please fix.
    [*]We need more time with the main characters, especially in romance. Only one romantic scene with Panam/Judy and that's all? 
    [*]Some more cohesion would go a long way in the story, especially with sidequests; they could play a bigger impact in the game. 
[/list]

As you can see, there main issues stem from the finer details. I think with a few patches, DLC and tweaks the game will be a masterpiece to go back and play time and time again. Personally, I will do a 2nd Run after some time. You really ought to take your time after the ending. It was great fun!

[b]Overall Rating: 9/10, GG CD Projekt Red![/b]"
1610082674,"Look, I didn’t enter into Cyberpunk 2077 thinking that by the end of the game I would be living a life of contentment with another. I went to Night City to kill things. That was the plan. But plans change. My intention was never to wh*re myself out almost immediately, but that is how the cards fell and I just rolled with it. The incident - as I like to refer to it, as it shapes every other experience that would come after it - occurred quite early in my forays into Night City. Meredith Stout! You heartless b**ch. I basically whored myself out to her within the first hour. It started like any relationship starts. She wanted someone dead, I liked killing things so it was a match made in heaven, at least I thought. I did find her to be rather abrupt in her dealings with me, especially during the debriefing (at one point I was considering capping her myself) as she had basically lied to me about the entire mission and now I didn’t have the blood of one person on my hands, I had the blood of a hundred. Whatever, I liked to kill things so the more blood the merrier.

The debriefing didn’t go too well and I figured she hated my guts. Truth be told after that meeting I wasn’t too keen on her either. Then out of a Night City blue, I get a call from her while aimlessly wandering the streets of Night City looking for things to murder. The message was cryptic and brief, to meet at the No Tell Hotel for some important ""sharing"" of intel. Now that I think back the name No Tell Hotel should have already sparked off alarm bells in my head but what do I know I am a stupid Merc. When I arrived she was in her bra and panties which struck me as odd attire to conduct a business meeting in, but hey whatever this is the future, 2077 to be in fact.  I soon found out I was just there to be her play thing. She pounced like a lion before I could make any objections and ravaged me there and then. I left No Tell Hotel with feelings I just couldn’t shake, had I just been used and abused? I immediately started to rationalise it, my thoughts pooling like a sticky white mess as I eagerly anticipated our next tryst at the next seedy motel while also signing up at victim.com. I figured she was a woman of power, obviously she needed this to validate herself, and I could happily play along.  She never did call me again! I was so crestfallen. It felt like my heart had been ripped out from my chest  and fed to the ungrateful homeless of Night City. In my anger I quickly took to the streets of Night City to murder things.

As time passed, I soon met a lovely girl called Panam. I really digged this chick. She was a girl after my own murderous heart. Adventurous, free-spirited, full of zest and spunk (clearly life hadn't beaten her down a notch or two yet), perhaps a little too naive for my tastes, but most importantly she loved to kill things, particularly other members of other nomadic tribes. I told myself this could only end in bliss. One night the perfect opportunity arose. A picknick with her  and her friends under the stars. That night I tried my hardest to romance the ground right out from under her as her mates strummed along on some guitars while we all sat around a gorgeous wood fire. Had the stars truly aligned? Had my moment of truth finally arrived? I mean come on who wouldn’t want to shag under these circumstances? The atmosphere, the environment and the tunes where all intoxicating and I imagined they were getting her all hot, sweaty and bothered (because I was definitely feeling hot, sweaty, and bothered). Then at one point she put her head on my shoulder.  Bingo! I think we have a winner.

Surely this was it? From now on she would fold like chocolate into my arms and we would kiss passionately and then f**k like rabbits under the stars. With her head resting on my shoulder, I took that as my cue and made my first advance. Well shock, horror, dismay, she immediately friend-zoned me. I slowly curled my tongue back into my mouth sheepishly. How had I read all the signs incorrectly? Isn't friendship even more of a serious commitment? Should I leave breadcrumbs? Now I deeply respect a woman's choices and I would never ever want to put them in positions they were not comfortable with but I won't lie if my poor little heart didn't fall straight to the bottom of my feet. It was like walking around with slippers made out of cast iron. I was wounded. I needed to get the f**k out of there and fast.

We eventually did f**k, but it wasn't the kind of sex I was expecting. It was weird. No it was bat-sh*t crazy. It involved getting all hot and sweaty inside a tank as we blew things up. Now I don’t mind a bit of killing during my sex but this was getting ridiculous. We were wiping out entire clans while climaxing. The more I touched the tanks dipstick to rotate us, or pressed a button to fire a barrage of missiles onto a helpless village, the more excited she got. I wasn't sure if she was making love to me or the contraption. I have a sneaky feeling it was the metal beast because she never called again. To be honest that was a bit mental even for my tastes. If she calls again I might answer, I might not.

Then I met the delectable doll called Judy but she was having none of my advances. It was immediate that this relationship would settle into that of big brother/ little sister quite early on and no amount of advances that I made would have any bearings on her tide. Turns out she is lesbian and that is a big problem because I am a man. I immediately started to think about where I could find the nearest ripperdoc. Could they perform sex reassignment surgery I wondered to myself? To be honest I respect her too much to go through with that operation. I am quite happy that she looks up to me like an older brother and I wouldn’t want to change that for the world, even if it meant her looking up to me as an older sister. I decided there and then that gender reassignment surgery was off the cards for me.

Since my relationships with the fairer sex hasn't been going well, I have decided the perfect foil for me is Detective River Ward. We met over the killing of Night Cities mayor but I couldn't give a rats ass about who killed this stupid mayor, especially when this detective keeps oogly-eyeing me with that one delectable eye of his. I am not sure what happened to his other eye, we haven't broached that topic yet so stop trying to pester me for answers dammit, can't you see that I have fallen hopelessly in love and that this should simply be good enough? WHO CARES IF HE HAS ONLY ONE EYE? I DON'T!  I am even entertaining helping him look for his missing nephew just to get closer to him. That little ungrateful sh*t of a nephew better had not gotten himself killed because then this could definitely turn out to be the nadir in our relationship and I will be madder than a box of frogs. 

I think he likes me. While his words are telling me one thing, his puppy-dog eye is telling me something very different. It speaks of satin sheets, soft caresses and volcanic climaxes...okay maybe I am getting a bit ahead of myself here. He has even invited me to dinner tonight with his sister. YES HIS SISTER!!! You don’t just invite friends or strangers over to family dinners if you don’t plan on shagging them right?  Look, I don't think I will be able to handle rejection yet again, so this had better be the one. Detective River Ward has been flirting with me so often that I almost slipped right out of my undies a few times so If by some token I have gotten this all wrong, I am going to pull out my perfectly calibrated schlong and jab him in the only good eye he has got left. Then I will probably shoot him, and his sister. 

There is that other problem of how he likes to solve crimes while I like to commit them but hey we will cross that bridge when we get there. There is also that  issue about a construct wedged in my brain slowly killing me, but I don't want to worry his pretty little head over such trivialities."
1610018217,"1. SUMMARY
2. ABOUT THE GAME
3. THE CONS
4. ABOUT BUGS

1. SUMMARY:
8.5 / 10 points, for a Game that is a Witcher version of GTA5. 
After 75 hours, finishing the main campaign, 2 of the endings and nearly all side quests done, I can definitely recommend the game. (on PC) Definitely a Game were you invest enough time to replay parts of the game just to get the character ending you prefer.
I will surely come back for more after a break, and eagerly await the promised free DLC.

For safety, give it a few months for patches, then buy it without regret.

2. ABOUT THE GAME
Story is well done but nothing amazing, yet still deep enough to interest. The Witcher 3 wipes can definitely be felt with very personal conversations and sometimes gruesome quest lines. The side quest are often a highlight and should definitely be played to enjoy the full depth of the world.
I would best describe it as a version between GTA5 and Witcher 3. 

The deep story and immersion of Witcher, combined with the sandbox city play of GTA. It doesn't reach the height of Witchers storytelling, but comes close to it, and substitutes it with much improved combat system and RPG features. 

The design of the open world is beautiful, not only on a graphical level, but the attention to details and immersive environments are incredible. GTA in comparison has feels bland and shallow, a surface world to toy around in. Cyberpunks clustered environments, musics, sounds, language intakes, advertisements paint a breathtaking picture. 

A massive array of sounds support this environment. It is astonishing to find frequent English, Japanese, French, Spanish, Russian and other languages mixed into the world, into natural and large amount. It is natural to hear Japanese jingles on one street corner while hearing some characters swearing in Spanish on the next. I could not find another game that uses such a scale of immersive sounds to make a world come alive.

Gameplay wise its a massive improvement above both, Wither3 and GTA. Witcher3 had a frankly wonky hack-and-slay combo gameplay that never managed to be really responsive or dense as the Souls series. Same for GTA, who's 3rd person combat is serviceable, but lacks deeper immersion and weight. Cyberpunk is not revolutionary by any means, but uses a very solid FPS gameplay with a good variety of tools to do the job.

Speaking of tools. GTA never had any RPG and Witcher was very limited on Gerald, his 6 magic abllities and 2 sword with a leather armor. Cyberpunk on the other hand offers a similar variety of weapons to GTA, but with upgrade features, plus armor system and an actuall skilltree. Plus further upgrades to your characters physique. 

Characters are generally great. The main character is somewhat bland, which makes sense considering you can create your character freely. But the second main character, Johnny Silverhand, is not as good as he could be. 
On the other hand, side characters like Panam, Rivers, Judy, Claire, Peralez have great stories to tell, that are not only great to get into the world, but also in Witcher style gut wrenching at times. From personal Vendettas, to races, to investigations, these side stories really make the game next to the main missions and will want to see the other possible ends to the game. 

About decisions, some people complained that they don't matter. And yes, they mostly don't except a few. But then again, there is nearly no RPG out there were it does. Not in Mass Effect, nor GTA, nor AC, nor Witcher for that matter. Thats just how RPGs are. So no complain from me.

3. THE CONS:
1. Music: My biggest grippe. While the sound environment is great, the music playlist of the game is frankly bad, uninspired and not very enjoyable to listen to. While GTA had great classics playing on the car radio, and Witcher has a beautiful score for combat and for the environment, Cyberpunk has neither. However it does overall a serviceable job to set the scene with good enough music to not break immersion during quests. Other scores are usually from the genres of Death Metal, Punk, Electro and such, that match the world theme, but are rather unpleasant to listen too. And the few scores that are good, are badly balanced to really feel an impact. 
2. Driving. Its not great, not horrible, but could be better.
3. Loot system. Too much pointless loot, same as the newer assassins creed. Most will become trash.
4. No character changes after the start of the game, not even a haircut.
5. Little interaction with the world outside of Quests, such as in GTA through buying apartments, or body building, stunt drives etc.
6. The backgrounds don't really matter. For me its not a bigger issue, but it is still a little weird to even offer the option if it means so little to the game.
7. Usual open world Comfort features are missing. Like a radar map that is further away when driving. A hairdresser. Overlay outfits. etc.
8. Controller support. No aim assist, pretty wonky. 
9. Bugs, yeah. Wait a little.

4. ABOUT BUGS:
Are there bugs? Yes. Most of them HUD bugs that can be solved by simply saving and reloading, or stuck sound etc. Nothing that occurs regularly. I have not meet any game breaking bugs during my playthrough, and only suffered 3 crashes in 75 hours.
Personally I was positively surprised after the raving reviews of a bugfest. In my experience the PC version was alright.

Some things definitely need tweaking though. Some armor upgrades seem not to fully work, and many skills are not balanced enough, so that its is easily possibly to achieve ridiculous damage multipliers to one-hit kill nearly all enemies. It is possible to create infinitive resources by simply crafting and earning unlimited money without cheating or using glitches. Just by using badly balanced features.
As this is a single player game this is not a bigger issue, but it is still something QA should have picked up on.

================
Overall though, I recommend it, and will come back for more, latest with DLC or just to finally reach max level."

1610018048,"Cyberpunk 2077 je naprosto geniální.

Hra má výborný příběh, vedlější mise nejsou nudné a hlavně vás hra zcela pohltí. Výběr perků je obrovský a je jen na vás jakým stylem chcete hru hrát. Zabít nepřátele z dálky? Naběhnout na ně jako by to byla vaše poslední možnost? Je to jen na vás. Já třeba zbožňuji, když použijete na nepřátele hack sebevražda či nákaza a jen se z povzdálí díváte jak pomalu a bolestivě umírají.

Bugy ve hře nějaké jsou, ale po vydání opravného patche se hra hraje velmi dobře. S optimalizací nemám nejmenší problémy a pokud se nějaký ten bug najde, tak vám to zážitek ze hry opravdu nezkazí.

Hru rozhodně doporučuji všem, kteří mají rádi rpg hry, budoucnost, nespočet rozhodovacích možností  a romantícké scény. A rádio opravdu běhěem jízdy po Night City nevypínejte!"
1610017853,"if you havn't bought the game yet then i would wait, the game is good but not what was promised. i havnt played other CD project reds games but i am disapointed in this game."
1610017846,"Very, very bug ridden and alot of issues, but if you are willing to look beyond that, you will enjoy this game as I have. If the technical issues put you off this game I would understand but I am pretty sure these issues will disappear over time and the devs dont seem like the individuals to give up. I am satisfied with my purchase and when this game is fixed up and given a fresh coat of paint, im sure you will too"
1610017248,"This is probably hands down one of the best games I've ever played (and I've played my share). I'm not even a fan of first person shooters. But this has the immersion of Mass Effect, a great sense of humor, fantastic art, most side-quests actually feel 'fun' and creative instead of the same fetch / kill thing re-skinned, the story is properly aimed at adults (in-depth character development, topics that really make you think, not shy about going into dark dark places that make you properly want to hurt some folk, nudity that doesn't really seem forced or gratuitous so much as saying 'hey, you're an adults, lets treat you like one'), it is actually cyberpunk (dystopian outlook that takes jabs at modern events / culture and direction and captures that whole 'punk' mentality), and I just can't say enough good things about it.

Is it 'perfect'? Of course not. I hear the console folk are having trouble (sorry 'bout that - but this is a Steam review and I've had almost zero bugs that really mattered - and when I did they were fixed with a simple reload from quick save). And I'm sure some stuff got cut out and will come out as DLC. But given the sheer scale of this game, and that it is an open-ended scale with rich characters and that whole 'just 5 more minutes, just one more quest, I just gotta do one more thing..' sensation.... Seriously, it is easily worth the price. Oh, and no microtransactions, no crap drm EA weirdness, it just works and works well.

I should say something bad too. 
* Mmm.. your character goes into a t-pose sometimes at high speeds for a few flashes of a second. Eh, who cares. 
* The relationships could have been developed much further. I don't care that you only get one option per gender-identity vs preference (there's dating simulators out there and internet porn), but you start feeling the character, you have these sweet and romantic moments with them (if you liked them), a hot but more just pg-13 scene... then a few cute texts from them (nice touch), then... that's it. You wanna visit them more, you wanna do more with them, you want some follow-up missions for what went down for them... but.. no that's pretty much just it. Its done. 
* Oh, and the fashion thing. There are some really cool outfits there (though I think there could be more cool sexy ones) but you kinda end up in the chicken-hat scenario. This outfit -is- more 'you' but you are always in first-person, and the other one has more mod-slots.....  (I just said screw it, every few days drive to all the vendors and buy the outfit I like, and if my armor is down a few points meh. I'll still have a character that looks cool in camera-shots, and I can still headshot fast enough they shouldn't be touching my armor).
* 3rd person - really really should've been an out-of-box option for the sake of immersion (fortunately didn't get motion sick like I do with most 1st person games so yay)
* sometimes sneaking gets glitchy and you find yourself just standing up for no reason, and then half the room stares at you and draws their guns. But not often and quick-save is super approachable, so yay
* cyberdeck vs slow-time. This... this made me unhappy. Why in the world are these two in the same slot? Cyberdeck is required for two entire skill trees, 1/3 of the game, for SO much interesting depth of play. I was super excited about slowing time, had this whole vision of a Neo / Equilibrium gun-kata thing going.... aaaand no. 'Cause if you want that you can't do 33% of your skill-trees and lose out on a ton of interactions. I mean you still kiiinda slow time with aim/dodge and out of stealth... but not really. Its nice enough but situational and much harder to really utilize in shootiness. Cyberdeck should've been its own slot, the slow-time one should've had its own slot for people that like to play like that (a lot of people don't, but a lot of people do), not this either-or trade-off on two potentially core mechanics

.... I think that's about all my gripes. And given the sheer scale of the game? Damn that's not a lot of gripes. I haven't finished it yet (milking it for all I can before doing more main missions) but I already know I'll wish it had been longer. I already wish several of the side-stories had carried on much further. But yea... if your machine can run this, just get it. Screw the negative click-bait youtube videos, forget the drama, just play this. This isn't Fallout 76 deserved drama, this is a genuinely good game that I just wrote way too much about because of how much I liked it"
1610017049,"This is another positive vote that I can give after completing the main story and most of the side quests. 
Definite I can recommend this game, it is pretty damn good! 

Performance was acceptable with about medium settings at ~40fps, 1080p on an ancient X58 platform with Xeon X5680 and GTX 1060-3G. Had no blocker issues and troubles."
1610016755,"Super nice environments, sound and models, but that's about it, can't recommend in its current state, game is a buggy mess and driving is abysmal. Essentially a triple A early access at the moment."
1610016626,"If you can overlook some of the graphical oddities that crop up from time to time, the side quests and main story offer an engaging and visually stunning experience (assuming you aren't on a low end PC).

Gigs and random stuff going on is a bit meh and AI is dumb as hell as is the traffic logic, but otherwise I really enjoyed my playthrough."
1610016367,"I've already reviewed this game but after putting many more hours in I wanna say this:

DO NOT BUY THIS SHALLOW EXCUSE FOR AN OPEN WORLD RPG.

Customization is lack luster, starting off you can never see your character, not in reflections, cutscenes, or even when you're buying clothes.  The only time you can see your character is if you're in your inventory or you're opting into it by looking into the mirror.  And even when you can see yourself, god is it awful.  You can't change the physical appearance of your character after you create it and the clothes they offer you are mondane at best.  There are some pretty cool armors but you'll mostly be focused on how many mod slots a piece of equipment has over its actual stat value so with NO transmog system your character will run around looking like an idiot.

The open world aspects are 2 gens old.  NPCs don't have daily routines as advertised, nor do they have any interesting interactions unless they're already a character in the game.  They just trudge through the streets roaming the block 4 times till they despawn and you see the same exact npc 2 seconds later.  No police chases as advertised, npcs literally don't know how to drive outside their set path, and they have 2 reactions when you pull out a gun, duck or stay there.  The AI is mind numbingly dumb.  Some of the side quests are interesting.  Thats about it.  The little run-ins with gang members are always in the same spots and will always respawn, so no random encounters nor do your ingame choices affect any of it, unlike how it was advertised to do so.

The writing in the game is pretty solid, if it were advertised as a linear fps story.  There are some really good parts but your friendship with Jackie seems very shortlived and rushed in order to fit other story elements in the game.   There is quite literally about 2% of dialogue options in the game that affect anything.  The other 98%, which is a lot because most of this games custscenes are sitting and talking, have no meaningful affect on the story.  Not only that, the only things that change with what background you choose to start from are the first few hours of gameplay, after that it's quite literally the same, even with the specific dialogue options you get for each one, nothing changes.  It's all the same outcome.  The choice of illusion is embarrassing.

The gameplay is buggy and unrewarding.  It feels clunky and half the skillpoints you can use to upgrade your trees go into pointless abilities that literally don't exist or have no rhyme or reason to because they should be things you should be able to do by default, or there not meaningful enough to warrant spending your skill points because why would you worry ab increasing your headshot damage when a weapon already has a modifier on it for it?  Weapons look bland and are really only cool to look at if it's unique rarity, and even then they feel bland in most cases.

Sound design is objectively awful.  Many things are missing from cutscenes and normal gameplay.  Thats all.

Don't buy this game.  It's rushed, poorly designed, and has a lackluster story with false promises of choice and promises that were never fulfilled.  Any review here saying this game is good looking at it in rose tinted glasses.  This game looks beautiful and is miles wide but very, VERY shallow.  CDPR should be ashamed of themselves and everyone who made the devs rush this game out should be fired.  This game needed at least another 2 years to live up to the promises they made.

"
1610016060,I REEEEEEEEAAAALLY hope these devs just keep working on this game and make it what it was supposed to be.
1610015778,"Quickly. De main atrium. See to [b] de kamyonèt[/b], V!

1610015137,"I really hurts me negative reviewing it but here we go...
I played the whole game on steam, got about 100 hours of gameplay, made ever side quest i could including all Fixers jobs. But when i finished it I felt a bad tast, it felt wrong and really not done. The game has no replay value AT ALL. I have made all the endings at the same save game, just chose a companion to the last heist, after the credits, just go back to point of no return and choose another ending. Do that 5 times and you have your self all endings, wich 3 are the same changing just the npcs with you. After that all I felt was that i could just unistall the game, and that I could never play it again and enjoy different paths, It was all set up and you choices never matter, you can see this you self just quick saving before a dialog option and doing it again, nothing matters. Even Fallout 4 for christ sake, you cant just reload you last save game and play all endings, you make choise through out the game at directly impact the ending, bad as it is, it really do. Even sides quests, fallout 4 every charecter in sides quests can be killed and afftect the outcome of it, it does not affect you main story of couse but at least you feel that you choises change somthing in that litte story. Cyberpunk does not have that, ALL side quests, are also scripted and are even less player driven that the main quest
The worst part is, this is the place we get set now.  We can't have what was going to be, because they've committed to THIS.  They will try to sell us on less than what was promised so long as it's more than what we currently have.  All the DLC, free or otherwise, all the patches...it's not gonna transform it from a looter-shooter into some deep RPG like we wanted it to be.  We'll always have level-locked clothes and weapons, when they have no place in this game (because making a hundred versions of the same weapon is easier than making a wide variety of weapons).  We probably won't get combat chems, since they devalue the cybernetics, we get more co-op with companions likely, I'd be impressed if any car customization went further than aesthetics... I just don't see them making the game that was advertised because of the sheer amount of stuff that would have to be entirely overhauled and remade.  The game is out, so we can only have an improved version of what it is, we can't have what we wanted it to be, what was advertised.
Now that the game is lauched they cant remake or change gameplay, story or anything. they cant turn this game into a rpg. They can at most patch and fix and thats all. We will eventually have a game that runs good, no or minimla glitches and all of that. But forever we will have an empty game. They should remove the god damn game from every story, fick change it to beta on steam, say that it is unfinished and it will change through time. That would be way better.. but wont happen

1610015125,"To preface this review, this won't be taking into account the bugs and poor optimization that is plaguing many users.  I encountered my fair share of bugs and issues throughout my playthrough, albeit nothing game-breaking thus far.  I completely understand the desire for a more Polished (haha) game especially after so many delays, and it's a fair reason to not buy the game right now.  I, however, am writing this review based on my personal experience with the game, and boy did I enjoy it.

For starters, this game is not a mind-blowingly, revolutionary game that many people were hyping it up to be after being in development for so many years, but I would be lying if I said this wasn't a DAMN good single player experience.  Some parts of the game may seem pretty run of the mill for futuristic RPGs, but as you begin to delve deeper into the story, the side missions and the supporting characters, you'll be completely immersed in what Night City has to offer.   That doesn't even take into account the absolutely stunning environment CD PROJEKT RED has created.  In combination with an original soundtrack that fits perfectly with the city, there are some absolutely breathtaking moments in this game that just make you slow down and take it all in.

In conclusion, this may not be the once in a lifetime experience that people might have been expecting, but if you go in with realistic expectations this is definitely a game that's worth your time."
1610014881,Looking past the bugs its a really great game!
1610014434,Great game !!! better then any of the other games that came out last year
1610014266,"I'll keep it short. Many others have elucidated on the same points I wish to make. It's a lot of fun, and exceeded my expectations in many ways, mostly the fantastic story and characters. But it takes a step back in regards to AI, driving, stuff to do in the city, and others. I hope they smooth out the bugs, revamp the UI, add some mini-games, and more with the hotfixes, patches, and future DLC. Fingers crossed. Still loving it so far, and recommend it."
1610014007,It's a good game but there are several bugs that they need to fix
1610013974,"I hoped for more after 8 years of development. Makes me wonder what CDPR have been doing under development?

The game is riddled with bugs and there is no point in going into detail since everyone pretty much knows about these bugs. All I can say that these bugs worsens the experience. 
Small features that could the game even better for example a hide helmet option or call a cabdriver/flying vehicles, it's the small things that makes good impact on the gaming experience.

 There is so much that needs fixing and so much to improve. Making dialogue decisions makes almost no impact on the story, feels like it's just there for no reason. Lipsync is off, sound overlaps very often and glitches.

Overall the main story was pretty good. For some reason it felt a bit short, there is much potential to fill out the story. Music was pretty good.

Don't buy this game until they've fixed most of the issues I've mentioned and more. This was not a next gen experience in the slightest. Save your money and wait till price drops.
"
1610013875,"Good game, nice endings. Liked it a lot."
1610013653,bug simulator 2020 is so good! CDPR did a good job!
1610013617,"While I enjoyed this game, it barely scrapes through a recommended. 

You can see what content was cut and what content was hastily implemented, the foundation of a great game which I don't think will become too much better with age due to the fundamental flaws.

Definitely not worth the full price in its current state."
1610013559,"It's buggy at times, but I like it
"
1610013457,"Disappointment and utter waste of potential is what the most over hyped up game of possibly the last decade is. After having spent a near 100 hours into it, this game is arguably, as somebody on Youtube commented, the Fyre Festival of video games. 

I bought into the hype and am currently going through buyer's remorse. If there is anything this game has taught me and that is never ever buy a game at launch. Its quite absurd that a 2020 AAA video game has been outdated by a 16 year old video game like GTA San Andreas and also the recent Yakuza series.   

There is no way CDPR is ever recovering from this mess, they have lost all respect from us gamers and along with a significant portion of the loyal fanbase.  

This game is good at best and an absolute disappointment.  

The following video sums up my opinion about this game, do watch it if you have the time 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CymqHdNYkg&ab_channel=BeatEmUps 



"
1610013405,Absolutely amazing game...Maybe one of the best of all time and i've been playing video games since the early 80's. Think Grand Theft auto V meets Blade Runner/Robocop in terms of the gameplay and style.
1610013158,hurr durr pcmr
1610013084,The game is fun has a style of its own and good tone.  If your pc can handle it its fun. There a bugs and some graphical issues from time to time.  As far as story so far some parts interesting and some bland.  I've been taking my time and not rushing anything so I've done more side content than main story and the side content is bland for the most part go here do this or that with a phone call and message at the start and end I did run across a few that were different but only two so far.  A lot of the character progression feels bloated so many stats and points for things that don't seem to matter so far beside skill checks or equipment.   I'll update this when I complete the main story. So my verdict so far its a fun game with a lot to do and explore even if it doesn't reinvent anything
1610013038,"I loved this game, incredibly fun and immersive, but F every single one of those endings. I was so invested in this story and every single ending was a disappointment."
1610013031,lol
1610012543,Lots of bugs but I can't help but love it
1610012455,"didnt really see bugs but the game definitly sucks, its just boring and it takes way too long to get somewhere and if you drive too fast the lag starts kicking in. none of the controls feel nice, im glad i was never hyped for this game because then i would be super dissapointed rn. 2/10"
1610012270,"This game delivers on so much that I want. I tried not to watch much gameplay footage before I had a chance to experience it myself because I wanted to be surprised by the details that CDPR put into this game. This game scratches that Sci-Fi itch so many of us have and at times it does it like no other game has done before. And when I say that I primarily mean in the realm of animation and acting. As I say this I think of Naughty Dog and Uncharted and Last of Us but that is all done via cutscenes. Here we see animation flourish from the first person perspective in ways only Valve has accomplished with Half- Life. 

But now there is ray tracing! And the detail. The sound. Just everything that brings a scene or location together. Despite the bugs and graphical glitches, this game so often transcends all that bullshit and brings an experience that deserves to be played. 

To wrap up, this game could be that Cyberpunk/RPG experience you have been waiting for. The story is fulfilling and you feel like your choice actually creates the narrative you want to enjoy. You don't feel cheated for picking one choice over the other. It's perfect story development that isn't heavy handed. Gameplay can be lackluster similar to that of The Witcher but just like The Witcher it never dampens the fun you have exploring. I've never been much of a fan of medieval stories and settings similar to The Witcher but I enjoy them none the less. Sci-Fi is my bag and to me this game is what The Witcher 3 was to so many people. It's a game that has so much to uncover. 

That being said, we know the controversy behind this game. It can change so much with patches, but you can experience a full story with interesting side quests here. It is hours of content. Well worth you time if you have the system that can handle it. It can look decent without ray tracing but man does it look amazing turned on and you really need a powerful rig to run this game well. I run it OK on my computer and I am still impressed. 

That is the game I experienced and it is what it is. Rip to the people playing on PS4/Xbox One."
1610012254,"The stupid hype about this game made me buy it. I like gta 5, cyberpunk on the other hand is nothing more than an casual open world game. its really nothing special."
1610012108,"It's not ready.
They tryed to hide the problems the game still had before launch. They took videos down etc. because they were afraid of spoilers? CDPR showed so much of the game before launch you would know half of the game already if you watch all the stuff, no the reason was that people could see that the game is not ready and won't buy it(d!ckmove). They tryed to make it look as cool as possible to sell as much as possible. 
CP2077 is like half cooked meal placed nicely on a plate to fool the guest who already payed for it. The trust in this company is gone for me. 
The game could've been so good and perhaps it will be one day but if you are a lucky person and havn't played it yet, wait half a year or more.
To give you an idea of the problems the game has:
-animations are very raw sometimes or missing completely
-there is almost no interaction with the world 
-want to climb up one of the big houses to get a nice view? nope they are not solid and you can see that you were never supposed to see the top of these buildings.
-boundaries everywhere (parts of the map witch are still in progress) even a whole district in the city is not done yet.
-ok but the main mission is cool right? maybe, not for me since the ending were you would see important stuff was only a screenshake mess for me(like starting a new skyrim playthrough with 200+mods and forget to activate them after the intro) and everything was so unpolished that i was kinda sad, i couldnt belive how a big company is willing to risk all it's reputation for that. 
If someone in a local shop would try to sell me stuff like they did, i would never visit him again."
1610011192,I don't know why this game has so many negative review ! But I really like this game.
1610011176,It's a bit of a mess but it's fucking beautiful.
1610011034,badass on max
1610010993,"Do not believe all the bad thing people say about this game on the Internet.
 [i] Cyberpunk 2077 [/i] is an amazing and the most immersive experience a gaming industry can offer. A truly monumental game.

I got almost all the endings and completed basically all side quests and gigs. Throughout entirety of my playthrough i had only 1 game breaking bug that i fixed by just reloading the save i made exactly on the spot and 1 time my game crashed, luckily i didn't lost any progress that time. There were of course other bugs but they were more funny than ruining the experience, [i] you know like the cock out of V's pants on the character screen :) [/i]

The most important part of the game is the story and it is simply [i] breathtaking [/i] from start to finish. Personally i'm not satisfied with some of the endings but they are really good nevertheless, [spoiler] just a bit too sad for my taste [/spoiler]. And the game worldbuilding is just amazing and immerses you in that harsh cyberpunk world. But the game is really too short though and will greatly benefit from the upcoming big DLCs, [spoiler] especially considering that most of the endings look like cliffhangers! [/spoiler]

People say that it's a bad RPG and yes it is... but it's just as good as The Witcher 3 [u] which is a bad RPG too [/u] yet the latter is considered one of the best RPGs ever made. So please don't jump on the hate bandwagon and just play the game properly first.
Character progression allows for a lot of different playstyles and some really powerful and fun-to-play builds. There is a room to breathe even on harder difficulties! But it is kinda bland with most of the skills just being passive and not changing anything but how powerful your character is. And personally my problem with it is that in the end V is always an all-rounder character.

There are some bad things too though, like the lifepaths which were meant to be a major point according to the game presentations yet in the final game they offer only 3 different ~20 minutes beginnings and some dialogue choices that don't matter much. AI is bugged and poorly done and i definitely missed some features that were announced before but either completely not present in the game now or replaced by some simpler alternatives.
And even though you can play and choose a bit different views of the world for V they always will be the same tough mercenary no matter your playstyle or choices you make or your chosen lifepath. Overall V is a great and developed character so it's not really a con i think but it definitely limits the roleplaying aspect.

Performance wise game actually runs pretty well. I got really modest PC specs that are actually quite outdated already:
-GTX 1050 2gb
-i5 9400f
-16 gigs of ram
-900p monitor
The game is installed on a cheap SATA3 SSD and i can play in almost perfectly smooth 30 fps on medium-to-low settings with a bit of dynamic resolution for a harder in-game moments.
Of course this game won't run on more budget systems. What else did you expect from a [b] truly next generation experience [/b]?

I'd give this game a [b] 8.6/10 score [/b]. The game has it's flaws but so is the every other masterpiece. Flaws are what makes masterpiece a masterpiece. Nothing is simply perfect but this game is great and has no competition from the modern gaming industry."
1610010511,"Yes the game does have bugs yes it was annoying as hell needing to deal with them however when you play through it and get past these bugs its a great world and story I found myself lost in the vastness of night city and the side missions having a actual impact on the overall story how you get to interact with Silverhand the environment around you the amount of options you get for approaching combat and don't get me started on the soundtrack and music in this game the songs from samurai are stuck in my head and probably won't be going anywhere anytime soon it is a great game and quite possibly the best thing to really come out of 2020 for me this is the reason I got into PC gaming and built my own computer I'm am so grateful I did not stick around on console to play this because my experience would have been ruined for me I truly feel bad for everyone on console that can't enjoy this game the way it was intended to be and those who didn't make it to begin with this game will hold a special place in my heart many reasons story,character,music, the factor it got me to change how I play games and experience a whole new side of things, overall this game has changed me weather I like or not and I hope someone else will enjoy it the same way I did or possibly even more"
1610010407,Excellent game. Bug rumors are exaggerated. Well worth the time!
1610010399,"The story is engaging, with a couple possible endings whose quality puts a lot of games out there to shame."
1610010381,"After 150 hours and 3 playthroughs with each life path. I can safely say that this is one of the best games I have ever played, I have no regrets playing this day. Also got to hangout with keanu reeves so thats a bonus."
1610010301,A suprise to be sure but a welcome one.
1610010062,"Although the game has probably come out too soon with a fair amount of bugs, it doesn't take away from the gameplay. The story line is very involved which is great for an open-world game, as they can come across as quite repetitive. I do recommend... give it a go"
1610010012,Might play this again in 2077.
1610009998,"Great plot, characters, skill development and immersive world."
1610011862,"While the game is somewhat fun, it is too full of disappointments for me to give it a thumbs up.  I don't write short reviews.  So if you're a child of the digital age with the attention span of a gnat, this is TLDR for you.  Bear in mind also, that this review comes from someone who played the Cyberpunk tabletop.

1)  Cyberware, my god what a disappointment.  No full borg option (plenty of full-borg NPC's though!), and many of the options are not NEARLY as impactful as they should be due to a flawed combat system.  My last character in the tabletop could quite literally face-tank railgun rounds.  When he stomped into the average gang hideout, he was basically the Terminator.  In this game even with Legendary cyberware, I die way too easy.  Like stupidly easy for someone with titanium bones, and ""legendary"" dermal plating.  All in all, the Cyberware in this game is a joke.  If by some chance someone associated with developing this game reads this (and I know companies have people who do that)  the cyberware is bad, and you should feel bad.  The Cyberware of the setting was one of its defining elements, and I don't think you could have given a bigger disappointment here without omitting it all together.  

2)  Weapons, armor, grades.  I truly hate when single-player games incorporate an MMO-like rarity system.  This suggests a developer who does not understand the point of these systems.  They come from MMO's which people play largely due to the social aspect, and thus need something with infinite replay value.  This type of system has no place in a single-player game and speaks to many problems or laziness in regards to game and weapon design.  Why create a variety of weapons when you can fool people into thinking they're getting something new by making them acquire the same damn thing over and over again?

Additionally, the weapons or lack thereof in this game is heartbreaking.  The tabletop had a huge variety of weapons, and pretty much none of the weapons I was hoping to see made it into the game.  The last character I played which I spoke of above?  He walked around with a 14.5mm ""assault rifle"".  For people who aren't into guns and don't get the scaling, that's a Soviet HMG round more powerful than a .50 BMG.  For backup he carried a .666 caliber revolver.  (And didn't have to be full-borg to do it, close, but not quite there.)  Instead of some of those awesome options, we get this bullshit with MMO-like rarity on what is actually a pretty small collection of weapons.  

Also, no iconic LMG exists, and HMG's are temporary-only? (Plenty of NPC's have HMG's though.)  What the hell CDPR?  Did no one on your staff ever play the tabletop?  Do none of your devs familiarize themselves with the source material before trying to make a game of it?  Or did management fornicate the canine on this one?  I know it may not be a realistic expectation for a video game to match all of the options of a tabletop, but it feels like you didn't even try.

Enemy AI is bad, civilian AI is bad, and the police?  Oh whoever implemented the bullshit ""police spawn on top of you"" system should be beaten with a box of keyboards.  Also, it takes entire squads of highly-trained cops to bring down cyberpsychos, but no matter your level, cyberware, or armor, bullshit Maxtac cops will show-up and one-shot you, even at max level.  Whoever is responsible for this needs to beaten with an office desk.  Don't ask me how to do that, some creativity may be required.

3)  Broken promises.  I've been lied to enough times by companies like Bethesda and Blizzard that I don't take developer promises seriously.  But man, you people couldn't have missed the mark any harder except by running the other direction.  

4)  Little things.  Whoever calls this an RPG, doesn't really understand the concept of an RPG.  Example.  Just before writing this review, I took out a gang that was killing homeless people.  When I was done there was a survivor, a woman on the ground, obviously wounded, looking up at me in pain.  No option to help her in any way.  No option to give her one of the 150 heal-inhalers I had.  No option to call an ambulance.  Nothing.
The complete lack of the little details that matter in creating a real feeling in a world is appalling.

Also, character customization is a joke.  IRL I'm built much closer to Jackie.  I would have liked on my first play-through to have a character who looks a little more like me.  But I can't even adjust things like the breadth of the shoulders, or, any number of other details.  Every V I make is the same scrawny dude no matter the face and hair he wears.  Just another disappointment. 

I  bought the game knowing there were a lot of complaints so that's on me.  But the hype for this game had risen unrealistically high.  Often hype rises to the point that no game can realistically meet it.  But even with my skepticism I never foresaw what a let-down this would be.  All I can think of now when I try to play the game, is not even ""what could have been"", but rather, what should have been. 

I paid for the game so I'll keep playing until I feel I've gotten my entertainment dollars out of it.  But this game is an embarrassment  to the Cyberpunk name.  I also have a nagging suspicion that some of the features I've noticed conspicuously absent will be paywalled behind DLC."

"
1610009591,"As much as I like the general story of the game (since this is actually an RPG), the game has way too many bugs and broken game mechanics for me to be able to justify the price of this game in general. 

I've dug 70+ hours into this game, poking around at the game's mechanics + the world's integrity and in terms of just sheer playability on PC, I'll give it a 6 / 10 in terms of the number of weird random bugs you see (specifically related to car crashes) where things just end up in the wrong place.

Here are some examples
1. Car crashes can cause cars to fly into buildings
2. weird cases when you suddenly get hit by a car and you end up inside the floor and can't move

In terms of game mechanics there are some that are just downright weird such as
1. Stash system is wonky -- your main stash in your apartment is not linked to your stash in your cars
2. Certain items cannot be stored in the stash
3. The UPGRADING system is badly designed -- upgrading your favourite early game items to be usable until the end of the game is exponentially to expensive.. so much so that if you REALLY like a certain legendary item, you might want to wait picking it up later on in the game just so you get it when the item has scaled to your level... which is stupid because that's the whole point of getting legendary items - to use it when you need it.. not when you dont need it anymore
4. money bugs, duplication glitches
5. The promise of ""intelligent"" crowd is false -- crowds are mindless, duplicated models, disappear from behind you all of a sudden at random
6. police system is really bad... i drive down 1 block and the the wanted rating drops? weird... not to mention these guys probably practice Ninjutsu because they just pop out of nowhere beside you when you do anything ""illegal"". 

While the PC version is much much more stable than the console versions, I simply cannot recommend it to other people for the price if the point of comparison are games like the Witcher 3 or RDR which are much much older.

I'd stay away from this game for the price point that it's advertised. If you really want to know the story (if you're an RPG fan type of person) - go watch people doing walkthroughs on YOUTUBE instead and only play the game mid 2021 when they've fixed all of these weird mechanics and bugs.

I wish the developers all the best in fixing the game and juggling business pressure / objectives that got them to this situation in the first place. I'm pretty sure no one wanted this game to be shipped out in this level of a mess for the level of publicity it was advertised and hyped for."
1610008178,Hopefully I can run it at 60fps in 2077.

1610007788,great game. very much excited for the upcoming DLCs
1610007584,"This review will be in opposition to people saying there isn't enough content.

The deep RPG elements are all there, and there for you to actually use on ALL of the content in the game, not just main story missions. If you just play the main quests and ignore everything else, those 30-40 hours are ALREADY enough for the price. But if you ignore everything else you are not being fair to how much content the game actually has. There are dozens and dozens of great side quests with unique situations, dialogue, and shards.

There's one where you can first talk to a ripperdoc who boasts about his connections and making it in his profession, then when you do the side quest that has you come from his building's basement he gets scared that you saw his illegal harvesting operation and acts like he was forced to work there. You can choose to not believe him and he runs away, or believe him and he stays as a vendor. Another quest has you convince an officer from pursuing a case to let her know her corrupt cop colleagues are sending a hit out on her if she cracks the case; if you convince her, eventually you can come back to the quest location and a dead police officer is found with a shard showing a conversation revealing that she killed the corrupt cops who sent the hit and were involved with the gang trafficking. And seriously, almost every side quest I've played has something to this kind of effect, and there are looking like 50+ of them on the map. The deepness of the side quests is not a joke and if you ignore it and then complain about lack of content you are just being unfair to the game developers and other people looking for reviews of the game.

The body upgrade and mod systems are also very deep. Attributes and perks are awesome, but when you add in mods and upgrades the options you have become surprisingly large considering what kind of game this is. The weapons and abilities have plenty to choose from and are generally quite tight and functional to control. It isn't any worse than what I'd expect from a game based around gunplay, like Borderlands. The fact that the game is both a deep RPG, with a weapon system this good, with this many well written quests, and that looks this good, is kind of insane.

Yes there is a enough content. And it's good content."
1610006960,Cyberlies 2077 nothing to rescue from this open broken world
1610006459,"don't listen to reviews, if you like the lore and have been as interested in this IP as me, just try it out :)"
1610006288,"Extremely fun, I have put hundreds of hours into witcher 3 on console and heard awful things about cyberpunk on the ps4 so decided to snatch it on pc. Its such a wonderful and fun futuristic world with amazing graphics and so far a lovely story (I am currently at 61 hours in and just started the act 2s story quests)"
1610006272,so bomb
1610006466,"I truely can't say more than I am totally addicted to the game!! Great Game so far, but the only part, which is still one of many topics since launch, are the bugs and they [b] really [/b] need to be fixed. There is so much work that needs to be done for polishing the game, like animations, textures loading-times (doesn't even load on every graphic setting and I am using a SSD so it's not because of a HDD either), FPS drops like in some areas of the game where it rushes down from total 60 fps capped to 15 fps (Ultra Settings, 4K, but in Ultra Performance to hit 60 fps), sound crackling (experienced only in this game so far), glitching under map sometimes and bugs that stop you from continuing the missions (mostly Story Missions).

So, I know this should be a more positive review to expect since I ""recommend"" this game, but only under some conditions, either you buy this game now, but you have to handle many bugs that can occur while playing or you wait a couple of weeks or months until most of them are finally fixed and you buy it then.

And by the way, [b][u] do not [/u][/b] buy the game on [b] [u] last-gen consoles (PS4 and Xbox One S/X) [/u][/b] if you consider to buy it on a console than PC, because of heavy performance issues at the moment!"

1610004524,"Ok so for the good.... the visuals a great (speaking in an artsy kind of sense) ! The story is engaging! Definitely a pleasure to look at on a quality monitor with a decent PC pushing the graphics. Gameplay is unique, and for the most part, well thought out.

The bad..... the physics and mechanics are absolute TRASH!!! this is NOT next gen gaming. This is some college kids summer project. Theres so many flaws to point out (which i wont, theres enough youtube videos out there showin how almost all hte GTA games blow these mechanics and physics out of the water)

In my opinion, this was 7+ years of wasted funds, time, effort, and hype..... i had high hopes for this game..... and left with a pretty gut wrenching sense of disappointment!"
1610004488,This is a beta at best. There are way too many bugs. There are so many that I won't even attempt listing them. This version of the game should have never been released. Very big disappointment. If there is a Cyberpunk 2 I doubt I will purchase. I appreciate what the developers and artists have done. It's clear this was management pushing the game out before it was complete in order to cash in on the hype. Shameful.

1610003488,"Its a pretty good story driven game but def needs a lot of work with the NPC's. The story for all characters you meet drags you in buy your feet. The way each character is written is well put together in some aspects, But when we complete their quest line you can do or interact with them in almost any way besides talking to them or calling them just to have them say the same thing over and over again. The NPC's are iffy at best but i believe that its being worked on right now as I post this. the gun play is mediocre and the melee weapons feel a bit strong when it gets to late game. There are some good and bad glitches that happen every once in a while, Example being sliding down a part of the map and dying instantly due to the fact that you were moving to quickly. If you like a story driven game this is the perfect thing for you. It's not truly a RPG but by the time they patch and add things to it I'm hoping that it will be. Like there are some choices that I would love to see as a possibility in the future. The biggest thing that needs done is the AI for other characters. They dont feel like they are part of the game until you interact with them. Example: this girl was comforting someone while they were crying on the street and when I tried to talk to them she said its hot.... while it was raining. Overall its a decent game, needs a lot of fixing on the smaller details, but other than that I'd say its a pretty decent game."
1610003450,Buying this game and forcing myself to enjoy it was the same experience as when Watch Dogs released.
1610003431,"Lazy game design, boring story, and countless game breaking bugs. Biggest disappointment of 2020."
1610003397,"Not worth playing in it's current state. Many gameplay features shown in the trailers were entirely scrapped for the final release. Outside of the main storyline, which has the highest degree of polish, there really isn't anything worth doing. It is quite evident how hastily and sloppily this game was thrown together. It is not a next gen experience, and it is not the Cyberpunk 2077 that was promised. It is a lifeless husk. I'd say the game could use a solid 1.5 - 2 more years of actual development."
1610003396,"Dunno what people are saying about Cyberpunk 2077.

1610003148,Love it
1610003141,"After playing the game for a decent amount of time and got 2 endings (second one, i just loaded it from the point of no return and played again), here are the pros and cons that I can think of. 

Pros:
1. Gameplay is fun. (Although that depends on what you're looking for)
2. Soundtracks are great. 
3. The environment is great. 
4. Story is decent.

Cons:
1. Loads of bugs and optimizations issues (What a surprise, right? Although I'm sure they'll fix this eventually)
2. Controls don't seem too smooth sometimes. (Although this could just be me).
3. Story felt a bit short to me. (I could've finished it in like 20-30 hours, but I played as many quests and stuff I can to experience everything completely)

Having said all this, I'd say this game is good, or at least decent. Is it the best game ever made or GOTY? Hell no. But does that mean it's bad as people make it out to be? Definitely not. It's your average game. A decent story, fun gameplay stuff etc. Nothing out of the ordinary. I'd recommend it if you are thinking of buying this. But I'd suggest waiting for a sale. If not for a sale, at least, let them fix the pesky issues. And you're good to go."

1610002355,"Supposedly this game has been in development for 8 years?
My initial impression was the launch day experiences were positive and glitch free but within a week or so of play time I started finding serious code problems that prevented me from finishing the game. I wasn't able to get past Act 2.
I enjoyed it for what it was worth but I expected better for a game that's been worked on for that long to make it to release stage. I will keep an eye out for it and see if they continue to work on fixing it, adding new stuff but even with the patch stages at 1.06 I still can't say it's stable enough to recommend."

1609999830,"Bi Witcher zevki alamadım ama hikayesi ve yan görevleri çok başarılıydı. Teknik sıkıntılar giderildikten sonra harika bir oyun olur
Not: RPG kısmı vadettikleri kadar iyi değil"
1609999533,"Overall Rating: 8/10
I base this upon the items below.  It's all subjective; some things I place higher emphasis on personally, but use this as you will.  I give reasons why I poo on some items, and why I love others.

9/10 -*PLOT/QUESTS* 
This game has a solid plot.  The main plot is fractal enough that you can really pursue options and directions that you are interested in, and rarely shoehorn yourself into ""unfun"" scenarios.   My main beef is that if one wanted to, they could goon through the main plot in about 10 hours by my estimate.  When you finish the main plot, you appear immediately where it started, and the game allows you to play the ending an infinite number of times.  Which is cool, but also kind of sucks.  I honestly would have preferred a small dialogue or cinematic explaining why ""V/Johnny came back to the city,"" though admittedly with some endings this would be tough to establish.  The shortness of the main plot and sort-of, late-found non-finality of your choices in the ultimate sense do bring this rating down for me.  The side quests are what make this game really shine, and they also can have crazy, interesting effects on the main story.  I see a lot of hate about Johnny Silverhand's character on the internet; don't buy it, it's a helluva dialogue, and can really be an awesome story if you play it out.

4/10 - *LEVELING*
The leveling system is too polarizing.  Without mods or cheats it is incredibly unlikely (without playing the game for a ridiculously long time) to become ""good"" at more than three skills, and maybe 5-6 subskills.  You are forced to diversify your skills into a base of around 4-5, maybe even 6-7 as I did to do any of the bonus dialogue or operational options.  Unlike other games that use a similar system (Fallout, SPECIAL), the perks under each skill don't feel very meaningful until you get to a much higher level (ex. the ability to craft legendary items @ Crafting 18).  TLDR on leveling; you can't min-max and that blows.

1/10 - *CRAFTING*
It just sucks, but you almost have to have it.  The weapons you can craft are immensely more powerful than the ""found"" variants, and gun shops are stupid expensive unless you (see above) waste perks for bartering.  You have to individually click to craft components that you need hundreds of when up-crafting into better components.  There is an easy way around this, but it is 100% an exploit and you can just google it. 

8/10 - *COMBAT* 
The combat is okay, definitely a step up from your traditional open world.  Quickhacking is useful, more so on higher difficulties.  Enemies are DUMB, even on higher difficulties, they just get thicc.  The qualms aside, it feels and looks great, blade finishers are aight, and criticals and headshots do a reasonable amount of damage (thicc enemies aside).  Grenades are a joke unless you (see above) burn valuable perks on them.  Mantis blades are dope as hell, same for gorrila hands.  The aesthetic and overall feel save this category for me.

2/10 - *VEHICLES*
Again, minor disclaimer, I'm not someone who really plays driving games beyond stuff like GTA.  That said, every car except for the ""Thornton"" trucks felt incredibly terrible to drive, especially the motorcycles.  An early side quest landed me a truck, and I kept it as my main driver the rest of the game, as all the vehicles handled like trash, and it was ""premium"" trash.  The fast travel points almost invalidate the need to drive most of the time anyways.  It's honestly sad, because you get an absolute TON of side missions to go purchase EXORBITANTLY priced vehicles with your funds, and they look cool, but it's just wasted because you ain't cutting any corners with that 75000 credit car, and you know after driving for like 10 minutes.  All the cars look cool though.  Slight redemption.

10/10 - *GRAPHICS*
*Disclaimer* I have a high-end rig.  If you can't meet minimum spec, this game is not for you.  They are serious about the requirements.

This is the new Crysis of our age.  The game looks fantastic; I run it maxed @1440p, and average just over 60fps, with a noted min of around 42 when I load for about a second after fast travel.  The particles and ray tracing are so in sync with the actions you take it's simply mesmerizing.  The surreal art and luminous nature of the environment gave me goosebumps when I first saw it.  I would recommend turning off Film Grain and Depth of Field; this actually gave me a crisper view of Night City.  This is easily the most beautiful game I have ever played.

8/10 - *IMMERSION/BUGS*
I personally have only experienced minor bugs that one would expect from a newly released game.  I run well above recommended spec, so take that with a grain of salt.  The main bug I see is occasionally an item I picked up remains described in the bottom right of the screen if I enter a dialogue before it finishes.  It then sticks until I pick something else up.  Additionally, I have seen some T-posing, models stuck in objects, and had some awkward dialogue silences.  Nothing game breaking though.  The gameflow is typically quite smooth, and immersive.

"
1609999488,"Buy it when it's cheaper and when the bugs have been fixed, a good game with a great story but definitely not a must play."
1609999399,Exceeds expectations (except for a few bugs)
1609999231,"For those expecting a completed game at launch, I am sorry to disappoint.  

The core game is great, with deep characters and excellent storytelling.
Night City is an unbelievable metropolis with incredible scale and diverse regions.

At this point in the game's life-cycle (1 month since release), the game is still lacking in content to keep someone engaged in the world of Cyberpunk and replayability suffers in that regard.  Many NPCs offer one line responses when you talk to them and the wanted system is VERY broken.  This isn't even addressing all the numerous bugs, some of which will effectively require you to reload a previous save to continue.

I know my criticisms may seem harsh with regards to this game, but I will still recommend this game despite its numerous flaws.  The modding community is beginning to put out numerous quality-of-life mods, and patches are being made regularly.  I have faith that CD PROJEKT RED, will continue to fix bugs with future patches and will add more content (hopefully to rival the likes of GTA), in the near future with free DLC.

I recommend this game for those who want a story rich, futuristic RPG and PC is by far the best way to experience this title.  I would caution anyone with lower-end hardware though as you may not get the best experience.  I can thankfully run this game on my RTX 2080 machine with mixed settings, ray traced reflections enabled and on the balanced DLSS setting at a resolution of 3440x1440 (1440p 21:9 aspect ratio) at roughly 60fps.

This game will get better and hopefully in mid 2021 onward, I will be able to give this game a definite recommendation without caveats.  If bugs bother you, don't buy it.  Once patches are released, in due time, that fix the game fully, your experience will be considerably better."
1609999210,"Game runs smooth and pretty. I haven't run into any (major) bugs after 30 hrs. Story is great. Voice acting is great. Side content seems limitless. 

Overworld gameplay is too similar to GTA in my opinion. I think it's the arcade car mechanics in combo with the map icons directing you to quests.
"
1609998959,"Absolutely amazing game. I have a 1080 and although I play on medium, sometimes low, this game is just so damn fun. Good gunplay, good exploration, nice environments and character, and pretty good customization and RPG elements. The vehicle control and physics are a bit off but you’ll get used to them. I personally stopped seeing major glitches after the first patch but you’ll come across a minor one every now and then, which is to be expected of an open-world game (ie Bethesda). You will not regret buying this game. I haven’t had this much fun since Halo MCC initial release and titanfall 2 coming to steam."
1609998841,"Good game once you look past the bugs, and they will likely be fixed anyways"
1609998748,"not as buggy as many say, very fun game tbh"

Sometimes the enemies catch these Gorilla fists, sometimes the enemies get their heads chopped off, and sometimes I gotta go in with a little pew pew pew. I've been having a lot of fun for High settings at 30 fps. Boy do I wish I could play with High settings at a consistent 60 fps, but I can handle 30 thanks to the pros.

Cons:
-the dildo bat isn't purchasable from the dildo shop (speaking of dildos, there should be a dildo launcher)
-no vehicle customization (at least not yet)
-driving is a little wonky to me, but maybe it's just because I suck at driving on keyboard (I find it easier to drive in 3rd person)
-I can't pet my adopted cat (correct me if I'm wrong)
-cops spawn on you when you commit a crime, an accidental crime of course
-some Junk items are uncollectable (the icon is there, but no option to pick it up is visible; no matter how many times I press the action button, I can't pick them up)
-you can only play in 1st person
-no sliders for character creation (I wanted to give myself a huge badonkadonk, but future mods should be able to give me that)"
1609998284,fun game
1609998282,"If you enjoy RPGs (especially The Witcher 3), this game is right up your alley. If you have the rig to run it and are on the fence about it, buy it. Currently, it's been very popular to hate on the game and there is a lot of misinformation being spread about the game (especially on Reddit and YouTube). This is not a futuristic GTA, it is and always has been a heavy story driven game. There are, valid criticisms of the game like the AI, being to OP at the end game, and driving. However, at the end of the day this game is very good. It has an excellent story, characters, and quests which is something that CDPR always nails and had me emotionally engaged all the time. Gunplay was fun in my opinion as was the quickhacking/netrunning. People who complain about the quickhacking being bad clearly did not invest properly into it. The game lets you build the character the way you wanna play. This is a very brief review, but this is easily one of my favorite games of all time and perfectly captures the Cyberpunk universe."
1609998199,Its a great game besides the glitches. Imagine how great it will be when all things are sorted out??? Great characters and an amazing detailed open world.
1609997963,"Bugs are minimal for PC, if you plan on playing as a dude and want a good ending to the game, here's a hint, Nomad."
1609997929,Great Game. Great Story. Didn't have any issues. overall 10/10
1609997736,Super fun game! Can't wait for the DLC!
1609997556,on pc its great so far
1609997525,"I had high expectations for this game, and it didnt meet most of them. But it did meet a few being a fun immersive game, i found myself running through the city being pulled left and right from event to event, in a good way it was never the same mission in a different area each side job had a story and that was amazing!
"
1609997419,"I haven't finished it yet, but I've spent 35 hours and enjoyed about 34 of them. I think that's a pretty good ratio so far. In fact, I haven't been engaged by a non-VR game like this since Mass Effect 3 (the last tiem I bought a full-priced game too btw), which it strongly reminds me of sometimes. Mix that with GTA V and a healthy dose of Fallout 4, polish everything so that it looks modern and pretty and you've got this game. 

On the topic of polish, it is still a bit buggy, but so far I see slightly funny bug every couple of hours, nothing that stops me progressing or really breaks immersion. In fact the main things that bother me are annoying little things that should be there but aren't: no 3rd person mode, no clothing previews before you buy them, an ugly selection of hairstyles and no body customisation. Well, I say none, you can decide if your female character has a dick and how big it is, which is kind of a first, but it fits the setting and makes some players feel happier with their character so whatever. The characters look really good for the most part, except for your main character. Fiddling with the sliders will get you someone who looks... OK despite the bad hair, then you run across Judy and think 'see? this game engine supports beautiful people. Why can't I make one for my main character?'. Honestly for a game where an aesthetic is so central, you'd think that a large chunk of time would go into making your character look as blade-runner badass and/or hot as possible. Still, a plain character doesn't matter so much if you can't go into 3rd person and hardly ever see her reflection.

The point is, this is a really good game. I am having a great time as-is, and I can forget its faults most of the time. Most of the faults are things that could be patched and I expect they will, either by CDPR or when a decent modding engine gets released. Modders are already hard at work on that, and since the game already contains full nudity, I expect the modders will have no excuse not to jump right into useful gameplay mods without getting distracted."
1609997258,I've been waiting for this game for 7 years now. My hyped died down before there was an official release date but I still looked forward to it. I made sure not to hop back on the hype train when the game was starting to blow up. To get to the point I think it is a slightly above average game with good content even for side missions BUT I'd wait for it to get polished up first because the bugs for me were game breaking so I had to wait for them to fix things just for me to TRY to work around it the bugs that weren't game breaking. In the end I still had fun though.
1609997239,"Omg yes, I reccomend this game."
1609997679,"After spending lots of time on this game, I can finally say that I like it despite the facts that it's a bit buggy. I love the story of this game and the set dressing of this world. Really feel like it's the future. I'm a bit disappointed that some models and texture of the game is a bit rough. My favourite feature is that you can listen to the radio whilst driving a car/bike. The soundtrack of this game is amazing. Have a lot to do in the game. Even though I'm 44 hours in, I'm still at the beginning of Act 2. I love doing side quests and crime stuff. You really get to understand and immerse yourself in the story. One thing I'd love to add, please make all the NPCs romanceable as you said! I don't like any choice that the game has given. Lastly, nothing can top The Witcher 3. I thought this game would, but sadly no."
1609997143,ну чо тут сказать контента ноль но сюжет идеален 12\10 поиграть стоит
1609997143,Good shit
1609997102,"Fun game, pretty riddled with bugs though. Story is beautiful but short, and the game leaves you wanting more after the ending(s).

8/10 would be lesbian again"
1609996935,"i love this game stop the hate :')
"
1609996825,"The story was alright, there was a lot of tech mumbo jumbo making some of the story difficult to follow. When playing the game I started on release so there were many bugs. I have a high end desktop so none of the bugs encountered where game breaking but there were still clear issues with the game that aren't even bugs. Including all cars having no traction so it feels like driving on ice, the police spawning on top of you the second you do a crime- in a game about doing crime, half of the side quest were filler going from one spot to the next killing groups of mindless enemies half of them siting together making one grenade kill them all. On release this game feels like it's still in beta. If CD Project Red had just put the release for 2021 without a date I feel the crunch wouldn't of crippled this game as much as it has. I'd recommend picking this game up months after release so the bugs can be fixed and even then, look for a discount because it's no GTA."
1609997067,"A very immersive world coupled with great story writing makes this game very enjoyable to play, the combat is similar to fallout 4 along side skill trees and play style preferences which can make for interesting theory-crafting and adds to keeping the game fresh. 

While there are a few bugs and performance issues that players will encounter, there isn't anything game breaking or straight frustrating, some can be immersion breaking at most otherwise they can be quite humorous. Like any game these bugs will slowly get patched out with time.

Overall a great game with interesting combat, an incredibly immersive world, and a compelling story."
1609996716,"So, like everyone else This game looked absolutely insane but it is nothing like we expected. I have put 51 hours in the game and I don't completely regret it. I love the story but compared to other open world games, Cyberpunk feels like a game from 2010. AI is trash, cops are worse then cops in a game from 2004, and You need a beefy computer just for 60 fps. The game should of been delayed for another 3 years, I now have trust issues with new games coming out and that trust started to decline when anthem was a disaster.

I know that was all over the place but in general, I don't recommend this game if you don't have a beefy computer, even if you do, the story is really good but the game still feels unfinished so still might be hard to recommend."
1609996471,"DEFINITELY recommend for higher end PCs. I was so disappointed in CDPR at first. They have been so deceitful about the state of the game it actually left me questioning their future as a company at one point.. But i think they learned a lesson and will get the game 100% fixed up for us. ANYWAY, the game runs good on higher end pc's, and the story is pretty exciting. So i do recommend getting it, if you have the hardware."
1609996415,"The launch version of the game obviously had its problems, but it's much better now and I'm getting an extremely decent experience with constant 60FPS on a 1070ti and i5 8th gen processor, medium to high graphics (on launch, I was getting about 45FPS on the same settings and had to downgrade). 

Story-wise, the game totally warrants a second playthrough, since many elements of the main story are much clearer when you replay the game, and it gives you the chance to experiment with side-quests you might wanna do differently this time. 

Gameplay-wise, whoever said that the combat was boring lacks creativity IMO. The game is extremely flexible as to how you wanna play it and your build can be suited to a variety of purposes, so you can be a hack-bot that kills everything by staring intensely at it, a Splinter Cell agent that grabs enemies like you're the next president of the United States and their heads smell really nice, a crazy junkie samurai that slices everything in sight like you're playing Fruit Ninja and the enemies are suspiciously fruit-looking, or just go full John Wick with shotguns, explosives and slow-mo shots. 

All in all, this game doesn't deserve the hate it's gotten, but it also didn't deserve the huge hype that it had. People over-estimated what they were gonna get and who was making it. 9/10 would buy again with my dad's credit card."
1609996239,"Yes it's buggy but man, I want more"
1609996200,"Look lets be real here and not blow smoke. They set some high marks for this title and did they live up to all of it? Short answer, No. That being said its a fantastic world with tons to explore and a beautiful setting especial if you're a fan. The game has plenty to do plenty of lore. Many easter eggs and references hidden in shards and encounters, most of which will not be spoon fed to you you have to go enjoy the world and its by no means a bad game. People like to forget almost every game launches with many bugs many of which are considered smash hit games today. So I say give it a shot you might have a good time. 200 plus hours and still finding new things."
1609996175,Simply Amazing!
1609996111,you can have sex with a  gay hooker
1609996089,can't recommend this game that i can't stop playing
1609996026,"bugs. a lot of it. but whatever. still fun. 7/10 is fair. 

i'd hate to be experiencing this game on a console tho. but imagine being a console pleb... that's a mistake in itself lol"
1609995907,"main story, and all side quests are all really well made and interesting, if you only focus on the stories like I did you wont be disappointed. Not to many bugs, a few here and there nothing game breaking. Overall i would say 4/5 really good buy and worth money but felt as though story was a bit short."
1609995828,I love it besides bugs!
1609995810,"It's not perfect, or even that great, but it's fun, and it's better than waiting for them to finish. LOL"
1609995701,OK™
1609995570,really fun game. totes recommend
1609995565,I know there is a lot of hate on this game but I have really enjoyed it. It has some issues but over all a lot of fun. Really well done!
1609995485,IM COMING
1609995429,"Best FPS RPG i been playing so far
i like to walking around do what ever mission i want first. 

i'm kinna excite for what they gonna add in the future"
1609995414,"Cyberpunk takes some getting into to fully enjoy what it has to offer. At first I was little disappointed in the quality of quests. The map is completely filled with generic, repeatable gigs that usually only offer money and experience. These tedious aspects are made up for completely through the main quest line, ""main"" side quests, and the characters and experiences that they offer. Driving through the city at night with the radio playing is when I realized how much I enjoy the game and the immersive world that CRPR have created. Sometimes when a song I like comes on I just drive around the city enjoying the world until it is done. The only major bugs that I have experienced have, in my opinion, heightened my experience because of the absurdness of them. These are things like characters randomly ragdolling across the street or cars flying through the air. I once had a fixer I was talking to on the phone appear floating in front of my car causing me to crash. I am reminded of Fallout NV in this way and I find them funny. My game has only crashed a handful of times and I feel like these technical problems will only be improved on. Overall Cyberpunk is an incredibly immersive world and experience that takes some getting into but is totally worth it."
1609995315,Disappointment.
1609995150,"Loving this game.  Incredible amount of detail and after 30hrs it seems like I have barely scratched the surface of what the game has to offer. Also, on my PC I haven't experienced any crashes or serious bugs yet."
1609995148,This is very good ~~!!
1609995129,pretty solid game with a some little bugs. 8.5/10
1609995061,Fun game.  Enjoying the heck out of it.
1609995403,"Most of the public outrage I've seen has come from last gen console players and some low end PC users. I have a 3080 TI, I9, and 32 GB of RAM. I run the game on ultra top to bottom and I have only experienced 3 VISUAL bugs. Not gameplay bugs. I have been playing since launch day. Sometimes V t-poses on motorcycles, vehicles are sometimes slow to render, and I was stuck in the ground once but I was able to literally just out of the ground on nearby high ground. The story is great, its beautiful, dozens of builds for replay ability, different gender V can have different relationships, tons of side missions, first DLC is free likely because investors said no more pushing launch date back and CDPR is doing good by the players.

Lets not forget the bugs with Witcher 3 launch which later went on to objectively be the RPG of all time. CDPR will do right by the players. People like to bitch and are begging for refunds because they expect their 8 year old console or 970/I5 to play a next gen game. They had a bug fix patch in 24 hours of release, offering refunds, first DLC free, delivered in every almost every, and promise comeback equal to that of No Man's Sky and this game isn't even a bust. It's fantastic."
1609994978,"I've played quite a bit of this game and what can I say about it? Was it overhyped? Rushed? Was what was promised delivered?

For most people, I think we were a little underwhelmed by the release,  of course, some of that is due to overhype, which always leads to some disappointment. I think the game has some very strong points and others that are clearly underdeveloped.

Strong Points:
[*]Graphics are awesome besides the glitches
[*]The city is pretty huge and interesting
[*]Main quests and story is pretty phenomenal
[*]Characters are unique and interesting
[*]Interesting Perk/Skill System

Weak Points:
[*]The ""open world"" is not developed and other than looks, is quite empty
[*]The large map is mostly devoid of quests, tasks, or interesting tidbits other than loot and some notes
[*]Gangs do not matter and there are no factions or consequences, street cred does not impact your reputation
[*]Large amount of downtime, not a lot of side quests related to main story items, just main story and rando quests

Am I happy with my purchase? So far, yes, but I cannot ignore the fact that there is obviously a void where the open world is lacking detail, attractions, mechanics, and is mostly empty city streets with locked doors and few gang haunts and happenings. The Braindance mechanic seems to be interesting, but other than a few story elements it is unoperational and not available to the player (no, not just the sexual BD's, even just small snippets would be cool). I like the little shard notes sitting about, as well as the radio broadcasts, TV shows, ads, and little world building elements the devs did manage to add in. 

I think the biggest letdown is how a lot of the interesting aspects of night city are mentioned but inaccessible to the player. Even a small amount of braindances, TV shows, Radio Shows, Bars & ETC would make the game more interesting and fill spare time. Kind of a letdown that the pachinko parlors do not allow gambling. Hell, even pokemon on the GBA had virtual slot machines, its not that difficult. 

Cyberpunk is a futuristic storytelling game with neat combat, a cool city to walkthrough and marvel, but lacks non-story content and is missing some major embellishments that make game worlds feel alive. 

I am pausing my playthrough and eargerly awaiting DLC and further content additions. I would be willing to pay for DLC or expansions. At the moment, the developers provided a gorgeous game with a neat story, but not much outside of it.
"
1609994959,"nice
"
1609994846,"if your system can handle it the game is amazing, but if not it wont be worth it.
that being said i run it on my 5 year old gaming desktop on mostly maximum graphics and it runs perfectly (minus the few bugs in game code)"
1609994770,"I was looking forward to this game and I can now give my full review after playing it through completion.

Ultimately I am disappointed!

While this game does have great graphics, the environment and the npcs are lacking immersion, the ai is brain dead and lacks any decent ability to either drive or shoot, many of the promised features were removed from this game and it feels soul-less. I expected better from the developers of the Witcher series as this game misses many things that were in Grand Theft Auto 3 which was 20 years ago.

The only above average part of this game was the story. It was well told and Keanu Reeves was utilized to his fullest potential and did a great job. I also did not have many bugs but there were a few crashes.

Overall this game was overrated and over promised many features, I would wait for a deep sale as its not worth full price."
1609994581,"Story is just one of the best imo, loved it."
1609994560,THE FUUUUTUUUURRREEE
1609994510,"Is this game a buggy mess? Very much so, the graphics also go wonky at times as well. But beneath the chaotic exterior, there is a game full of heart and drive. i don't regret getting this game one bit."
1609994370,"In spite of the bugs I believe this game after some reworks will be widely regarded as ""breathtaking""."
1609994287,Great game cool story and great graphics.
1609994245,"made me horny for metallic, 10/10"
1609994270,"If you are looking for a polished game or are bugged by bugs, I recommend waiting until it gets updated. However, I have only encountered minor bugs in the PC version. It is definitely no in as bad of a state as current gen console copies. There are also exploits some people are angry about, but in my opinion then don't use the exploit if it bothers you?? This game is not going to be the best game to ever be released, nor do I think it is as phenomenal as Witcher 3. However, it is an excellent game that really allows you to choose your play style, has interesting characters and quests, and a crap load of content. I will say I find it more interesting and well executed than a lot of similar games out there and think it would be received much more favorably had it not been overhyped and released before it was ready. Don't let the negative reception turn you away, but look at evenhanded reviews to know what aspects may be unfinished or underwhelming and whether you would enjoy it despite the flaws. Ultimately, it feels like if Deus Ex, Watchdogs, and GTA had a baby. Again, this allows so many ways of playing the game and creative problem solving. However, I recommend not doing every single possible undiscovered point on the map, and sticking to side quests as they are less repetitive than undiscovered missions."
1609994150,"I love the options for creating your own character, the storyline for each origin and gameplay is awesome, physics issues (on the version I'm playing) are the same I'd see in GTA5 and others, so I'm not offended. I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to spend time for the enjoyment."
1609994116,"really boring game, do not buy it now"
1609994066,So many things to do. So many choices. Truly a game for 18+ thats for sure. Spent alot of hours playing :)
1609993907,"I'm running this on an Alienware i7, rtx 2060, and it runs decently well, but a lot of graphic glitches. 

There was an initial let down when I first started this game. I think the intro is a bit wonky, and the game flow takes some getting used to. I will say, when the world opens up, the game hits a good stride. 

PROS: 
The ambiance of the world is done really well. Some of the greatest moments are going from one job to the next, just taking in the scenery. 
Side missions are integrated really well into the game world, keeping the pace going. 
Customization options and gear are both plentiful. 

CONS:
Aside from the feeling that this game is still early release, bugs, unfinished areas, not much interactivity with the world, the biggest con is subjective, in that a lot of the RPG elements I was hoping for ended up not being present. It really does feel more like a Rockstar game than an Obsidian or Bethesda game, for better and worse. 

OVERALL:
This game is taking a lot of heat for years of irresponsible game production. Bethesda and Bioware have both released games this flawed, and I think gamers put their foot down on this one. There's a good game here, and I'm eager to see what the DLC brings, but you will get plenty of bugs, way more than a AAA game should bring, but I'm still enjoying the overall experience. Buyer Beware."
1609993751,"Great game - not legendary, doesn't quite live up to the hype, but quite good. The story is fantastic, gameplay is good, builds are interesting (netrunner is godlike). It does need some polish, but overall, I think this will only improve with time."
1609993716,"A buggy mess, i love every second of it"
1609993672,I have no idea where my preorder bonus is or how to access it! Please help.
1609993581,Excellent game.  Like GTA in an Altered Carbon world.  Played the whole thing in VR using VorpX.  Was great.
1609993493,"As expected it was buggy but i did not experience any major bugs that ruined my whole immersion in the game, but the thing that did ruin my whole experience were the npc's i'm not talking about the side characters i'm talking about those npc's that you most commonly see in the streets it felt like they were lacking something. But the great things about this game is that you will definitely fell immersed in the game because you will really feel that the side characters such as mama welles, viktor, panam etc. care about you and they treat you as a real friend you don't feel that they are v's friends you feel like they are you're friends and i really liked that. now i will talk about the cars... a lot of people don't like the cars but for me i kinda got used to it its not like the worst car mechanics but its also not the best. The cars that you get late game are very good one time i was just driving in this long tunnel and i came across a free car it was called the caliburn and it was very very good its fast and handles well and i liked the attention to detail when it comes to the cars. now the side missions random encounters and just the things you can do that is not part of the main story are just amazing i was astonished by the amount of side quest and random encounters in the game it prevented the world from looking empty. Now the combat... i liked the combat because of the high recoil on the guns it felt great for me a CS:GO player i'm used to high recoil guns but for the people who don't like them you can get the smart weapons and they are quite good. So the overall performance of the game in my pc is decent i play at medium settings and i get about 40-60 fps it drops when i go in third person inside of a vehicle but its definitely playable i enjoyed the whole game and i want to keep playing more. The staff of CD PROJEKT RED will never not surprise me +Respect!!                                                                                                             

And for the people the want to know the pc specs that i used for my 45 hours gameplay here it is.

1609993339,"First off, I would like to start this review by mentioning how disappointing the dick customization is in this game. When I first heard that you could customize, your penis in cyberpunk, I assumed that we were getting a penis slider. Something where you adjust it to the exact inch you want. Instead I was presented with either small, default, and large options. Since this game is set place in the future, I was also expecting cybernetic dick options. Such as a chrome penis or RGB lighting on my dick. Now that I got my biggest complaint out of the way let me talk about some of the other not so important faults. The glitches in this game can range from funny to game breaking. The funny ones being characters pissing through their pants or cars falling from the sky. Not so funny ones being glitched out checkpoints, skipped dialogue, npcs not being where their supposed to be and much more. I have played early access title that were in better shape than this. I didn’t have to spend $60 on those games either. I had high expectations for cyberpunk and this game couldn’t even reach the bare minimum expectations of a full priced game. Even taking the glitches out of consideration, this still is a very flawed game. The environment is no where near the level of detail of a Rockstar game or a lot of other open world games in the genre. There are some things to love about this game. The game world is beautiful from a distance. The parts of this game that are finished are quite good and detailed. The shooting is a little dated but better than your average rpg shooter. Some of the plot is filled with too much lore exposition but the characters are very well written. Without the glitches this game would probably be a very solid 7/10 but in its current form I cannot recommend it."
1609993334,im having a good time
1609993055,All I did was look at boobs for 95 hours
1609992931,"a worse gta but with a better story

disappointed there wasn't more cock customization though."
1609992916,not bad
1610053396,"good game, but expect a ton of bugs "
1609992703,"Cyberpunk 2077 is one of only about 4 Triple-A games worth giving a shit about. Yes, the game has its problems, namely the beehive worth of bugs. But look past that and you have an immersive world, strong and well-written characters, Keanu Reeves, and a bomb-ass soundtrack.

However, the game (as you would expect from a massive Triple-A title) has problems and missing features. A few examples include a lack of an actual faction system between the various gangs, more in-depth character customization and the ability to alter appearance during the game, patching out all the hilarious and also problematic bugs, like the various random T-poses and also trees and bushes rendering through all other scenery.

Also putting more crunch on your developers than Nestle puts into candy bars. Yeah, that's a big problem, too.

Overall I would still recommend this game if you can push past all the negatives. I chose to view most of the really minor bugs as part of the narrative. Really added to it."
1609992575,"Pros:
- Great main story
- Fantastic side quests
- beautiful soundtrack
- Most intricate game world I've ever seen
- Hacking is a blast

Cons:
- Pretty buggy
- Lackluster choices
- Wanted system is a joke 
- Bad keyboard and mouse support

Hopefully they will fix a lot of this stuff throughout this year."
1609992234,Game is a little buggy but extremely amazing and dialog is amazing even the sexual content and everything
1609991934,Story is really good. I only crashed once alongside only handful of bugs. Car textures not loading in is the only thing I've noticed but restarting usually fixed it. Btw my computer is not amazing.
1609991883,this game on pc is just amazing even better if you have a rtx gpu way more enjoyable 2060 tho isn't really suitable imo I would get a 2060 super if you can my 2070 super run it just fine fun game tho
1609991837,jj
1609991731,"Has to be one of my favourite single player stories to date, had an absolute blast with CB2077. (p.s. play ALL the side missions to get the most out of it, all the side characters are fantastic)

It's buggy yes - but i never experienced anything game breaking and got more laughs out of it then frustration.
"
1609991701,"A HOT MESS. Bunches of bug, glitches but i still enjoy every part of the game"
1609991663,"So. I'm going to Preface this 'No' with a 'No, Not in it's Current State' Message.
I'd give it an 'Eh' Option but Steam doesn't play that game and I cannot, truly, give a yes to the game in the current state. There are hundreds of others that have expressed this, better, so I'll just cover the basics in my eyes.

Cyberpunk 2077 is a pretty damn good game for a First-Person RPG Shooter. It does and exceedingly good job of immersing you within it's world and, had CDPR had more time, I'd have guessed they would hit their 'End Goal'

I've completed this game, twice, since it came out within my 100 Hours. 30-Hours for the First Playthrough and 70 for the Second which I completed most, not all, of the content and while the characters are memorable, believable, this only stretches out to the characters who have been given Voice-Acting and roles within the story/side-quests. 

Aside from the good story and poor AI - Cyberpunk needs work. It is a buggy mess and I'm 100% in belief that they pulled shit out to make it work given the short period. We can yell at them but we also asked for this when they couldn't delay it, again, in December due to the sheer amount of death threats they got for November.

B+ Game - Hope to see more of the game in the coming months as we get closer to the 'Finished Product'
"
1609991616,"It's Blade Runner Skyrim. It's good enough, maybe more of a sale buy than full price, but well worth a play if you're a fan of the Cyberpunk setting, or the gameplay of Fallout without the VATS system"
1609991509,"It took it a few patches to be playable, but now I can say that it was worth the wait. I love it, could not re ccomend it more"
1609991154,"It's a good game. Strong story, and lots of stuff to clear off the map. Already on a second playthrough. The beginnings don't really affect the game that much, but they help to set the tone of a certain character you're going for. Hope they release a lot more for the game."
1609990981,"This is probably the most controversial game of the  last 10 years.

I 100% recommend this game. Why? Because while it do have glitches, and while it do have bad cop spawn location (tbh this isnt a GTA game, or at least I didnt play it like one). The story is downright amazing, and I mean it. Very few games manage to leave me emotionally empty like this one did.

I'm still unsure if I want to do a second playthrough, not because it's difficult or buggy, just because idk if I can emotionally take it.

"
1609990922,Really fun shooter
1609990846,"A few bugs but the story line makes up for it. A grade ""A' game that will suck you in. I have not been this into a title since Fallout 4."
1609990671,"A good, unfinished, buggy game. Can't recommend this game for $60 dollars."
1609990483,Can't forgive the blatant marketing lies
1609990334,"Put aside the few bugs (reminds me of Skyrim, couldn't stop playing that), this game is really fun to play."
1609990325,Amazing story and attention to details.
1609990276,ok
1609990012,"Speaking solely as a pc player with a mid-tier pc, this game is great. The side quests are fun and exciting. The game is a little unstable. After 60 hours, game crashed about 6 times. Overall would reccomend for pc players who can manuver around some euro jank."
1609989991,"Only good part of the game is the soundtrack, everything else was half baked and sucked"
1609989921,.
1609989706,"It has it's faults, but it's enjoyable."
1609989678,"This is the best game since RDR2.  Just make sure you are running it on a liquid cooled i9 with an RTX 3090 and you won't have any issues :-)  PCMR only.  All others need not apply. Ascend people, seriously!"
1609989633,Buggy game but a fun story.
1609989509,"keeps crashing, even sends reports to notify them that it keeps crashing yet nothing seems to be getting fixed from the issues. mostly everyone posts stuff about the crazy crashes they get or the off the wall gliches that happen but they just keep going on, someone must have been looking to get paid instead of wait for the game to be ready on this one. its a great game if they could just figure out these crashes that happen multiple times during your game play."
1609989509,"Not nearly buggy as often reported, at least for me."
1609989480,"Even with some glitches this is easily a great game! Give the Dev's time to work out the glitches, and it could easily be a legit contender for Game of the Year!"
1609989332,"Besides all the bugs everyone's heard about, there's not much to the story. By the time things start to really ramp up, the main story is over- not to mention most of the endings are pretty disappointing. After about 60 hours the side missions begin to feel repetitive, too. Honestly, I'd wait a year or two until everything is fixed, and more content is available because right now, there just isn't enough."
1609989322,"The game isn't without its bugs and flaws, but it's been an enjoyable ride with a world full of charming little surprises and interesting stories, even outside of the main quest, and definitely work experiencing. It might be worth your time holding off a few months and buying the game on sale, by then I'm assuming the majority of the bugs will be patched and you'll save yourself a few bucks too."
1609989308,"I'm gonna begin with yes this game is full of lag, bug and anything that can make someone angry at a point where they decide to quit and never play the game again. I almost did the same thing and get a refund but you know what, I let it one more chance and god knows that the story is EXQUISITE but the lag did make me mad sometime when I was into it. The customisation is quite not there but still have a lot of choice about the dress. The car are uncontrollable and cannot be customize but still fun. At the end its a game where you just to relax and take a deep breath because sometime “It’s hard to see things when you are too close. Take a step back and look.” ― Bob Ross"
1609989300,there are a few minor bugs with textures taking a while to load properly.  otherwise great game love the story.
1609989172,great game. Although could do without the constant crashing and glitches.
1610002094,"In short:

Undoubtedly one of the best games released this year, despite all its bugs and stability issues, with its strong suits being a remarkably lifelike open world, an amazing soundtrack, and a laudable story that paints a believable corpo-fascist future. I wouldn't recommend playing this game on anything less than mid-tier hardware. I'd rate it a solid 8/10, setting aside the bugs, but no higher.

Pros:
- Massive, gorgeous open world that is more ""lifelike"" than any other I've seen to date
- 100+ hours of content
- Brilliant writing that asks all the right ""what if"" questions about a future governed by corporations, one that trades empathy for progress, also shifts the standards of morality - there are no or very few ""right"" choices
- Interesting, diverse set of characters
- Keanu Reaves is breathtaking, though I wish I could say the same of his performance across the board
- Solid combat and progression system, though there's very little in the game that challenges you to innovate with your build and truly use your head

Cons:
- Several bugs, performance, and stability issues.
- Convoluted city design that can at times make traversal frustrating
- The writing may be stellar but much of the extended story is delivered through text - reading several paragraphs of lore may be a little too taxing for some
- Side mission quality is a far cry from that in The Witcher 3 - few have unexpected/unique premises
- The progression system may be fleshed out but the simple challenges the game presents often make it feel frivolous"
1609988979,while the game does have some bugs i haven't had any issues i haven't had in games like Skyrim.
1609988929,"It may have a few bugs those of which are only small bugs and nothing much, but overall this game is one of the best open world games I've played so far."
1609988907,"Fun. Bugs and all, it's still fun. Will continue to be fun. I simp the f out for Judy and FemV"
1609988585,"It took me awhile to realize this game is complete garbage.  I felt like most, beautiful, good story, small glitches.  That is all a giant lie.  Its a glitched out boring story that is unplayable.  Having to replay missions because the game failed to load correctly is unacceptable for a game that cost $1.  They should be issuing refunds like No Mans Sky."
1609988567,..
1609988249,"This game's public complaints and negative reviews are all biased and hypercritical. Every game has bugs, and this one isn't an exception - but they REALLY aren't that bad. I love this game and I love CD Projekt Red (Witcher 3 is my all time favorite game ever made)."
1609988174,"I'll keep it short:

As of right now, after roughly 22 hours of playing Cyberpunk2077... I have lost all interest in continuing.  Many immersion breaking bugs, yes... but what I've noticed with the time I've spent is how hollow and empty this world feels after you get through the ""glossy paintjob"".  When I lose the urge to play a game (when I'm not really thinking about it anymore between play-sessions)... it's not a good thing.

This one took a shot, but really just feels empty and hollow to me.
Maybe try back in a year or two when we get what was ""supposed"" to be released...
But by then, I'm sure I'll be on to the next thing anyway
Shame... it did have a lot of promise
But there are games simply more worth your time than this rushed-to-retail game, both this gen and last gen

If you want to roll the dice, come back in a year or two and see what's up...
But by then, I'm sure there'll be something more exciting to play anyway...
Timing is everything

(Apologies to the Devs... but this shouldn't have been released in this state)"
1609988116,Great Game
1609987985,"Funny graphical glitches? Check. RPG-lite? Check. The occasional crash and horrible voice acting? Check and check. Fun as hell to play? ABSOLUTELY! I'm into it. If this ever becomes multiplayer, holy moly, look out."
1609987675,"I'm tempted to give Cyberpunk a 4/5 for bugs, but honestly? I've played so many games with fantastic polish that didn't have half the story chops. And, I've played buggier games, truth be told. The fact is, despite all the issues, you can really tell the amount of work that went into this, and I think it's fantastic. 5/5 going back for my second playthrough now."
1609987622,An unrefined gem.
1609987558,"Basic Looter Shooter with ""RPG elements"" (its now an Action Adventure game on their official game website it was an RPG), Keanu Reeves Sim 5.5/10 (average game)  
I did like the gameplay but the world felt empty and lackluster, could've been a great game.

"
1609987462,"Graphics are amazing 9.5/10
Talents and abilities are amazing 10/10
Story and character development is perfect 10/10
Quests and gameplay are immersive and keep you busy. 10/10
Side quest NPC background is just as immersive as the main story."
1609987305,"While this game has gotten hammered recently for being buggy, and there are bugs, this game is still fun and well worth the money on PC. When you compare it with other RPGs like say Bethesda titles, it fits right into that category of a fun to play RPG with a good story and with bugs, which occasionally disrupt playability. The good news is CD Project Red is actively releasing patches and bug fixes as well as community modders who are making mods that make up for many of this games shortcommings. While this is not in the Witcher 3 category of excellence, it is still a really good game and worth getting on PC. (I can't speak for console players, who seem to be having a worse time.)"
1609987192,"  Best way to really capture how I felt after playing Cyberpunk is talking to a girl for 7 years online and begging to meet her, only to find out she is a man named Dennis and the only real pics of him you received were the booty pics, but you decided to keep the relationship going because you're too proud to admit you got your hopes up. Besides, he still looks kinda good in that dress. Even with his flaws.

Pros-
Graphics
Overall story
Combat (for awhile, becomes stale and repetitive)
Memorable characters 

Negatives-
No real sense of choice in dialogue and narrative
Weapons feel copy pasted. Even iconic weaponry is typically lackluster with a feature or two sprinkled 
Progression feels unrewarding with stat boosts rather than more dynamic combat/exploration experience
Factions are rarely interconnected and the AI within have only the sole purpose of being shot 
There is no real sense of value to money. Cyberware is the only worthwile purchase
No casual diversion or nightlife activity to take part in. Even with the impressive amount of NPCs roaming the streets, Night city starts to feel dead and everyone in it is static
The Crafting system is broken and kind of pointless anyways




"
1609986862,"Some bugs, yes, but an excellent game otherwise. Complex if you want it, simple shooter if you don't. Hacking is enjoyable. Driving is a bit marred by sluggish responsiveness but bearable on a controller."
1609987099,"[h1]Wait for patches - Meaning wait for the game to be done. [/h1]

CDPR has always acted smug about how they ‘aren’t like the other game developers’ and are the good guys among the big evil EAs and Ubisofts. I think this release has shown this is not the case. CPDR is a large corporation and should be held to the same standard customers hold EA or Ubisoft. This doesn’t mean I dislike the game. I went in blind and had fun with Cyberpunk. But I also had fun with EA games and Ubisoft games – and they proved to be much more technically competent. 

I cannot recommend buying this game right now unless they mark it Early Access. In the future, if things are fixed and the game is in an acceptable condition, I will recommend it to my friends. For now, I am warning them to stay away. For all the marketing and press releases about the game coming out 'When it's ready' and being ‘as polished as Red Dead 2' the state of this game is laughably bad. For example, I had a developer’s voice line play in the middle of the actor’s lines during the sidequest that’s a reference to The Office. Although this is charming for Oblivion’s beggars – in a game that is 14 years newer and flaunted to be a new industry-standard, it is just embarrassing. Wait for patches - meaning wait for the game to be done."
1609986681,"Missing basicly any features that would make the game fun to play, no car customization, all choices lead to the same results and only fool you into thinking they make any significant difference, very buggy, cut scenes and conversations with NPC are long and drag out. terrible compared to all the hype. compared to GTA 5 this is extremely limited and boring to play...."
1609986591,haha hey guys
1609986539,Its fun but it's broken
1609986496,Good idea. Poor execution
1609986332,"Some bugs but, otherwise a great game. Having a higher spec helps smooth out the minor performance issues. Take the story at your own pace trying to speed run the story will likely not feel good."
1609986300,Good graphics could be better but still a great game so far
1609986297,Been a William Gibson fan my whole life. This definitely scratches the itch there.
1609986290,"yes
game good
"
1609986236,"It makey my pp hard when the sex happens
"
1609986120,"Very disappointed, needs another couple of years of work, clearly should have been reduced in size (the map), as there are so many areas that are unfinished.

NPC models, its like the same 10 walk past you dressed differently all the time, could cut the numbers by half and would make the issue so much less painful to see.

Wish I could get a refund, 1/10 stars"
1609985954,"I don't really mind the small glitches, and I haven't experienced anything gamebreaking except when I jumped off a building, healed myself, took a couple of steps and then died randomly. But it was more funny than annoying. I enjoy it."
1609985695,Its a fun game.. but not for children there is naked people and gory look at this review all parents say no to your kids if they want it. ps- sorry kids
1609985587,Recommended on PC only at this stage if you have a graphics card that can handle it. The writing and gunplay is fantastic and makes up for the so-so RPG elements. Wish it were a straight up action adventure game.
1609985490,"Great game! It does have some glitches, but nothing that has made the game unplayable. The side missions are just as in-depth and fun as the main missions. The game is a bit overwhelming at first, but you begin to get the hang of it within a few hours. There are many different paths and options in regards to the story line. The missions offer a great level of diversity. Contrary to what people are saying, I'm glad I purchased the game and would recommend it."
1609985488,Bugs?  I call 'em features... But seriously they did a good job with this.  I'm having fun.
1609985469,Fortnite dog guy POGGERS.
1609985278,Haven't had this much fun since the release of GTA V! As long as your system can run it I highly recommend!
1609985207,"Runs on high on my laptop, Ryzen 5 3550H & GTX 1650. Visually, it would look better on modern hardware. I've had no glitches or bugs so far though."
1609985175,"great story and gameplay, but to many bugs please fix!"
1609985125,yep
1609985075,"ждем оптимизации, и более быстрой подгрузки моделек и все будет ок ачо)0))"
1609984885,"Got as far as character creation to see the games developers had bent to this 2020 ""pick my gender"" bullshit by allowing you to create male chars with female voices and actual vaginas. Yes really.

from this point, I don't even care how good the game is. Anything that supports this absolutely ridiculous gender neutral bullshit deserves a minus 100 out of 5.

If you are unable to detect the difference between a man and a woman you deserve to be hung drawn and quartered. fuck off."
1609984805,Not as bad on PC than on console. Glitches and bugs are part of the fun lol. There have been many fixes since the game came out and is a great buy if you're into a good story and replayability.
1609984778,its good just it doesnt run that well with a 1050 ti
1609984578,Great game. Got a 5700xt and it runs great at 1440p medium/high settings. There are a few weird glitches but those are quickly getting ironed out. Idk so far so good the story is cool and the graphics are nice. 60/69.
1609984535,FIX BUG and GLITCHES
1609984407,"Very fun, story is great, I love the game, there are a few bugs here and there but nothing game breaking, graphics are beautiful. Would recommend 9/10"
1609984390,Wait until it's patched
1609984232,this game is awesome if you can run it.
1609984078,"despite the bugs this game is amazing i love it to bits and i would play it all again an again people that complain about this when really its not that bad glitch's are funny just some people don't have a sense of humour.

story 10/10 made me feel i was there <3"
1609984043,"game really buggy
game really fun
keanu reeves"
1609983818,"great game
good rpg elements and tons of content to do"
1609983810,"I completed my first playthrough in roughly 50 hours but there was more side stuff to do, I just wanted a fresh start and am now on my second run. Fantastic story, really cool vibe all the way through, decent crafting system. Good options for role playing but the attribute/perk system doesn't feel integral to the roleplay aspects. By the time you hit the level cap, there won't be enough attribute and perk points to fill in more than two complete skill trees so choose wisely from the start. The weapon system is cool, feels like there is a lot of variety and it doesn't devolve into stealth sniper class every time. 

There are minor bugs, I have only had one crash and it was because my room got too hot and my computer overheated not because of the game (I think). Few bugs here and there but nothing gamebreaking. Runs well on medium-high graphics settings on my 3700x & 5700xt system. If you are the type of person that gets picky about frame drops and minor bugs, wait a few months and I'm sure they will have most of that ironed out. If you were fine with playing any of the fallout games at their launches, you'll be fine with this game as-is."
1609983804,e
1609983771,"Look. Its a little broken. But its not a bad game overall. I so far like the story. And there is only a few penises around. A decent amount of titties. Only about two or three vaginas.

To be real, this is Romans dream world if your asking me."
1609983584,"I put 103 hours into this game the first week I had it. Did pretty much everything there was to do except a few achievements and a couple endings. It's a fun game if you don't run into the bugs that crash it. I'd recommend it, but maybe wait a month or two for more bug fixes and hopefully the first DLC."
1609983580,Pretty...pretty... pretty good.
1609983524,"Is it enjoyable? Yes. Is it Buggy? Also Yes. With some more polish, some more of the promised features, it could definitely be the triple A game we were promised. I've played it through twice, and it's still fun, but some of the bugs really break immersion."
1609983205,good
1609983107,"While the game needs to be optimized better, the story and characters are un-forgettable."
1609982946,"[h1] First Playthough [/h1]

My first playthrough of Cyberpunk 2077 was very enjoyable, while the game didnt run smoothly with heavy demands of my GPU (RTX 2060 OC Super), it still looked incredible on medium graphics. The game recommends being installed on an SSD, i didnt listen and put it on a HDD... big mistake. Make sure you put game on SSD. Other than those issues of performance and slight bugs, it didnt totally ruin the story for me. I had a bunch of fun playing it. At time of typing (33 hours), i have just finished [spoiler] the Panam and Aldecado's playthrough of the final mission [/spoiler]. This game has some very emotional parts, (especially the end) and had me very invested in [spoiler] V's health and the Question of; ""Will 'V' survive? Will he live?"" [/spoiler]. Most interactions had me do a quicksave because i wasnt sure how a interaction would turn out, trying to get a relationship for 'V', or get the best possible outcome of a sticky situation.
The combat was enjoyable, especially when you get mantis blades, BOY ARE THEY FUN.

So with that First Playthrough done, I do intend on going through it again and choosing different dialogue options, different ending mission teams. Overall, Very fun game, and I do recommend playing if your PC is up to Spec. Preem"
1609982876,love it
1609982684,Amazing Story! Haven't ran into that many glitches but you should be aware of them.
1609982556,"I have been awaiting for the release of Cyberpunk since first hearing it announced. Even with bugs here and there, this game did not disappoint as I sunk hours upon hours late into the night getting lost in that of Night City. Playing through every, single side quest and the determination to 100% this game, I ended up falling in love with another title. Something I hadn't done since obsessing over the Metal Gear series. 
Character building/development brought me to really grow on my own character as well as the others who surrounded me. I hadn't had a game in so long bring such emotion out of me, it was such a nice escape from the claws of the real world. And as much as I fell in love with this game, I also had my heart broken when it had finally came to an end. 
All in all, I loved the difference in gameplay for this game, enjoyed the characters I got to meet and bond with, and felt every pain for any consequences that came to light during my gameplay. This game is officially my new favorite, and I cannot wait to see what Cyberpunk has for us in the future."
1609982420,"First of all, if people hate on this game just because of the bugs and glitches then screw off, they are not game breaking like Fallout 76 or State of Decay 2. Cyberpunk is an experience ive been wanting for a very long time, and its similar to a lot of things i love. It has a fantastic story with characters that grow onto you very quickly, the setting and city is beautiful day and night, the sound track bops so hard that just wants to make you drive around Night City just for the song to finnish. The gameplay is very fun in my opinion, i love all the ICONIC weapons and the cybernetics such as the mantis blades. bugs and glitches will be fixed overtime, but you cant really fix bad stories, so i am glad the everything else is amazing. i highly recommend this to anyone who is willing to be patient with devs. its a fantastic game. 8.5/10"
1609982388,not nearly as bad as people say
1609981941,"More so of a placeholder review, just want to let people know that the recent hotfixes have drastically improved my game performance on a 5-year-old PC (i5 6600k, 8GB RAM, GTX970). Only get very occasional pop-in and only had one instance where my framerate dropped below 20fps since launch (Was a nighttime car chase in rain) since launch.

So far the game is ok, it definately did not live up to the hype so far but the narrative is pretty decent right now. If you go in with little expectation, you'll probably enjoy the game a bit more."
1609981883,"I came here knowing what i was buying and I was happy with the purchase. I suggest looking into the game before you buy it. I ran into a bunch of glitches but like i said, i knew what i was buying so i just laughed and loaded my recent save file. Simply spam save and enjoy the game. Id rate it 4 tuna grinders and a chicken wing out of 5"
1609985309,Wack.
1609982218,"I honestly don't know where to start with CP2077. I'll ignore everything that was supposedly not added or that didn't make to the final cut as honestly I didn't follow the development very closely so I can only really go on the games merits as it is, rather than how some people believe it ""ought"" to have been based on what CDPR supposedly said.

Judging it by it's own merits as a Triple-A title released in the 4th quarter of 2020 doesn't much paint it in any better light to be honest with you. CP2077 feels like a rushed, unpolished, half-assed, money grab with a celebrity cameo. Honestly as a huge fan of CDPR's work on Witcher 3 it pains me to say this; Cyberpunk 2077 is the best example of the worst way to make a game. 

Graphics
Unpopular opinion; but unless you have an RTX equipped graphics card CP2077 looks pretty average. The contrast of how good CP looks with RTX and without is honestly insane and I really hate CDPR for catering to such a niche audience just to show off ray-tracing and alienating everyone else. I run a GTX1070 AMP Extreme and honestly CP looks very flat even maxed out on my card I was seriously underwhelmed when I first got into the game and had a look around (and I'm not even going to get into the low resolution meshes they used for a LOT of stuff). Yes RTX makes CP look amazing, no denying it, I've played it on an RTX equipped computer but it seems the pitch to Nvidia from CDPR was “screw you if you don't have an RTX card and don't want CP to look like Saints Rows 4 in HD” 

Mechanics
Mostly CP handles quite well, until it doesn't. Other games are clunky and sometimes kinda non-intuitive but CP just feels inconsistent as well. The melee combat is easily the biggest offender as it plays so  . . . I don't even know how to describe it, like wielding a baguette instead of a Katana I guess? That's how if feels. It lacks punch, a sense of gravity and presence. Gunplay is alright though the selection system is quite clunky. The game oddly enough really shines when you go exploring and “free running” for want of a better word as there seems to very few upper limits on how and what you can explore on foot which I really like. Interacting with vehicles, people and 'things' can sometimes be a little hit and miss but that I suppose with eventually be patched out.

Writing
I understand the references to pop culture and works of notable Cyberpunk films, TV and books in some cases and anime but it feels like this is all the writing is; references to other things. It feels like the game has no real identity of it's own. The characters are so cliché it could almost be a parody at times. What makes it more frustrating is that the individual characters while still being essentially weak caricatures of popular cyberpunk tropes are actually believably written and the story is actually not bad at all even if is kinda Ghost in the Shell-esque. .  just without the clever philosophical slant. CDPR are good at writing characters there is no doubt about it but the framing is, just too much cliché.

Game World
In a word; bland. But let me be clear here, it's not bland to look at if that's all you're planning on doing. It's bland outside of the story missions. For a sprawling world there is nothing to do here. There is no living city feel to this gameworld, it is a backdrop, a scene, a pretty picture to be admired from a distance and that at least for the time being is all it is. Pay too much attention and you'll see the same NPC animations, conversations, and often the exact same NPCs over and over and over again. This is the Truman Show and you're in it.  

Game Systems
Mostly non-existent. Game systems are what add believable law enforcement, random encounter and mission givers, odd little quirky characters with a little story of their own, weather systems, a changing temperament in the game world sometimes reactive to the player other times more dynamic in its own right. NPC behaviours etc etc. Seemingly there is none of that here and if there is it is not enough to make you care about it. The ""RPG"" systems in the game are arguably even weaker than the rest of them, in that this isn't and RPG, it's an action/shooter with RPG elements. I didn't expect a hardcore RPG from CDRP but I did expect a better effort than buffs so small in the skill tree I wonder if I never added any points if it would honestly make any difference at all to the gameplay. That and the game makes sure you have what you need to progress so there is no real incentive to build your character up apart from the bolt on Mantis blades and do double jumps, do you need those things? No. And that's the problem.

Overall
CP2077 is a once through kinda game I feel. A reasonable scifi/punk romp for a few hours so long as you don't dig to deep or look too close it's not a terrible game at all. If you haven't got it, wait for a sale, wait for patches and bug fixes, wait for DLC . . . as it is? 

I wish I could refund it."
1609981611,"You mix the overall dystopian future vibe of Deux Ex, the open-world feeling of GTA, the quirky yet borderline cringe humour of Borderlands, the interesting side-quests and characters of the Witcher and last but not least, you add the bugs and lack of polish of pretty any Bethesda game

and you get Cyberpunk 2077. 


P.S. Game is overall amazing, the bugs didn't make me regret buying it. I did not encounter any game-breaking bugs and had 0 crashes in 66h. However, the graphical bugs I encountered in the current version  are definately immersion breaking and constantly remind you that this is an unfinished game that needs some serious patching."

1609980544,Exceptional
1609980494,"I understand with all the bugs and news everyone was a bit disappointed, to be honest I'm very happy with it.
It's a massive game, and the amount of attention to detail is phenomenal, and I don't mean oooh look at the pretty lights and graphics (those are nice too) but I mean the detail to the world, making it believable, and feel alive!! CDPR also did really well with this in the Witcher 3 and we can see it carried over. The voice acting is impressive the sheer quantity of it and the quality of it! You can feel the emotions even in the sound bites and barks, they don't feel like random nonsense they feel real, each npc feels like they have a story, even if a number of them are just there, they still feel apart of the city. 
In a lot of games they try to force a connection with characters in a short time, and in most games it falls a bit short, the player doesn't always feel that attachment even if the character they play as responds as such. I find this happens to me in most games, however I want to credit the writers here a lot, the connected feeling with some the characters in NC just feels so much more powerful!  I could go on for a while about all sorts of little things in this game to people aren't talking about, but i genuinely feel this game is best experienced without walk-throughs, without outside opinions, and without outside judgement. Play, learn and discover on your own, it really adds to the story, in some cases you might feel a bit lost or unsure about the decisions you made, and that's the beauty of it!!! That's what makes it so great, it feel real, there are so many way to play and enjoy it. (less spoilers the better it is)

ALSO: if you want the best experience yes play it on PC the patches help, and they're still updating, so be patient and enjoy! The best games I've played all have silly bugs, that's part of the joy!
If you do want to minimize them, close and re open every few hours. (you should anyway go outside get some fresh air, eat, sleep, do some other stuff to :P  )"
1609980196,Good game.
1609980168,"So, I've waited for a while before doing a review on this game. I really wanted to get a good grasp with it before coming to any conclusion. I can't really compare this game with any other AAA title as this is the first one I've bought in a long long time.  That being said, I have to say that I am thoroughly enjoying my experience so far. I know the bugs were a big thing when it released, but honestly, I haven't had too much of an issue.  I bought the game the day after launch and I've ran into a few bugs here and there, but none that were really detrimental to my game-play experience.  I've had item detail windows that wouldn't leave the screen until I hovered over the item again, small glitches where for a split second, my character would appear above my vehicle with arms spread and no pants on, but that has only happened while driving under bridges for some reason and it doesn't last longer than a second.  One recent mission was a bit glitched where i was to jack into a van that was parked with enemies surrounding the area, I was able to walk right past every one of them and complete the task before any even realized I was there. Then the objective updated for the mission, but never updated for the mission details and kept saying I had to jack in to the van.  This wasn't a big deal as the next objective still popped up and I was able to click on it in order to know where to go.  The story line is diverse and interesting. The side missions are also engaging enough to not feel like filler content.  I've completed a good bit of the main story line, but have started venturing out and exploring more side missions and other content like character development and crafting. There are numerous ways to build your character and play the game. I've really enjoyed playing this game differently from the standard run and gun style where you just kill everyone in your path.  Don't get me wrong, there have been times where I've ran in and killed everyone, but I've also relied on stealth and hacking a lot in order to get through areas.  Overall, I'm really enjoying the game and I wouldn't listen to the people that just wanna complain. Now enough typing... I'm gonna go play some more Cyberpunk..."
1609980128,yee
1609980113,"I would recommend this game... BUT a few things I need to point out. The game can be very buggy, the patches have made it more playable, but still very buggy. The gaming mechanics could use some more work in my opinion. The gun fights are really cool and the way the guns shoot are really good. But as far as physics In the game, the way npcs move and what not... its not up to par. They could've learned A LOT from Red Dead 2. But i can say the graphics are amazing, the theme of the game and the story line is pretty great as well. So that makes up for some of its flaws."
1609980078,"Note: This comes purely from my experience with the game. I was exposed to very little of the marketing material, so expectations were much more in line with CDPR's previous works than for some people. I also was lucky to have a PC good enough to run the system and encountered very few bugs, so that will have also affected my outlook. The parties responsible for the abysmal console launch and buggy mess that most people are reporting deserves the heavy criticism that has been received.




This is a recommendation with a caveat. If you were expecting a game that evolves the systems that it shares with many other games, a game that revolutionizes modern RPG gameplay, you'll probably be disappointed.

This game takes much of what CD Projekt was attempting to do in The Witcher 3, and brings it to the next level. Based on the reception of The Witcher 3 you would expect that to be a universally good thing, but to some it appears ridiculous expectations and admittedly poor marketing has lead to the situation this game had found itself in.
    Much like CDPR's previous game, the world is beautiful and feels expansive (here less laterally and more in terms of density), yet is lacking in much content outside of the quests. However, through incredible visual and sound design, the world here is much more immersive to me.
The main story is much more focused here, with both great tense and emotional moments scattered all throughout. Markedly improved voice acting across the board helps enhance this, and the sheer breadth of well written dialogue is both impressive and engaging. Overall it is a highly satisfying story, but the criticism of it's lacking choices compared to the marketing is completely a fair one. Once again, expectations ruining an otherwise great aspect.
Again, much like The Witcher 3, the gameplay here approaches something good but largely serves as something...acceptable to move through the story and world. The shooting and movement doesn't have the satisfying punch of a game like Destiny, but is more than serviceable and the stealth kept me engaged enough through my time.
It takes much of the design philosophy behind The Witcher 3 and attempts to expand on it. For people that expected that, I would say that Cyberpunk over-delivers on those expectations. If you expected more, I would peg that on the marketing (and there is nothing wrong with openly criticising this!).


TLDR: If you enjoyed The Witcher 3 despite its obvious faults and not purely for it's medieval setting, you will most likely quite enjoy this game. Just be sure to look at benchmarks before purchasing to see if you can live with the performance you will get.



P.S.  I have seen a number of videos and posts comparing the game to the Grand Theft Auto series. The comparison is completely fair, though some of these ""takedown"" videos are so blatantly biased and misrepresentative it's embarrassing. The game has many things to criticize (some of which I've mentioned here), but the hatemob approach is pathetic and lying does nothing for the artform.

1609979889,"Played on hardest difficulty, streetkid on PC.  No major issues, gameplay was smooth but after certain point (Level 35ish) game is not challenging (mainly because enemy AI is not great).  Main story line was good but felt a bit short.  Not many twists in the story.  Would have liked if the side jobs were also filled with more story and characters.  For additional kick, would have preferred if there were other mercs (with more difficult AI) coming after player based on choices made or player actions.  Overall enjoyed the game and recommend it."
1609979754,It good.
1609979675," I feel like the game is so far from being AAA it was not worth the money. I tried my best to put up with it and did make it through the main quest twice to see if any difference between corpo or nomad. I spent the money on the game so I felt that I needed to see it all. I completed every side quest and searched the map for hours looking for cool things. I did find a lot of cool stuff, but the game is so broken. All the while I was frustrated with bugs. I kept reloading saves and spent hours figuring out how to pass some game breaking story bugs. I did all this because I spent the money and wanted to try to get my moneys worth. Fallout 4 is better than this game.
 The physics are so bad, the driving is so bad, the bugs are so bad. I am going to uninstall the game now and install Fallout 4 to have my 13th play through. Maybe this game will have work done to make it better, but I feel that it will never be the game it was described as or was meant to be."
1609979565,FULL OF BUGS
1609979509,very big goomba
1609979414,there was clearly a better game planned but they cut so much out of this game its anemic at best. they clearly put a lot of time into building the map and designing but the game was pushed to release before they could build an actual roll play game in it. the bones for a game are there but theres almost no story and absolutely No real roll play options. 2 out of 5 at best wish there was more. If they put back in all the half done and cut content maybe it can be salvaged. Its like half a game.
1609984028,"Solid 6/10 game that really doesn't do anything amazingly well (maybe other than voice acting, writing, graphical fidelity) 

But if you're looking for a strong

RPG (CP2077 isnt really a RPG at all despite how they marketed it)
Even the cyberpunk aspect has been done much better in other titles.

Then you might want to keep looking for another game, however people who are still interested should just wait for a good sale."
1609979130,"If you care about the bugs wait like 6 months for most of them to get fixed.

Overall had a blast, some of the bugs were really funny, some needed a save reload and one bug broke my first playthrough (really mad about that one). Game might be in schambles but it does have some gaming moments."

1609978966,"Despite the rumors that this game was unstable, I am playing it on a computer that is below minimum system requirements and it runs fine.  Not great, but fine.  It's playable and has only crashed once in my 63 hours of gameplay.  Upgrading my computer to be above recommended here in a few days, because I want to see how gorgeous it looks with the video settings turned up.  But, even if I wasn't upgrading my PC, I would still keep playing.  Spectacular game.  May or may not live up to the hype, but that's just a result of it being in the making for so long.  It's a still a game at the end of the day.  It's not a unicorn, but it is at the same time.  Usually I wait for games to get cheaper, but this one is, in fact, worth full price."

1609978385,"If i had to sum it up in few words:
Its Grand theft auto V, set in the future, with a re-skinned, crappy, PoS witcher 3 Console port game engine. Story, dialog, voice acting and graphic source quality is top notch but the game engine screws it up to the point of sadness and dismay, if projekt red had hired whom ever did Death Stranding to do the technical side this would have been the highest quality game ever hands down, and Jackie and Keanu really bring it home.

Graphics Quality (Engine):7
Graphics Quality Effort (Graphical Source File Quality): 10
Voice acting: 10
Open Worldness: 9
Stability:5
Q&A: 3 (some bugs were just apparent from the second the game started, not 3 minutes into the game theres things you cannot loot...)

Notes:
In full projekt red fashion the technical aspect of it is EXACTLY the same PoS console port like witcher, It took me at least 12 hrs of restarting the game every few minutes to hack the configuration files and reprogram all the keybindings to where its useable. and the bugs jesus.... crashes, cant loot or click things, quest items explode, overlay gets screwed and you have to reload the game, etc etc....

Wait for sale or for a potential massive update or dlc to arrive before maybe buying it."
1609977470,It's okay.
1609977488,"Yes, the game has a lot of glitches, and some are very aggravating, but:

    [*]the gun play isn't special, but it's very satisfying
    [*]the driving is so much fun with practice
    [*]the music is awesome
[/list]

If you look at the glitches in the perspective of a game like Skyrim, and that they add to the charm and create some funny moments that break the tension of the angsty CP2077 story, they become so much more bearable and are something to look forward to.

I had so much fun playing this game, and I cannot wait for the DLC. The ending is most definitely the most satisfying I've ever experience in video games if you [spoiler] romance Judy and get help from Panam [/spoiler]. 10/10, amazing game, def gonna get a 2077 tattoo."
1609976976,"Yeah the game is buggy as hell but... that's kinda a big part of what makes it so fun? So long as you can run the game with decent graphics the game is tons of fun. It's been a long time since I've had a game I can just sit back and play alone.
I've yet to encounter anything game breaking, but luckily you can just load a previous save if something like that occurs. My only grievances are that there are no cat ears/cat ear headphones for my character to wear and I haven't found a quicksave button/keybind to avoid going into the menu every time I'm bout to do something real stupid."
1609976959,cyber titties
1609976768,"Broken, but lots of potential."
1609976676,"This game is huge!!! 

Pros: After playing 175 hours.  I want more. Without getting into spoilers. I wish the relationship aspects were much longer. First time I every truly wanted a companion in a game! These characters grow on you! I think all the romance characters should be along for the ride longer, with more mission. (Panam is my favorite, Judy second) The weaponry and skill sets we timed out pretty well if you played fair. The layout of the map and stuff took a long time to become familiar with but seemed normal (like getting used to a new city, IRL) The graphics on high were great for me.  After the most recent update, and updated vid drivers it was a world of difference. 

Cons: I wish the relationships were longer. LOL I play my character as a moral Assassin! A he fell for Panam. But the game closed for me with a false sense of completion. (Could be personal opinion) The glitching unbearable until the patch. Still glitchy with cars falling out of the sky and weapons or characters mid air.  And for god sake fix the damn driving. Has anyone IRL that coded the game, driven a car? A) You always sit to low in the car to see accurately. B)The sun in your eyes coming out of tunnels was unreal and C) the freaking spinning out all the time was a joke. I would have loved to been able to drive First person, the cars were designed that well. (Could of been on hell of an experience...) The swearing is over the top.  Way over the top.

1609976547,It is buggy and has crashed for me a good bit but i am really enjoying it despite all of that
1609976428,"Yes there are major graphic glitches even on a powerful machine.  Yes there are UI glitches and bugs.  But most of these issues can be resolved (albeit temporarily) by saving/quick-saving and re-loading the game.  It's a 30-second process, give or take, but resolves most issues.  That's not to say it's an excuse, but we know the game will be patched up.  So is it worth playing, well I think so.  The missions are engaging.  The conversations and voice acting are top quality.  The AI can be challenging, when you turn the difficulty up, but there is more work to be done with the intelligence of the AI.  Hacking is completely and utterly overpowered.  I mean that because you can walk around without a single weapon and destroy a group in with one contagion hack.  It's a fun game and has kept me engaged for my minimum 60+ hours for this price tag.  So I would recommend it, even if you have to wait a month or two for bug fixes!"

Real good characters and story. Awesome dialog and choices. Graphics are great. This is a next Gen game, so obviously you do need a fairly good rig to play this very comfortably, if you a super nit picky person. I bought this game knowing i have an old i3 but my other hardware can maybe. compensate some. Almost 70hrs in, after a few patches and i got no regrets.

1609975984,"An actual good game, it just sucks that people tried to convince other people that a lot of the bugs were completely game breaking, which some were but I experienced none. I'm not saying that there is not a possibility of game breaking bugs, they are just rare. Has a really good story and the only bugs I experienced were fun little bugs that did not affect gameplay whatsoever, besides once I got into a death loop while playing as Johnny which was easily fixable and loaded the previous save before the recent autosave."
1609975831,"This game is incredible. I have had zero crashes and only some minor visual bugs. So far I have played 38 hours and still haven't completed the main story line. There aren't many games where I become so invested in the side missions. The characters, animations, and architecture are all so gorgeous.

1609975500,"Is it buggy? Yes.
Is it at times frustrating? Yes.
Is it a fucking blast when it works? Yes.
Was playing it worth it? Yes.
Will I come back when CDPR fixes the game? Absolutely.

This messy piece of shit game ended up tugging at my heartstrings."
1609975265,"So as much as I have subjectively enjoyed this game I cannot suggest you purchase it for yourself. For your consideration my primary playthough was as a stealth hacker character who was specced heavily into quickhacks and pistols (with silencers) although I also played as an open combat character specced into assault weapons and sheer face tanking.

Level Design: This aspect of the game at first seems diverse but as you develop it becomes very formula driven, there are multiple entries to most environments but they almost always boil down to: Shoot your way in or sneak in a side door using your strength or tech stat. then after you've killed or avoided all of the enemies you slap F on a computer and leave the way you came in. While this applies to the side content more than main story, you follow the same formula for both, just the main story has a few cool lines of speech to go with it.

Main Story: So I have played multiple runs now and seen most of the endings. Except the ""Secret"" ending, and I can honestly say I felt pretty good with my first (Panam) the story was solid, felt natural and fluid. I consider this my cannon ending, everything after this though must considered a failure of design. My second run of the game was as a female V, my love interest was not a viable companion for the final quest and the only choice left to me was to fall into the corporate line or die. Worse still was the ""Secret"" sending which I had to follow a tutorial to unlock, and though this would seem like the most natural conclusion for V to arrive at you have to have the approval of the ever arrogant Johhny Silverhand to even comprehend the notion to fix your own problems. Though god help you if you've chosen anything except an open combat character as the silverhand finale mission does not allow for stealth or hacker players to get a look in. If you haven't built around open combat you can kiss common sense goodbye because this ending will put a damage over time on you, remove your heals and drop you to the floor in one hit as a (level 40) hacker while you mash buttons for the 40th time in a 2 hour period only to watch in futile rage as the enemy slowly take the perfect stance to swing down onto your limp corpse and finish V off with less ceremony than that of the singular hookers of Jig-jig street.

Amazing world building, very solid main story (especially compared to Witcher).

Endless bugs, broken mechanics, unbalanced features."
1609974335,"i like the game. if you want to buy the game get it when they add some really cool shit on there, like a dlc or when they get repair man to fix night city."
1609974477,"Honestly? 6/10. I've played 200+ hours now and overall it's just not what was promised. 

Playing on PC I'm benefited with little bugs / issues unlike the console experience has been, so this 6/10 rating comes from my experience of the Story, Mechanics, and Playability. 

Story - It's solid, but not groundbreaking. Say what you want about the dialogue options influence in which I found much to be desired, the story is better written than other AAA games we ought to be comparing this title to. Still, it's A-Tier, not S-Tier. 

Mechanics - Eh. Nothing groundbreaking here. Quickhacks and Cyberware don't bring a new element to gameplay that hasn't been seen in RPGs before. Your ability to run and gun or play it stealth is equal on both sides regardless of what you choose in character stats. Try it, you'll see you can run in with a blunt weapon and no perks on body and still run through a room just because it's a leveled-up weapon and you've perfected crafting. Don't perfect crafting and you can just buy one. The mechanics aren't new, just re-branded.

Playability - Around hour 100 the game becomes a choice. Do you want more cars? More cash? Cooler weapons? Grind and find. At any point you can finish the game, and actually the longer you spend out and about leveling up will just make it easier for you to progress when the desire comes. I found myself doing every mission available to me that was just close to one another so as to save time and be more efficient. As long as you're expectations are deep, rich story lines with each merc quest and cyberpyscho encounter then it'll be manageable. 

Overall, I won't be playing this game again for a long time due to the fact that it's really not that groundbreaking or amazing. Wither 3 blows this thing apart. GTA V is better than this game. It doesn't have that Skyrim effect, that Titanfall 2 ""I wanna pick that back up again"" piece to me. Hope others have enjoyed it more and if you see this on sale one day pick it up, it's an amazing $35 game, but an okay $60 one."
1609974293,the best story game i have ever played.. (if you can overlook some of the bugs)
1609974189,with a top end computer it is very fun
1609974150,It good but sometimes it giltchs
1609974085,"80 hours in and I can safely say that I'm glad I bought this game. I'll likely wait for my second playthrough to be after mods and DLCs are plentiful, but the game has been a helluva trip."
1609973985,Great game. Minor bugs but nothing game breaking. Can't wait to see what the future holds.
1610009644,"Maybe I'm lucky - encountered very few gamebreaking bugs. Only had to reload five times in ~50 hours. 

Honestly I can't remember the last time I had this much fun in a game. Just like when you finish a great tv series, my life now feels empty and meaningless. Don't be a gonk and check out Night City for yourself my chooms."
1609973822,"Currently can not reccomend the game. Even on PC i found myself pulled out of the immersion constantly. The game as a whole seems like it has potential, but that potential is not reached and doesnt seem like its gonna be reached anytime soon. 
Wait for a few months worth of patches and then maybe  take a look. The game runs well on my 980ti all things considered and i did have some really cool moments. But the world of Night City (despite its insanely well crafted environment itself) often gets you intrigued and interested in story lines and characters just for you to encounter a game breaking or weird graphical glitch that pulls you right back out.

Something i was looking forward to, the driving, feels insanely floaty and the combat feels not very satisfying as it lacks proper feedback in my eyes. 
Enemy AI breaks constantly, their tactics are weird at best and you can avoid most combat by just running away or straight to your objective unless its scripted. 
The hacking seems neat but also not very fleshed out while the crafting and upgrade system has serious balancing issues as you can not craft enough upgrades for your gear to ""always wear  the same things"" when you suddenly loot a ugly legendary trenchcoat with tripple the armor. 
As a whole it feels like a beta at best, a prove of concept in some areas while visually it IS stunning, but visuals arent everything.
But the photo mode is neat i guess

Will try to update this review when changes are made that warrant it. Currently i would NOT reccomend it if you wish to get the proper immersive experience it hopefully will be able to deliver someday"

1609973072,scam
1609972982,this games tutorial or main campaign is so long in the beginning and the graphics are not what i expected them to be
1609972770,"DON'T BUY THIS GAME UNTIL THEY FIX THE ISSUES - Game flatlines whenever I try to load it, despite spending around 3 hours following the troubleshooting suggestions.

 System is RTX 2080 Super, i7 10750, 16GB ram, Windows 10 H2 update, overlays off."
1609972751,Like 11/10 grate story grate game even with bugs I cant wait to see what else they do with this game!!!!
1609972544,"I played through the whole game, 80+ hours, and only experienced a handful of minor graphical glitches. Didn't find the game particularly buggy to be honest.

There are certainly fundamental gameplay issues that still exist though. Whether these are 'fixable' is yet to be seen. These include (but not limited to...) 

-a truly appalling police/wanted system, would have been better if they just didn't include police at all.
-woeful enemy combat AI that is not even as competent as the AI from games far older such as the original Half-Life or F.E.A.R.
-lacklustre side missions (despite what most reviewers seem to be saying)
-uninspired perk trees that are mostly just % increases to skills/abilities
-driving is severely hampered by the minimap not being zoomed out enough at speed
-NPCs are mindless automatons and the city, especially in some areas, feels lifeless
-the way you acquire quests is handled poorly, you will find yourself just scouring the map for a new quest. It's incredibly rare that you'll manage to ''stumble'' upon something happening outside of rinse and repeat style ''filler'' content.
-RPG elements feel shallow and meaningless. Your choices don't feel like they affect the world.

Yet somehow, I still really enjoyed the game! Great characters, dialogue and atmosphere all set in an incredible looking city. The combat, when its good, it's great. You feel agile and powerful. Practically parkouring up and over obstacles, sliding around, entering slow motion and landing headshots never felt so satisfying. The irony is that most people wanted a deep, story driven RPG and were willing to overlook potentially janky combat (like The Witcher 3) and yet we've got a brilliant combat system that's fast, responsive and exciting but the RPG story sides feels stunted and weak..."
1609972530,"I really do wish one day Steam would offer a rating system not as easy as ""recommend"" or ""not recommend."" As for now, after a full play through, cyberpunk 2077 stands as a 6.5-7.5/10 game in my book. The one point of fluctuation is due to the potential fixation of bugs, ai, physics, and future DLCs. 
Pros:
1: The Story. Both the main story and the side missions more than often fostered a deep level of thinking about the reality that we live in and some potential outcomes of our future. And there are moments in the story(main and side) where I have got very immersed in it and got rather emotional due to the excellent writings in some parts of the story. However, the story is not all good and beautiful due to a fatal flaw, as I will discuss later in the cons section. 
3: The Music. THE MUSIC IN THIS GAME IS FUCKING BEAUTIFUL.  The vibe you would get when you are driving in your cars in the city in 1st person and with the right music on is truly amazing. And there are countless instances where the music sync perfectly with certain scenes in the story where it took the level of intensity to the next level. My personal fav radio is Body Heat Radio, there are view bangers on it but also has two weird Japanese songs that I hated.
4: The City. I am not talking about the ai or the livliness of the city, I am merely talking about the look of the city. From night city’s general design and layout, it is one of the best maps I have ever encountered. Clearly a lot of work went into the design and planning and the result is beautiful. It really looks like a city from the future, not too far astray from reality, but definitely more futuristic. 
Now we are done with the pros of this game, let’s move on to the cons of this game.
Cons:
1: Bugs and broken ais. Let’s be real here, this is definitely not the first time you hear sb complaining about this aspect of this game, but if this isn’t smth that severely breaks the immersion of this game for me then I won’t mention it. There are so many instances that either the bugs or the ai really fucking breaks the immersion for me. For example, music fail to render in some of the scenes where clearly the intention for it was to be dramatic; I would jump off a 1 meter cliff during a mission and my character would die instantly and perhaps gone with it were some 30mins worth of efforts; and so much more. And I am not even playing this game on consoles. Frankly, in my opinion, the current state of this game on any platform that you prefer is not a fitting for a game that has been developed for nearly a decade. 
2: The emptiness of the city. The city feels dead on so many instances, largely thanks to the broken ais and lack of civilian activities. The gangs are literally pointless, and it feels like they just threw them into this game in order to make those little gang activities take place and make the city not so dead. All you can do aside from the main missions and the side quests is walking around the city and killing some random gang members during those gang activities. And those gang activities aren’t even good lol. I can see so easily something like gang affiliation or joining a certain gang being put into here. And those activities do not even have variations to them. All you do is either stealth or kill, or both. 
3: The huge performance hits and compatibility issue. This game without dlss is borderline unplayable. Even a rtx 3090 card, one of the top of the line graphic cards, cannot run this game constantly over 60 fps at max setting without dlss. Yes, you can still run it on low fps, but with a game that one of its major selling points is its outlook, you are missing out on a lot. And it definitely isn’t your fault that you cannot enjoy this game because of performance issue.  It is the company’s responsibility to make games as hardware friendly to users as possible if one of their major selling points is the look of the game, so that they can ensure at least 70% of the users can see what they envisioned the game to be like. 
4: The endings. 
MAJOR MAJOR SPOILERS TO THE STORY AHEAD
BE WARN
This is my biggest complaint about this game and the reason why I cannot give this game a score higher than 7.5. Cyberpunk does give you a variety of choices, however, there are a few main issues with those choices. Almost NOTHING you do prior to the chippin side quest would influence the outcome of the game. I know how your dialogues with Johnny throughout the game can give you the secret ending, and as a matter of fact, that’s the ending I got. But that is still the only thing that you do that can influence your endings. No side quests other than chippin, no choices you made through the game would impact the endings or give you varieties. And whatever you choose to do during your conversation with Johnny on the balcony, there will only be essentially four endings. And none of those feels as if YOUR CHOICES MATTERED. The variations of the endings is only half of the course to make the endings of a game great, the OUTCOME of the endings determine the other half. But in cyberpunk, nothing you chose or you did throughout the game can give you an ending that you would feel satisfied with your efforts. Like in the Arasaka ending, wouldn’t it be better if they CAN ACTUALLY HEAL you instead of just telling you that you have got 6 months to live like the other one??? Wouldn’t that give you a better reason to choose to side with them instead of just trying to avoid a big fight??? To me, the least thought out ending is the secret ending which was what  I ended up with. The main point of this ending is that you and Johnny got so well acquainted with one another, that Johnny is willing to go down a suicide run to fight Arasaka with you alone and without calling anyone for help. Sounds badass right? But then why the end of this “secret ending”, which is also arguably the hardest ending amongst all others and perhaps the hardest mission in the entire game lead me to exactly the same outcome of another ending that you side with Rogue? If me and Johnny got so “compatible”, and Alt being literally one of the strongest AI, why can’t there be an option to merge my soul with that of Johnny like what we saw in the Delamine quest? Or keep Jonny on my side? Or give the body to Johnny for the next 6 months and then I regain the body? Beware that I am not the only one who is not satisfied with this ending, or the endings in general, in fact, some of the suggestions and ideas about the secret ending’s outcome and that of the Arasaka one that I just mentioned came from a couple comments on youtube from different people who I really agree with. Literally just look up a video about Cyberpunk’s endings on youtube and you will find a bunch of people dis-satified with different endings and offering some really reasonable and BETTER alternatives. In the end, I really just don’t feel my choices being impactful or even meaningful. I am not looking for a perfect ending, or a happy ending where everyone gets saved. Witcher  3 did not offer that, but in Witcher 3, I felt as if my choices in the game did matter to the people I chose to side with and that I got an ending suitable for my own morals. In Cyberpunk, that is not the case, and I am very disappointed to see that being the case. 
Witcher 3 did not come out as a bug-free game, but the story and other aspects of that game outshined the bugs. But in Cyberpunk’s case, the story at least to me did not outshined the bugs. The emptiness I felt at the end of completing Cyberpunk was not due to a sense that “oh what a great game, what am I gonna do now?” but more like a “that’s it?” Unless CDPR do something drastic about the endings in the DLCs to change this current status, this game will at most be a 7.5 and that is that to me.
PS: I kept comparing Cyberpunk to Witcher 3 because it is easy to see the differences between these two games and also with both of them being major projects of CDPR."
1609972430,trash
1609972232,"Game is full of bugs, bad optimization, terrible AI, and poorly designed skill trees which leads to an experience that is full of frustration. The parts that work well (including unique quests and dialogue) do not cover up the parts that are broken. Exploring would appear to be a selling point until you realize that virtually every building/store is locked and the areas that are available are very similar across the game unless you are locked in a quest. The game may be in a better state in a year or so but for now I can't recommend it.
Overall score 6/10"
1609972125,"There are bugs but mostly small visual ones. The only annoying one was one where Audio didn't stop playing when something new happened. 
Aside from that, this game is amazing and I'll definitely recommend it. Great gameplay, stories, characters, what's not to like."
1609972117,Great game and a great story
1609972040,custom cock
1609972027,This is a good game... Now we wait for patches.
1609971999,initially had some pretty bad bugs but the story and dialogue make it all worth it
1609971895,Not impressed. Content is blah at best.  I will give it some time and see if some of the supposedly massive cut content is brought back but as of right now I feel cheated out of $60.
1609971852,"I dont recomend this game just because the price is too high now a days. The reason of this is because there are alot of bugs, you dont taste the history as you supose to. This game is the definition of mistake. Buy it when the price get lower.  Thats my opinion :)"
1609971847,"Great game. It gets more enjoyable as you continue progressing through the story and side jobs. Making the right choices during dialogue can make it even more interesting, especially on ones relating to the path you chose from the beginning. Feels very futuristic and aesthetically pleasing. Highly recommend!"
1609971731,"ALot of glitches with video and game play. Try a beta test next time before releasing what could be a great game. 
"
1609971668,"Bugs were a minor inconvenience at the absolute worst, nothing game breaking. Combat is quite fun, and having finished it a week ago, I can confirm that the story is excellent and something that stays with you even after the game is finished. World is also gorgeous. I highly recommend doing side quests, some genuinely incredible stuff there. First act is somewhat linear and I was mixed on it, but after the title card shows the game opens up and was great."
1609971509,"One of the best games ive played at late, i have a 2,000$ computer and there are a few glitches but everything is all together good"
1609971468,Little bit buggy but still its worth game LIKE !!!!
1609971323,"The story, climax, details, are amazing. Its like Hi-budget sci-fi movie from 90'. Memorable experience, im not dissapointed."
1609971266,Anyone who says the bugs get in the way has no idea what to enjoy about this game. Anyone playing this on a console is also an idiot.
1609971233,"Keep your expectations within the realm of reality and you'll have a great time with this game. If you loved Fallout; New Vegas, Skyrim, or Saints Row and find minor glitches forgivable, you'll love this game too. The artists, writers, developers and other creatives at CDPR have created an amazing experience here. They deserve all the appreciation they can get especially from their higher ups but from the fans as well."
1609971219,Most of what had to be said about this title has already been said by people far most capable than me in reviewing things. I can only add that this is the second game I ever platinumed and it has been a very fun experience.
1609971189,"Despite the backlash (there's ALOT of it). Despite the bugs (even MORE here). Despite the cut content that they  had to cut in order to make release dates/investor deadlines (a CRUD ton of it here).

This game is great. I'm posting this review after 69 hours of street-time earning max rep and only being halfway to max level, which I think is 50. I love it, the sights, the violence, the very vibe of the Cyberpunk genre is what I've been dying for in an open world RPG. The dystopian future where 60's glam fashion and Tron-like, neon garbed technomancers are mashed together with a hint of gutterpunk angst. You lead the life of V. Futuristic mercenary taking odd jobs just to make a living in the chaos of Night City. Whether you rely on brute strength, frightfully accurate ""Smart"" weaponry, calculating strikes with quickhacks or even planning your stealth route using the surrounding surveillance equipment of nearby structures so that you don't have to take even a single shot...

The bugs... There's quite a few. Most aren't game breaking but there are a few that are quite annoying, like for instance a bug where charging a shot from a tech weapon won't work and you are forced to drop the weapon from your inventory just to try and pick it back up, hopefully it doesn't bug out on you while doing so, which can take a lot of time especially if your'e in a firefight. I'm sure these will all get addressed in time but still something to consider when looking at buying a game.

Cut Content. Unsure of how true these claims actually are, but there's enough of them with all of the supporting evidence that they might need to make a case. Small things like customization are missing or seem like they weren't ever finished. There's skins on weapons but you can't apply your own to any, which kind of points to a missing system if you think about it. You can customize your character, sure, but you can't go back to customize the hair or minor cosmetic things, plus it's the future where you can easily change anything about yourself with a chunk of cash, why wouldn't you be able to alter your appearance later on. Idk, I'm not going to continue to complain, there's enough of that going on with everyone on Twitter and Youtube. 

My opinion. Great game. Will recommend to anyone not playing on last gen equipment. Upgrade your gear to enjoy this game. I run on an i5-9600k, with an MSI 1660. Runs great without RTX,"
1609971171,"in the state the game is in at the moment no one should waste their money on this game.

yes the story is great, but it's too damn short.

yes the game looks fantastic in slideshow mode (aka 2fps) 

more visual bugs than any game i've seen before (even beats ubishit) 

a LOT of sound bugs

fucked up skill/reputation system.

1609971144,absolutely phenomenal. dont listen to the haters
1609971130,"""Brokenpunk 76"" Not much to say aside from it's clearly not finished. Don't Buy it until they fix this hot mess."
1609971013,no
1609970985,"It's a fine shooter with a pretty cool storyline .
Just don't go in looking for a rpg because even fallout 4 is more in depth in that way.
The lifepaths don't really do anything apart from giving you a different intro into the game and having some different dialogue options.
Its mostly illusion of choice and while some do affect your ending it is very limited.

Not the best game but certainly not the worst"
1609970908,yes

1609970792,"Pros
====
- Great main story.
- Many hours of addictive Deus-Ex inspired side quests and gigs.
- First open-world futuristic sci-fi RPG in gaming history. We need more of them.
- Beautiful open world.
- Overall great voice acting (except Keanu Reeve's).

Cons
====
- Johnny Silverhand is a nagging annoyance due to poor voice acting by Keanu Reeves, and his rock band quest line, which is mainly a bunch of interactive stories, is a huge yawn.
- Many flying vehicles in the sky, but the player can only drive on land, strangely.
- Bad UI design, ugly main map, bad mini map.
- Terrible driving mechanic.
- Broken major quests and bugs.
- Not a gaming revolution it hypes itself to be."
1609970724,Not very buggy for me looks and preforms great tons of fun though the game feels like its not quite finished which is sad but still worth it to me. Hopefully the DLC will be awesome and fix what little there is wrong with the game. 100% worth it imo
1609970708,haha sex happen in game haha
1609970379,"Yeah, it's buggy and needed more development time, but it's still a top tier game in my opinion. If you can wait a couple of months and play it when it's a bit more polished, great! If not, it's still perfectly playable in its current state."
1609970279,"A good story, good gameplay (yes a few bugs here and there, but nothing too bad...) does it live up to the hype, no. No game ever lives up to the hype of the marketing material IMO. If you play this game for what it is, it is a solid 8/10. I've played through it 2 times (total playtime: 150hrs) So if you can make yourself ignore what this game could have been and enjoy it for what it is, you will realise there is fun to be had...."
1609970258,"Most bugs in the game aren't gamebreaking, and are usually just humorous. Once rock music never went away on during key cutscenes and would repeat on loop so loud that I couldn't hear anything."
1609970178,"After 92 hours of game time and finishing the main quest line twice, I have to say the game is....an immersive hot mess.  The ending is not what I was expecting and a bit of a let down, but still satisfying. The car traffic is entertaining to watch and keeps you on your toes, especially when they make aright turn from the left lane.  But I really like the interaction between all of the story NPC's....Johnny Silverhand is a hoot and I've gotten used to his impromptu commentary.  My PC with a RTX 2080 Super is handling the graphical load quit well at 1920 x 1080 on my curve 32 inch monitor.  Have fun in Night City......."
1609970043,"Das Spiel hätte noch ein halbes Jahr Entwicklung vertragen, ist aber abgesehen von den vielen Bugs (viele wurden inzwischen auch gefixt) der absolute Hammer."
1609970034,"The game is trash until you met:
-Jacky
-Victor
-Johnny Silverhand
-Panam
-Judy
-Takemura"
1609970004,"Amazing game, only get it if you have over the recommended spec though"
1609969994,"Pros:

- Incredible world building, characters, setting. One of the best I've ever played - ever from top to bottom.

-Combat feels good and weighty and fun, you have a variety of options in combat that you can bounce between.

-Core gameplay loop is very satisfying, story and characters all blend together wonderfully.

Cons:

- Melee combat was lacking and doesn't feel good

- Normal difficulty is too easy, games shoves resources in your face, this actually diminishes a lot of interaction you have in the world (further in the game you probably don't need to go to vendors, interact with people for goods, etc.)

- The prevalence of bugs has legitimately ruined thrilling scenes/missions. Characters T posing, entire combat sequences where enemy AI don't detect your presence, V switching from male to female voice lines randomly sometimes."
1609969595,"Love this game, the side missions are so well made and they have their own self contained stories. The game is beautiful, it takes a lot to run so if you have an older system maybe wait for some updates that will help improvement. 
The main story is also very cool and I love the overall themeing of night city. The game has a few glitches but nothing game breaking that I've experienced. Would highly recommend it, the best open world game I've played in a long time."
1609969472,"As of right now there's the obvious issues, glitches, performance issues and the like. But even then I still recommend it, it's such an absorbing experience that its just a good time"
1609969465,has more bugs then an ubisoft and bethesda game. cool world tho
1609969449,Get this game when the 4000 rtx cards come out! you will be dissapointed not able to run this baby the way its meant to be played.
1609969350,"Super fun!
"
1609969309,gud
1609969105,Yes
1609969088,BEEP BEEP MOTHERFUCKER!
1609975985,"The good:
1. The story is interesting.
2. The game is pretty.
3. The music is good.

The bad:
1. Main protagonist is just a mule to carry Johnny, who many times feels like the main protagonist.
2. Romance doesn't matter because other people don't react to your romance choice. (can't ever mention that you are in a relationship with someone when asked).
3. There is no factions/reputation system (Street Cred is a joke) because you can murder any gang members left and right in Night City and nobody cares.
4. You can't be a charming diplomat, a witty merc or a merciless assassin. Your dialogue options are illusions of choice, nothing changes.
5. The world doesn't react to your Street Cred. It's only to get fancy cars and gear upgrades (no region unlocks or fixer unlock, they simply call when you pass in their area,no need to be a big shot).
6. You can't even murder NPCs in quests. Would be nice to see at least that you screwed up a quest and now everything goes to hell. any responses to your actions from the game apart from teleporting police would be nice actually.
7. A lot of quests need to be done in a specific order of steps, if you want to be clever and find another way to handle a situation in a way that was not expected or if you go too fast and skip some dialogue, the quest progression simply freezes and you have to reload.
8. Basicly, the game does not allow any roleplaying at all. Everything is fixed apart from the last mission and a few options to change the ending.


And that's without going into how most of the gameplay feels OK at best, melee is shitty, driving is horrible and the AI in game is dumb as hell.

If you want an RPG go play a Bethesda or a Bioware game, if you just want about 40 to 50 hours of gameplay with barely any point in doing a second playthrough and a decent story then go ahead and buy this game."
1609969013,great game. Shit tons of bugs but still fun. Requires a beefy PC or modern one.
1609969013,It good
1609968959,I had a lot of fun with Cyberpunk 2077 and look forward to playing it when the game is finished.
1609968702,"Awesome game, don't get all the hate. Yeah there are a few bugs here and there, mostly visual, but nothing that would break the experience for you. I am having a blast, one of the best games I have played this year. Get it and enjoy it"
1609968622,love this game
1609968619,"Has strong character development, good script, and superb models and world, and provides the experience of a future dominated by augmentations and AI. With bugs being patched, hopefully fast, and locations becoming more interactive, what the devs created here is simply amazing."
1609968575,s'good
1609968571,"TL;DR: Get the game! It is a wonderful experience that offers tons to do and rewards and punishes the player for their decisions in an intriguing way. 

I wasn't a part of the hype train for Cyberpunk 2077. The news I got about this game came through my friends and even then I partially paid attention to it. My curiosity for the game peak after it was released and everyone was complaining about it. 

Personally, I found the game to be a wonderful experience. There were a few bugs here and there, but they allowed to me enjoy the game because of random hi-jinks like cars jumping in the air when they are rendered in. But what kept me playing the game was the story, the choices you made and the characters you met. I enjoyed that my decisions in the skill tree effected the environment in different way! I choice to focus on the body tree and the game felt awesome when I literally could pry doors open. It sucked when I couldn't hack things because my technical ability was low, but that was by my own choices. 

The game really made me feel that my decisions matter and they impacted my gameplay. I had a very specific version of V when I started to play the game, but after completing the game, I felt the decisions were muddied and it was hard to determine what was right for me, or the V I wanted them to be. 

I found the story to be very interesting and some of the side quests to be really unique and added flare. As for the characters: any character of value to the player was unique, otherwise they got lost in the repetition of procedural-generated background characters. I do have a few issues with some of the character's backstory and felt they were either hokey, or were a generic carbon copy from other stories we have either seen, read or heard of before. 

That is my personal opinion and I will not spoil anything. Play the game yourself, and come to your own conclusions, but I found Cyberpunk 2077 to be a terrific game, bugs and all!"
1609968390,Amazing game released way too early.
1609968288,"Cyberpunk is masterpiece.
The story of this game is perfect, gameplay is very interesting. You can choose your own way to play this game. Obviously, there are a lot of bugs and there is very bad optimization (if you don't have 3090, it will be hurt your eye) but the story  compensates every mistake. I want to return in this game again and again because Night sity can't let me go.
So my score is 9/10. 
Thank you CDPR for cool story."

1609967874,Awesome game!
1609967816,As the game is i would not recommend this game maybe in a year or so of polishing but not in its current state.
1609967746,"This game had so much potential, I can feel the amount of work put in to create the Night City. Just, CDPR, it is not OK to lie about all those features that will never appear in the game."
1609967517,Great fun amazing game encountered barely any bugs.
1609967423,"For me this is a great RPG. Sure there are some bugs, but at least for me they've never been to distracting or game breaking, mostly just chuckle worthy. The combat and level up are great, so far the story is quiet good, the driving could be better tho, but it's not terrible. I know this is a positive review, but I'm hesitant to recommend it due to all the complaints I've heard, but I will, the game is great and I feel like it was just a bit overhyped."
1609967195,"Do not listen to the neasayers, this good game and very apt when taking present day politics into acount."
1609967154,"decent game, had a few graphical bugs and minor glitches. all in all 7/10"
1609967094,"I'm an idiot, and I approve of this game"
1609966732,crashes but runs well with high end hardware
1609966716,"Really good game, good game.
good."
1609966645,Amazing story along with the game. Game could be a great if it didn't struggle with some of the bugs.
1609966596,"   Overrated and/or Overhyped, 7/10 at best. Terribly Balanced Combat because I'm wiping out boss enemies with a few pistol rounds to the head while also needing to empty an entire assault rifle mag into the face of a basic grunt. I also find if difficult to target enemies when the blaring neons lights that make up most of the screen cancel out that tiny little dot in your scope sights. I think the melee combat is decent enough but needs a few tweaks here and there.
   There is a surprising lack of customization everyone expected with this game when it comes to vehicles and weapons and even you're own character (you're telling me people in this universe can get biological sex changes and cybernetic implants but i cant get a hair cut?). When it comes to weapons you can't get different color scemes and your modding options are only limited to sights, muzzles, and 1 or more cybernetic mods. Of course the game forces you to change weapons every few hours so making your own personaly customized weapon probably wouldn't be worth it anyway. Now vehicles...I haven't purchased a single one in the game, the game provides you with a few freebies that all work well enough and like i said before, No Customization for Vehicles as far as I've seen. When it comes to customizing your character, you do it at the start of the game and theres no going back. No hair cuts, no cybernetic changes, no sex change, despite those options being available to NPCs in the world. All you can do is change your characters clothes and skills. Bah. 
   Most multi choice dialogue options are pointless leading you down the exact same linear path the devs had in mind. Glitches are responsible for half my deaths. Stuff keeps spawning in and out of existence and its really immersion breaking. I have no doubt they'll greatly improve on the game in the future but yeah, its not 10/10 and i doubt it will ever be."
1609966198,AMAZING STORY THAT QUESTIONS THE MEANING OF HUMANITY AND CONSCIOUSNESS AMALGAMATING WITH TECHNOLOGY BUT ALSO THE ARCHITECT TOOK A SHIT NOW THE GAME HAS BUGS I AM SAD :(
1609966145,Just what the ripperdoc ordered.
1609965942,Needs more time
1609965839,"If this was made by any other studio after this buggy launch, I would write a negative review. It is however made by CDPR, and they have proved themselves to me and many other games with their past releases, tons of free content and dedication to make the game as good as it can be. They keep high standard and while a bit buggy, I believe this title to be like a phoenix, rising from the ashes.
It was a buggy game, I have completed it 100% (every single collectible, all quests and points of interest and so on). I have encountered some bugs but this was hell of a ride. Emotional, beautiful and really keeping me interested and that says a lot as I like sci-fi and fantasy genre but steampunk and cyberpunk are my least favorites. This title keeping me in my seat for days to want to explore more and more tells a lot about how good game it is.
Didn't write this review at once, wrote it instead a few days after finishing the core game to cool down. I am still amazed and look forward how CDPR will grow this project, it deserves all the love it can get."
1609965689,disgusting
1609965676,Hype!
1609965665,This game killed my 2080 super and asked for seconds
1609965459,"Ignoring all the political BS and minor bugs, the game is fun. and that should be all that matters."
1609965299,"Amazing game under a coat of many small, but at times annoying bugs. If you can wait to play the game, maybe wait half a year or so until the major issues are fixed.
The game is perfect if you're into really immersing yourself into a game, the level design is outstanding, I got attached to the characters and it's just fun to roam through Night City.
Also the soundtrack bangs and this game has one of the best endings I've ever seen.
Would definitely recommend"
1609964898,"Its a good game, great stories and all. 
I didnt have any mayor bugs as in crashes, but the unpolishedness of this endproduct is a trend we have to stop supporting. 
i was unable to do 2 quests, and some stuff at the end of the game i wont spoil. 

GREAT GAME BUT BUY IN 6 MONTHS, POLISHED AND WITH A DISCOUNT."
1609964811,"good game, very buggy and unfinished"
1609964679,"I`ve said yes.. but, yes there is a but, the feeling I have that this a good game, with a great game hoping to escape. The look of it is amazing, though if you have a not so powerful machine, it probably won`t be. I have a Geforce GTX 1080Ti Sc2 graphics card, and a 27"" screen, but I cannot play this at 4K. I can however drop down a scale, and play everything on Ultra and it`s fine. Some of the story line telling is excellent, and I know there will be some of you will want to skip the cut scenes, but don`t, as these are integral to the story, they expand the game into an experience, if you leave them out, you`ll become frustrated. The reason being is a lot of the mechanics of the game itself, are a little wanting, probably because it feels unfinished. There is some examples of really bad clipping, characters embedded in walls, hovering above steps, lighting effects that disappear, whole streets of people completely disappearing when you bump into someone, weapons feeling vague, driving a bit woolly, yet I`m recommending it wholeheartedly, as an SF fan it ticks all the boxes, there may be aspects which look incredibly dated, the inventory system looks virtually no different to the original Deus Ex from 20 years ago, but I think CD Project Red know they may have made a bit of a dogs dinner at launch, so I believe it`s in there own interest to improve the game over time. Should you pay full price, not sure, this was a gift given, so I did, but those not sure, wait until there`s a few quid off, until some of the mechanics and effects of the game have been improved, and it will be. The story is epic, the game could be, even with all it`s faults at the moment.  Not quite full marks, but 8 out of 10 is my mark."
1609964636,Love it!!

1609964288,"Don't let a few small bugs deter  you, this game is amazing.  The overall production quality is through the roof.  The music, story, scale, dialog and many other things put this game over the top."
1609964055,It fun
1609964012,Very Good. Great Graphics. Minimum experience with bugs. No game breaking bugs only visual ones.
1609963758,"buggy as fuck

alot of game problems

story way too short

side missions a little too limited

but for its genre its a decent game. If you like Tom Clancy Ghost Recon Wildland, you will probably like this game too"
1609963684,"In spite of the bugs and the hate, i really enjoyed this game. Storyline is what's most gripping, and what made the 100 hours i played worth it."
1609963662,"Wow, 130 hours later finally completed this game! 130 hours of main story, side quests, NCPD hustles, buying cars, chopping heads and slapping gonks. Breathtaking !

Pros
1) Fabulous story
2) Beautiful world
3) Amazing voice acting
4) Significant characters and story telling
5) Good levelling system, cyber ware, weapons, mods, crafting to keep you going for days.

Cons
I'll leave the complaining to the ones on Console :)"
1609969408,"This is simply the best game I have ever played

First I have to say, this game has the best technical graphics and graphics in general, combined with the biggest scale I have ever seen in a game period. The fact that Digiralfoundry was blown away and made Cyberpunk 2077 their best looking game should tell you something if you don't take my word for it. Now I see why developers wanted us to experience this game in first person and not third person. Like I said the graphics combined with this MASSIVE world, on a massive scale is absolutely insane. Never seen anything like it.

Then there is the story and the charecters which comes on top. I could go on and on why this game is so amazing. This is the only game that captures the perfect look and atmosphere from sci fi movies like blade runner, and other sci fi movies from the 80'es and 90'es and such

I has very good and deep mechanics when it comes to perk unlocking, leveling up, and crafting.

I can go on and on why this game is so awesome, but this game has to be experienced by the individual as the masterpiece it is. Does it have bugs, sure, but nothing critical in my experience/opinion. Im sure the bugs will be fixed soon, ofcourse they will."
1609963577,Rocky start but a masterpiece  nonetheless. I'm sure a few patches and polish is enough to make it the best damned game of 2020.
1609963558,YOU CANT MASSACRE CHILDREN
1609963540,"Unpolished, unoptimised rubbish,"
1609963527,"After over 40 hours of play time, I really don't know how to feel about this game. The story is great, you've got plenty of things to do, many different possible play styles all packed into a decently sized open world(cool!). But that's where the good stuff ends (at least for me).

  For some reason my 3 year old gaming rig just can't seem to get good frame rates on decent settings with this game. I'm currently running a ryzen 5 2600x with a vega 56 and 32gb of ram, it's by no means the quickest machine by today's standards... But it still meets or exceeds the recommended specs. That being said... The graphics aren't great, the NPC's are completely soulless, and the driving sucks, and it's buggy (who would have guessed?!).   

If you don't mind paying full price for what feels like an incomplete game and have the hardware to get the most out of it, all the power to you. For those of you running older machines, I'd hold off a little until they get this game running properly.

On that note - it didn't cure my herpes like people said it would, but I still enjoyed it enough to play it for 40+ hours so that's something.
"
1609963480,"Despite me enjoying the game quite a bit, the amount of bugs, glitches and downright missing content while you can definitely tell that it was supposed to be there is. Damn shareholders shot knowingly shot themselves in the foot so they can complain about it and make the tensions in the dev team even worse...a real shame.

I dont even think that the patches will make up for it"
1609963463,"First of all, in my 40 hours of playtime I had not a single gamebreaking bug, only minor ones like glitchy animations, bad vehicle collision, or textures that load too slowly here and there. Annoying maybe, but nothing that would be even close to make me stop playing the game.
People talk on one hand a lot about missing features, bugs, unfinished gameplay. 
And on the other hand they talk about the amazing open world, the gameplay, the variety of items, and so on.
But in my opinion, where the game really shines, is the quests and the characters.

If you approach Cyberpunk, thinking it's a futuristic GTA, then that's the wrong mindset!

Cyberpunk is NOT a sandbox. It is a story-driven open-world game with RPG elements but the main focus are the characters and the quests.
I can honestely say that I never played a game where I got so immersed and I never played a game where I felt so depressed and lonely when it was over. If you cry when you see the credits screen then that's not a shame and judging from comments on the internet, it is definitely not uncommon!

I find it hard to put into words why this game means so much to me but but I can certainly say that it touched me on an emotional level. The absolutely amazing music, the believable characters, the quests (even the sidequests), the dialogues, the choices, the whole presentation. All these elements together made me feel immersed and emotional for the characters and the story  like no other game before. 

I don't expect everyone to feel the same for this game as I do. But if you play it with the right mindset, if you don't approach it as a sandbox-game, but as a story-driven one, if you accept it for what it is, then you might have the best and most emotional gaming experience of your life.

I definitely did."
1609963384,If you have a solid 2020/21 PC that can handle this game I highly recommend it. Most of the negativity surrounding this game is from last gen consoles which can't run the game well... Tbh they probably shouldn't have released it on last gen consoles.  Works well on a solid gaming PC and is highly engaging! 9 of 10
1609963323,Game crashes all the time and has a million bugs but I'd still recommend it if you're a fan of in-depth RPGs or the cyberpunk theme in general
1609963287,"Cyberpunk is a ""Triple A"" title released in 2020. What does that mean... Well it is not finished; graphical glitches, poor optimization, bugs. That being said the story is great. The characters are great. The world is great. If you want to look at this game as an investment you would not be wrong. But if you prefer to wait for it to be actually finished that is highly recommended. If you purchase it now you will find things to truly enjoy and things that will truly annoy."
1609963235,v me in tha ass
1609963235,"Story and main campaign 8.5/10

open world 2/10

visuals/graphics 9/10

Gameplay 5/10

I give this game a very generous 7/10 overall. the world is beautiful, the game is fun with tons of options. Other than combat AI i dont think Ai exist in this game. Traffic and races are all laid out on tracks. there are no cop cars, no vehicles chases. no NPC AI at all they all just walk in giant circles seemingly. its really the least immersive open world game iv played. There are certain perks that seem compeletly useless like they were going somewhere with them but then couldnt finish and just forgot to cut them from the game. there is a lot of cool clothes and weapons but you often get pigeon holed into using whatever is best, no matter how stupid it looks.

BUT the game is really fun, if you can put on your blinders in between missions and just focus on story and missions its a lot of fun. part of me wants to stop playing and wait for updates for apparent missing features, part of me thinks they probly wont come. Part of me hopes the modding community will fill in them missing gaps. I would hate to beat them game and be done with it only for it to massively improve a year from now.

If they can add basic NPC AI, basic traffic AI and police cars, i will absolutely recommend this game. Until then i dont think i can.
"
1609962885,"Despite the bugs and the performance issues, this game has really well written, charismatic characters and a great story!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1609962852,"Lots of bugs at release, some of which are infuriating, but it is still one hell of a game. Can't stop playing once I get started. If the bugs get sorted, this will be one of my favorite games I've ever played. (been gaming since 1995)."
1609962847,you can slap people with a vibrating dildo
1609962804,"After finishing the main story I can say, that this game has a good story, epic ending and nice sex choices :) 
After all I will give this a 8/10 for its bugs and poor optimalization"
1609962710,"Its ok, guns are shit, be a katana ninja man and you won't regret, that or pick up a lead pipe and brain some bitches cause bullets dont work. EXCEPT OVERWATCH PUT UR ELECTROWIZWHEEL IN MISS PALMER AND TAKE HER BIG MASSIVE WEAPON"
1609962666,"El juego es una maldita joya, en ocasiones siento que algunas misiones secundarias son mejores que la principal pero luego pienso lo contrario, una montaña rusa de emociones, un parque de juego inmenso y miles de historias que Night City cuenta, pedazo de joya de videojuego, el que diga lo contrario es una perra de la prensa."
1609962592,CDPR dooped everyone
1609962517,"Game runs fine for me, barely any noticeable glitches so far."
1609962361,"idk what to say i really wanted to like it but i just get bored. 

Main story is great no doubt about it but this game is not an open world city that I was advertised. The side quests are the exact same thing over and over.  Go kill a bandit camp again, and again, and again, no meaningful backstory just get a call from a fixer saying they got a job for you, no meaningful interactions or choices really much of anything side quest . After you kill 50 bandit camps you can afford 1 pcs of cyberware (side note the cyberware is not game changing all it does it give you extra health/armor/ stamina) The coolest cyberware i got was the double jump legs) The city looks huge but the playable areas are actually really small. Almost every building has no content and the doors are ""locked"". The game is not really open world there is pretty much shops and side quests (bandit camp) then main story. The city is not alive at all in opinion. I would wait till they add more content to this, its no where near a full game."
1609962292,"Got 100+ hours after finishing just one ending. Intend to play each ending, and the 2 other lifepaths. I am pleased and satisfied with this game but like everyone else i was expecting a bit more details in this open world gameplay. Story is very good, but cars and people are robots, you get killed in one or two hits, and tghe AI is dumb. Also the people on the street are a bit lifeless they always shout at you before they talk normal to you. Buggy as hell haha. but worth the money and the wait. Hope the DLC's are as good as in the Witcher 3."
1610054652,"Don't let the mob mentality fool you. Yeah, there's bugs, nothing game breaking foir me. This game has many good parts. Its reminiscent of Watch Dogs, RAGE 2, GTA, Borderlands, Fallout and Deus EX put into one game. There's an insane amount of content. 8/10 at the moment. It will get even better with bug fixes and performance enhancements."
1609962492,"There is a lot wrong with the game , there are a lot of bugs and glitches and people have vastly different experiences. 
i was one of the lucky ones i have had mostly graphical bugs and about 3 game braking ones in my 150hrs or so. 

That been said i cant say its a bad game. When its all going good ( and that is most of the time ) its very good and for sure one of my favourites. I dont regret buying it at all and i highly look forward to DLC and other add-ons to the game. My advice is you buy it knowing its buggy and yeah there is a lot they said that is not in the game , A lot of peoples criticisms are valid. I hope bugs are worked out in patches and they fix and add things. But honestly dont let it put you off i say.

 My advice is go in blind. The less you know the better it is over all. Play the game once just by your self explore and do things all on your own and move at your own speed. It is better you dont rush the main story and take your time ( if you ask me )and avoid online information, spoilers and walkthroughs and really look about the city, read the info cards you collect as well as if you find a open PC the messages inside it if any. 

The story and side quests are good the Characters you interact with are believable and well done 
There are only a few romance choices and once you enter a ship with them they will just become a NPC and have little impact on things after that. Maybe in the future you can do more with them but for now that is it, but still worth it and believable its not ""and one day they love you"", there is a believable advancement and reason to it all. 

Sounds are very good, a lot of the music was well thought out and you dont get annoyed with the music. As well as the ads and tv are all cleaver. Not a lot of content but sitting down and watching the tv or the adds around NC are nice. Guns and combat all sound good and work fairly well. Melee has issues but once you get the mechanics down it is is fine and in some moments i favour it over shooting, i dont think its a waste to have points in hand to hand is what i am saying. 

I am still playing the game and using what i know now to improve my character and i am liking my 2nd playthrough seeing things i missed the first time and all that. Surprisingly a lot. So for me it has replay value.  

 here are some of my opinions and take them at face value. 
- Female V is better [ the voice actress nails it , streetkid as well feels to fit NC and the voice better ] ( Male fits nomad better but still, ) Male voice is fine and does a good job some parts he feels better in but over Cherami Leigh preem choice ;)
- Upgrades. Gear is just gear in this what you have on helps but is not crazy important. I say find a look and set of weapons you like and upgrade them and keep an eye out for next tier versions of them to add enhancements too 
- Bikes over Cars. The cars you  get and can buy are good and fun but the bikes are FAR more useful.  

Enjoy Night City  i did and still do."
1609961953,is very nice
1609961874,bruh
1609961706,is good
1609961669,"very buggy and hard to play but worth the struggle for sure
"
1609961636,Just save alot.
1609961631,"Amazing Game with an Amazing story arc. CDPR outdid themselves with the amount of paths there are to take, nearly 200 hours in, starting my third playthrough, now as corpo scum. Good Morning Night City!"
1609961610,this game is an utter mess. I'm tired of all the glitches. the developers are not doing enough to fix it.
1609961420,it sucks
1609961365,"Man Cyberpunk 2077, what an experience. After 200 hours in the game I can say with certainty it was a fun experience that even now I still want to continue. For all of its shortcomings I still thoroughly enjoyed both of my playthroughs. That being said the game comes with loading issues, audio mixing bugs, but for me no game breaking bugs. From playing it, it feels clear that rushed development, executive interference, and over reliance on Keanu are the roots of the game's shortcoming. Not to say his performance was bad, he nailed his performance. The character however... is a mixed bag. The other side characters and side stories were great in my opinion, but they all come to what feels like a grinding halt at their conclusion. They all desperately need more after conclusion content as I see it. That being said the side gigs, not to be confused with side quests, for the most part all come down to ""Go into small or medium building, grab/destroy thing/person, leave"". Personally I would have appreciated more actual heists with prep and execution. The side character stories sometimes get close to that but ultimately never quite deliver that experience. But even with that I can't say I didn't enjoy them, there's enough variation in them that they do manage to change things up a little. It shows that given more time they all likely could have been fleshed out a little more. 
However the main story really does fall flat in my opinion. It just doesn't have the same quality and development that the side quest lines have. That may come down to the fact that the main plot device pushes a sense of urgency. Instead of a journey its more like bum rush to the end. The short main story is a known issue but man it really suffers from it. 
Ultimately for all of its problems I still had a load of fun, the more time I spent with it the more it became obvious that the devs put a lot of passion into what they could deliver in the time they were given. For all its faults its still a good game that I had a lot of fun with. But the issues it does have remind you that this really could have been a great game"
1609961186,Underneath all the technical issues and such there is a great game solid 8/10 besides the bugs nothing next gen as promised but still a damn good game.
1609961091,"Finished most of the stuff in the game.
Main quests and side gigs are good and the world looks nice.

But that's about it, bugs/glitches/performance issues aside, the game is mediocre.
The open world is boring with nothing to do execpt following quest markers, no interactivity whatsoever. The A.I is a complete joke and the RPG-elements are severely lacking, I mean even basic things like changing your characters hair is not possible after the initial character creation and don't even get me started on the non existent car customization and the shallow weapon customization (can't change the color of your guns for example)."
1609961004,"After completing my first run slashing through with the katana, made me wonder who really is the cyberpsycho, 9/10."
1609960970,Crashed 3 times on final mission AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
1609960926,"[b]Would you rather live in peace as Mr. Nobody... or go down for all times in a blaze of glory?[/b]
This game takes over me like Johnny Silverhand."
1609960756,"Does it have its problems and glitches yes. do they subtract from the game sometimes? also yes.
Is it probably one of the best games i have played in some time? oh my god yes. the story they have crafted and the pure ambition is absolutely staggering! 5/7 would play again and again and again"
1609960687,I like it
1609960632,I spent over a hundred hours in this game and then my in-game lesbian girlfriend broke up with me. 10/10.
1609960582,11/10. Would bang Panam in a hover tank again.
1609960571,"The story is amazing, it gave me chills in some parts, few bugs and glitches that i bealive, and hope, that can be fixed. Overall, and amazing game."
1609960533,10/10
1609960511,"It needs a ton of work, its not anywhere near what we thought it was going to be.
That having been said there is a real beating heart of something special here. 

You'll be playing the early beta version of a game that will someday be amazing , or a sad reminder of how awesome it could have been given a little more time. For now it is worth the money if you have a machine that is able to run it . 

The characters, voice acting and music are amazing, and visuals are really something that you can call next gen in 2020. 

I really hope they keep working to make this game better and better over the next couple of years, it could be a true classic one day if they want it to be."
1609960307,It is something new for me but I really enjoy it.
1609960123,Promised the next generation open world RPG. Delivered half finished garbage not up to last generation standards.
1609959935,"Awesome game, but at the moment it keeps crashing. Maybe wait to purchase once its more reliable."
1609959915,"I recommend this game if you're a big RPG fan and have a pretty beefy computer. The rpg mechanics in this game are super fun and have good depth, and the story and characters are very engaging. There's definitely no shortage of bugs, but for the most part they are minor and don't affect gameplay. I'd also recommend to load this game onto an SSD rather than a hard drive, as you will experience a decent amount of ""pop in"" with models while using a hard drive (though much less than the amount experienced on release)."
1609959845,"The graphics are nice looking, but haven't been very happy with the game play.  The story is boring and feels like a story I've heard before with no originality to it.  Coming from the previous Witcher games this game doesn't even hold a candle to that story.  Expectations after they showed the demo of this game along with all the other information about the game we were told by CDPR made this a huge disappointment.  When you say you are going to create this immersive open world experience with all these things that haven't done in a game and then not to have those in the game at launch was sucks.  I've already beat the game,and don't plan to go back and play it.  If you want to try it out I'd recommend waiting for patches and a steam sale."
1609959792,"This is not an RPG, choices dont matter. The city, the story, the characters are all hollow and lifeless. All style no substance. Crafting and skills are pointless and unoriginal. Side quests all repetitive. Main story too short, simple, boring. This is a joke of a game. Sorry. The city looks nice though."
1609959737,This game is breathtaking :D
1609959719,"Good game, def not the game of the year title, i would wait a couple years when they put it on sale and all the dlc is out instead of paying for buggy mess of a game."
1609959707,It's fun.
1609959585,"i love this game, some bug is no problemm. good luck CD project"
1609959423,"I played through the story, hate to say that it there is not much to remember. The story was hard to follow with un-interesting dialouge.

After the brief story there wasn't much to do that made me keep playing. Also the story was quite short, however there are a bunch of side-mission to play which I have not played through all of them. 
So all this is just my own experience.

There are choices you can make with different outcomes so the story may be worth playing again. If there was a Mixed option I'd use it, but I have to go with Recommended because the game is still worth playing in my opinion."
1609959219,"For all time I play in cyberpunk, I've only met 15 bugs, and have 5 broken quests.

also game have poor drawing of textures, that prevents you from sometimes enjoying the game even on ultra settings. there's also no new game +


BUT if you can enjoy story and dialogs, immerse yourself in the passage and networking, then and only then you can play this game and even don't see bugs and glitch.

Pros:
- Amazing story (even if u don't have choice, what u want to do because u always do what game want from you)
- Good cybernetic customization
- Awesome city, design and atmosphere

Cons:
- A lot of bugs and glitches 
- bad car physics (even mods can't help)
- mini map suck (you will always miss turns and go crash into passers-by because it is very difficult to even enter the turn)
- Like I say before no choice, form rpg left only crafting and  level up




I recommend buy this game if u really like cyberpunk world and really like something like deus ex."
1609958785,"Buggy glitchy mess that won't even run properly on a pc with a 7700k and GTX 1080 w/ 24gb of RAM

Gunplay feels sloppy and lacks fluidity of other shooters (rainbow six siege, call of duty, etc.)
Story wasn't super engaging within the first 1 hour, but that doesn't mean it isn't good - the game just didn't run well enough on my PC for me to want to get that far. Will probably buy the game again if it goes on sale for < $30"
1609958734,"this shit is gas, i wish they would have finished it before they released it"
1609958610,"At the time of this posting it is a good game, specially because of the story behind it. Nothing else really shines. Still, I don't regret getting this game early."
1609958466,"Awesome, i'm absolutely blown away by this game and its performance. Looks great, even on the not so high settings."
1609958421,"Flawed, very bare bones rpg with mostly an illusion of choice, decent combat, and a development that showed so much but came out with many features shown stripped out. Weird NPC path driving, buggy overall, and rushed parts of the map.

Still would play it anyday. It's fun, and it was worth the money. Twice."
1609958348,"This burning pile of shit has got to be one of the worst investments I have ever made, I feel ashamed that I’ve so easily allowed myself to get robbed off of 80$. There isn’t a penny’s worth in this garbage, save your money or buy toilet paper, it will serve you better.

Absolute trash, lies and half assed burning shit. 

This isn’t anything it promised to be, forget about it and never come back."
1609958307,"I recommend this game in a year.  Maybe 6 months from now, if the studio can get together, and finish the game.   It is fun to play, but has no Re-playability after a couple of runs through, and the open world isnt anywhere near finished, nor is it interesting after you have beat up the different faction and can wipe out everything on Hard mode with no effort.  IE after about 10 hours of play.  The super hard secret end mission, isnt hard at all.  The cut scenes are miserable wastes of time, and the game wont let you skip them.  And yet I still give it a thumbs up because there isnt anything else out there right now worth a shit."
1609958297,"[H1]Wake-up Samurai! You have to re-load your last save...![/h1]

I'll give you my honest opinion having played the game for almost 100 hours and the rest is up to you with what you do with that information!

        [th]Review Points:[/th]
        [th]My Opinion:[/th]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Worth the price tag?[/td]
        [td]Currently priced at £49.99 (and I bought the game at full price), I would say there is more than enough content to keep you busy for at least 120hrs if you wish to be a full completionist - however the main storyline will take you in the region of 20/30hrs depending on your play style. [/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Graphics?[/td]
        [td]Phenomenal... If you have ray-tracing compatibility on your graphic's card and you're able to ramp the graphics up to ultra (or even psycho setting) then you're in for a real treat. One of the best looking games I've ever played and I had the privilege of playing the game in ultra graphics with a good frame-rate. You will soon find yourself taking screenshots as you play, the game is extremely photogenic. [/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Gameplay?[/td]
        [td]It's difficult to accurately review the gameplay mechanics to get across my opinion, so I'll break it down into three categories for simplicity; shooting aspect of the game feels relatively smooth and well optimised, but nowhere near perfect. The melee combat is very janky however (I would avoid using melee as your main fighting trait at all costs) and requires some work and the driving feels just like GTA., you can feel they've polished the driving mechanics and vehicles pretty well.

The actual gameplay itself is amazing - the main story arc is gripping, not too complicated to understand and has you on the edge of your seat at times. Very well written and you come to adore some of the characters you meet. Even some of the side-missions feel like storyline missions as-well, so it's nice to get more lore and more story content. 

I would say they've added A LOT of filler missions though (in the form of the NCPD missions) and most of them feel rather pointless, they're just there to keep you playing long after you've completed the main story arc and you'll find the game becomes bit of a grind. 

There are also a lot of exploits/bugs within the game too... Sorry, but we can't ignore that the game is broken in parts. I've had my fair share of game breaking glitches, whether that be I'm suddenly unable to shoot my weapon, a quest bugs out or something in general just breaks... Otherwise, you'll notice plenty of graphical glitches in parts; floating cars, T-posing NPCs or profile/UI glitches - but otherwise, you adapt and get on with it. [/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [th]Overall opinion?[/th]
        [th] On the whole though, PC have the best and most stable version of the game right now and despite the bugs/glitches, I've only been forced to fail two side-missions (I literally cannot complete them due to the missions being completely broken).

I would HIGHLY recommend this game despite it's current state. Wow, what a roller-coaster I had! It's well worth the money for the main storyline you experience and you truly do feel the atmosphere of Night City. They've done a remarkable job, but you also notice the corners they've had to cut in places - which is sad, very sad to say the least. But! The developers have vowed to fix the game with future updates and considering they fixed The Witcher series, I have high hopes they'll polish this game to it's full potential. 

Play it. Enjoy it. Ignore the silly bugs. 
If you're on Steam, then you have the pleasure of playing the PC version.

[i]Please remember that this review is based upon my own opinion having played the game for a length of time to develop a constructive piece of feedback. This review may change at a later date should the game be updated/patched significantly to change any of the above mentioned topics I've mentioned.[/i]"
1609958281,"Unfortunately there's too many bugs that derail the immersion. Highly poignant scenes are sharply interrupted by vehicles getting yeeted into orbit...Comical NPC animations...NCPD appearing out of the ether when you get in trouble...and so on...
"
1609958095,"Despite all the glitches, it's still a lot of fun. If you liked The Witcher 3 you'll definitely enjoy this. Just make sure your PC can handle it."
1609957818,"It's not a bug, it's a feature, stop complaining. 

Nah but for real it's a great game."
1609957747,Good Game
1609957458,bugfest ...
1609957409,"story gud


bug bad


but story better"
1609957349,Great game. The glitchs add to it's character.
1609957438,"Does the game have so many bugs that you just learn to live with them after a while? Yes.
Is it clear that some corners where cut and that you can't even change your hair after initial character selection? Yes.
Does it have many irrelevant side quests and make it hard to find the good and relevant ones? Yes.

Are there some quests that are really good, explore interesting thoughts and ideas and that make you sympathize with characters? Absolutely.
Is the writing and performance of characters and story make the initial difficulties worth it? An outstanding yes

The game definitely has it's flaws, but inbetween all the clunkiness it is a good game with good writing, decent combat with a lot of customization, lovable side characters and a very decent main story. I would go as far to say that the proper side quests and content are the real heroes of the game while the main story complements it nicely. If I would compare it to The Witcher 3 I would say that it's not quite there yet, but with the coming updates and DLC I would definitely say it has a chance of becoming a quite amazing game."
1609957064,"All in all I'm happy with the game, I currently have 30 hours game time but at least half of that has been spent doing side quests or just driving around taking in Night City and the Badlands. I feel like I'm only 25%-30% through the main story. This game is truly massive. 

The good stuff: Night City is incredible and the immersion is pretty good. The massive metropolis can be a little but overwhelming but the main story missions are structured quite well to drip-feed and introduce you to parts of the city district by district. Gun fights are really fluid and fun, there's a little work involved in spec-ing but it's not too bad and you're not really punished for skipping crafting and just buy/find the highest stat equipment, Also the conversations between characters are amazing and so immersive. When just driving around the city I find myself actually calling them up just to hear some extra dialogue.  

Bad stuff: I fee this game was touted by CD Projeckt to be a lot of things it's not. It was mentioned that there would be many different ways to complete the same mission, but their take on this appears to be more like ""you can go in guns blazing or be stealthy"" which is nothing new at all. I would say Deus Ex: Human Revolution (ironically a game released over a decade ago which also features cyber-enhanced humans in the near future) actually did that better. Spec your strength to  break down a wall, enhance your lungs to crawl through a poisonous vent, or install mind pheromones to charm the guard and walk in through the front door, or just buy a really big gun and shoot your way in. THOSE were the multiple open ended options to complete levels in Deus Ex and it was amazing. 2077 it's pretty much ""want to skip 40% of the level? Spec strength to tear down this locked door. Otherwise take the long way round"". It's more like people who have chosen certain builds will find some levels easier and some harder, but ultimately you still have to follow ""the path"", it's definitely an illusion of choice.

It's definitely not a bad game, I've enjoyed it to date, I feel I still have at least another 40-50 hours before I complete the main story and the replay value is there. But this game has nothing new and is not ground breaking. Don't believe the hype. Keep your expectations neutral and you'll be happy with your purchase. Solid 8/10 - Game-play is unoriginal but it's carried by it's amazing story telling and world building."
1609957059,Hack and Burn.
1609956937,"If i could change one thing about this game that improve the overall experience is 
SAVE SCUMMING.

nobody like save scumming, but in Cyberpunk you need to save scum to get the best in slot gear.
after beat the game 3 times.. it destroy my immersion experience.. before picking up a legendary loot.. i spent 30minutes save scumming till its acceptable gear.. 
Please Cyberpunk, design the game so we dont have to suffer save scumming."
1609956908,"Overall this game is excellent. Yes there are bugs, we all know this, and it sucks big time in that respect. I've been playing it on a relatively budget gaming pc and I got my little brother the PS4 copy for Christmas. He has a PS4 Slim, and lets just say he hasn't played anything but this since Christmas lol. I guess people had their expectations set WAY TOO HIGH. Idk if they thought this was going to be a full on simulation with every little detail you could imagine or what, but I think its a well made game. I hope they include all the massive parts/features of the game that had to be removed with the upcoming updates. I have read some posts from devs at CD Projekt Red that describe a much better game which was cut down at the last second by the big wigs. Anyhoo, it's a sick game and it's only going to continue to get better from here. Buy it!!"
1609959353,Keanu Reeves go brrrrrrrrrr
1609956880,"Pretty good, if a bit buggy."
1609956845,edr
1609956825,"Absolutely stunning game, I played for hours and was totally immersed"
1609956803,"So, currently playing through the second story line of Corpo. Previous was Street Kid. 
Honestly, if the game would fix the performance glitches and stuff, it would be a ten outta ten for, or maybe my hardware is not up to the task, even though playing with an RTX 2070 super and Ryzen 5 2600 (changing soon to 7 3800X) with a ultra quality settings, none RTX and DLSS on auto. I have tweaked a bunch of settings and other things, but the best I am getting at right now with the hardware specs mentioned, at High with some sprinkles of Ultra is 60fps, but the lows would be around 30fps. And it depends on the city limits (like, if near your apartment and you drive faster than NPC cars, FPS is around 30, but in the Outer skirts of the city and less populated places its easy 60fps). 
Honestly, after so many experimenting with the game itself and the settings/guides and such, at this moment in time, im happy what I get and the game does not disappoint with story and side/gigs and other activities.  I would give this game a 7 since it is missing some like customization items, not from the RPG standpoint like skills and weapons, but customization of weapons/cars/yourself and the apartment. If that would be implemented in the game, I would go up to a solid 8 and a half. The point and half is lost due to simple mistakes, such as game performance issues (feels like a console game ported to PC platform in one week), there are bugs, but none are ""game breaking"" - they are just the dumbest bugs that are funny to experience. Also, a couple bonus points: you can get a cat as a deco for your apartment (Google it); The easter eggs are quite fun to experience in this game and most of all, I would say that the city itself (even the outskirts) are just filled with stuff to explore and people to listen to."
1609956734,"I played this game for 160+ hours so i guess i liked it. I have seen better  graphics on my modest PC and even the current Version (1.06 at time of writing) feels kinda unfinished and buggy. The driving (cars) is horrible with a XBox One Controller. The main story-path feels short and the RPG-Elements underwhelming (doesn't really matter what backstory you chose and what decisions you make). HOWEVER... i really liked the side-missions and the gunplay was suprisingly fun, The voice acting is nicely done and i liked most characters alot. Romancing was fun too (but the sex scenes were scary and probably scarred me for the rest of my life).
It's a big step down from Witcher and prolly doesn't deserve the 9/10 and 10/10 the media threw at it. 
I'd give it a 7-8/10 (Neither great nor bad, just fine)"
1609956932,"Quite frankly, a lot of the flack this game has received is unfair and prime examples of double standards. It's no more buggy than Skyrim was at release, and significantly less buggy than other games to come out this fall with better reviews despite that, such as Microsoft Flight Sim which was so buggy it couldn't even be installed for many and was unplayable for many others for quite some time, or Assassins Creed Valhalla which has many more game breaking bugs in less play time. Cyberpunk is a great game with great story. It certainly needs refinement which it will surely get in time, just like any other game. CDPR really couldn't win. Entitled gamers were going to pitch a fit whether they took the time to clean it up or released it when they did. Just buy it, enjoy it. If you are like me and played the original Cyberpunk 2020 table top and grew up reading William Gibson then you will find this sublime."
1609956558,so many great side missions that all tie in
1609956382,i know it's not great on all platforms but if you have the right equiptment to run it this is a spectacular game and i really hope people give it time to fix it's self and improve its self before writing it off!
1609956365,The fucking fight with Rhino is so fucked up. one hit you lose she can kick you cant. and the timing to do a counter has to be so perfect its bull shit. the fact that she was so far away from me and hit me is also bullshit. and on top of that the slow reaction from mouse to computer to game makes it almost impossible to beat her. about to stop playing the whole game because of this.
1609956345,"there are so many glitches and bugs that it’s as if it is an unfinished game 
i recommend not to buy this"
1609956098,"Buggy but great game, bugs will go away over time. Make plenty of saves in case you get stuck on a certain mission."
1609956096,"Yes, there are still plenty of bugs to deal with, but if you're patient and want a good solo game to kill some time  the story is great. loads of side missions to help you level yourself up and what feels like infinite possibility"
1609956001,The s3x scenes in this game was animated by the CEO of Special ED himself
1609955899,"This game will bring the best out of you, the graphics don't matter, it's the trip from the beginning to the end of the story that spoke to me and I loved every second I played this game, it was like a emotional roller coaster for the events that happen, the choices that you make feel so impacted on you that you start to think if you made the right choice."
1609955876,its ok
1609955273,"An unfulfilled promise upon the release...
A masterpiece in progress..



No, I'm not talking about the Mr. Stud, XCV/19 series."
1609955202,really good although there was some bugs. it was very good story line.
1609955085,"Problems and bugs appear once you reach the city. At that time the 2 hour window to refund is gone. 

This is an empty shell. Buggy. A world/city that does not feel alive. Crappy stealth."
1609955049,yes
1609955031,"Glitches and bugs aside, its an amazing game"
1609954989,"Una excelente historia de CP, soberbio ver la ciudad desde esta nueva perspectiva. 

Recomendado moverlo sólo con máquinas potentes, esto es el nuevo Crysis de la generación en lo que el apartado gráfico corresponde y afecta a todo."
1609954974,It just works
1609954873,besides the bugs great story
1609954790,"The first impression is incredible, the game is visually appealing, while the long anticipation makes you believe that now you will witness something completely new and astounding. Later you realize how unfinished it actually is. Even regardless of all the bugs, there is still not much to do, there is no customization of any kind, side quests are mostly all the same and when you realize how similar all the NPCs act - Night City becomes just a very decent interactive art book. The police is a separate thing in the game, they start shooting you after you accidentally hit a pedestrian, and instead of car chases they just spawn behind your back all the time. I couldn't imagine such things happening even in GTA Vice City. 
Even though I cannot say that the game is bad - I am still certain that after so many years of production and the hype they've created it could have been much better. Maybe after all the upcoming patches all the things will be fixed, but for me, it was not worth the pre-order, and at the moment it is not worth to be recommended as well."
1609954761,"some bugs here and there but the actual game is more fun than what i have had in any other game in a long time, i highly recommend."
1609954683,it all ended to fast. 10/10
1609954544,"In spite of it showing a few very minor bugs. It is still one of the best First Person RPGs i have played. Every character is very fleshed out. The graphics are beautifull and the world you play inn ""feels"" full of people."
1609954371,"I give this game a 7.5/10. The npcs kinda suck and there are a LOT of glitches. However it does do some good. I wouldn't buy it if you're looking for a cool open world role playing game. I would recommend for its combat and if you expect it to be triple a game, also its not worth that 60$. Tell me what i did wrong if you hate me and this bad review."
1609954153,amazing
1609954135,"Great game! All the hoopla around aside, moved more than Witcher 3. Great writing and acting. Only wish there were more permutations to the story and accreation of your decision making. Feels good after playing, just finished it a few moments ago!"
1609954078,Fun game
1609954051,"Where are the Daft Punk ?!!!
(By the way awesome game !)"
1609954036,"My review is actually a yes but actually no type of thing, the game itself is like any typical rpg game with billions of quests to do, but it's in the future and it's a game that needs a NASA Computer to run at, at least, 30 fps. I have actually an excellent computer and I'm blocked at 12 fps no matter if I put super high graphics or super low, might be broken, but still needs a nasa computer. The game is fun but you can't enjoy it to it's fullest at 12 fps, please optimize it and don't waste the 7 years you guys put in this to finally releasing it and it dies 2 weeks after official launch."
1609954073,Decent
1609953945,"Great story, although a bit short. This is compensated by the enourmous amount of side content. Glitches are plenty, but thats because I'm playing on a 4 year old mediocre pc with a 6th gen i5 and a RX480."
1609953793,"From as far as I've played the games fun. Plenty to keep you busy if your doing the side quest and events.
The graphics are nice even on lower settings but the game is VERY buggy. And requires a higher end set up to run well. If I never drove I could probably run the game on high, but the moment I hope into a car it gets laggy AF.
But outside driving the game is enjoyable.

1609953464,A great game released 57 years too early
1609953350,"Is the story good? Yes, it is amazing!
Are the graphics beautiful? Hell yes!
Does it run poorly on the right hardware? No, it runs very good!

But.....
The amount of bugs and glitches is really bad (Date of review: 06.01.2021)

The main story is well written and fun, but is interrupted by bugs that make dead caracters walk around, random objects appear in their hands or your companion just stops working at all.
This really rips you out of the immersion this world could offer.

Speaking of world: open world...
The trailers promised vibrant and realistic open world gameplay, with AI crowds acting like irl and NPCs being authentic and reacting to the player. That was a plain lie. AI is very very dump, crouches as soon as you shoot in the air and doesnt react to the player at all. Some NPCS of the crowd even repeat in exact clones of NPCs you just saw 5 seconds ago.

Car AI? Nope, they just drive along on pre defined rails. If something gets in the way, they stop or just despawn right away.

Combat? In general it feels very good.
But with the right skills it feels way too easy even on the high difficulty settings. Skilling into blades gives you regeneration and armor while doing combat with your arm-blades. Just spam left click trough the enemies until everything is dead.

Dont buy this game now, give it a few months or pick it up in a sale. In its current state, its not worth the 60 € at all and should be advertised as ""early access"""
1609953261,cyberpunk 2077
1609953164,it's a mess
1610015490,False publicity！Not as good as Genshin Impact!
1609953143,"Buggy but it gets the job done. It moved me, especially the Aldecaldo ending. Just wished they didn't cut down the content and delivered on what they promised."
1609953141,Love the game not as many glitches and bugs as people say atleast not game breaking ones...
1609952994,"Look, I do actually like this game. I like the combat and story but HOLY SHIT the amount of missing content from this game is fucking outstanding. The amount of times I have been one shot is just shit, I played through the whole Dark Souls Trilogy but man I got one shot in this game 10x more than I ever did in Dark Souls. 

So much is missing. Plus to me the story is just eh. I like the whole Johnny Silverhand stuff but really the characters that I have met so far just don't really interest me. The only one interesting is Johnny just because of one scene where you play as him. To me at least he has an actual back story that we know of.

Man just the missing content and broken systems in this game.

I don't mind the bugs ( very much ) but what I do mind is false promises. That CDPR said themselves it would be in the game. Proper Police systems. Meaningful choices. Different life paths. Multitude of weapons. Dynamic NPC's. They are either half arsed or they are just not in the game.  It is so disappointing. While I know there is hope among the community that CDPR gets this game up to scratch it is still an extremely disappointing start, to one of the most hyped games of all of gaming history. I do like this game. Though I don't like it enough to where I can overlook these issues. There are just some blatant things in ads that were never given to us as a player. It doesn't feel in depth I feel as I have only scratched the service of the world, but that's all the game is. The Surface. I feel like we never get past that first layer.

Getting through that first layer just never happens, as I feel that im about to make a dent in that layer then I am just riddled with bugs and reminded of missing features. That is whats really holding this game back. Not the bugs, not the story, but the missing features. I never truly got immersed in the world and if I did it would last 3 minutes. Those 3 minutes are then ruined by visual glitches. Emotional moments are ruined because of them.

I want this game to get better I really do and fast."
1609952972,"Experience with a 3080 FE and I9 9900K etc.

I love Cyberpunk 2077 so far, despite its issues. I am a rabid consumer of side content in open world RPGs and I really enjoyed all the side content so far. From very dark subplots to sillier ones there are lots of wonderful, detailed little stories to unpack - some of which actually affect the main plot in unexpected ways. This game is really a lot of fun to play and the setting is one to simply get lost in.

The real issue on everyone's mind is, of course, the operational state of the game.  I've been playing it on the Xbox Series X and though I have experienced some glitches overall it has played well and looks quite good despite running in backward compatibility mode (Read: Emulator - the native Next-Gen version is still awaiting a release date.) 

This is a genre game - Cyberpunk this time rather than the fantasy setting for Witcher 3 (which is still one of my favorite games of all time). I understand some of the criticisms about the writing; it's dark, nihilistic, almost random. These are markers for this kind genre. Noir, Horror, Westerns, Fantasy – all genres have their characteristics. So, I would humbly submit that some of the writing/plot criticisms from some reviewers may be due to just not liking the genre and its milieu.

I have experienced quite a few bugs but nothing so far that couldn't be remedied by reloading a save-game from a few minutes ago. Between my pathological quick-save habit and the games nearly as obsessive auto-save mechanism that has rarely cost me more than 10-20 minutes. 
Admittedly, working around glitches has in a way become part of how I play it. Fortunately, load times on the Xbox Series X are incredibly quick, so this issue doesn't gnaw on me the way it would for someone one who was waiting a several minutes between load screens.

Arguably, CD Project Red should not have released the title for Xbox One and PS 4 at all. That was a serious tactical blunder. Developing a release schedule years in advance carries these risks and Cyberpunk 2077 is hardly the first - nor the last - title to be caught between Scylla and Charybdis in this way.

My experience is slightly flawed but the flaws are overwhelmingly overshadowed by how great the experience is so far. But bear in mind I’ve been gaming for nearly 40 years; I remember writing my own custom .bat and .sys files on individual boot disks for each game. Dealing with some mess on a new title is normal to me; I admit it; I'm old. 

From now on, the game will only get better.

1609952932,Superbly involving game with beautiful graphics.
1609952775,"Great story, fun game play... and A LOT of bugs. Yes, it glitches out and you may need to re-load from time to time but it's a pretty solid game and I love the cyberpunk genre! After completing all of the side quests and story, I can say that I fell in love with the characters. Judy is the waifu for lifeu!"
1609952737,"It may not have delivered on all promises, but I went into the game without much prior knowledge and expected ~100 hours worth of single player entertainment and this was certainly achieved. The story and side quests told through plenty of dialogues in the very detailed environments are amazing. I am not sure about replay-value at this point, due to a limited set of decisions that ""actually"" matter.   

Had I nearly no serious bugs, and completed the majority of the playthrough on Linux (Fedora 33; Vega 56) with Proton. The Game was very stable."
1609952625,"Finished the game and played over 100 hours and got all the endings. This game is amazing. Yes it has bugs but honestly nothing crazy. Simple graphical glitches here and there. The Story is great, the game environment is vast and the city truly feels alive. 

I'm guessing people are forgetting how much of a buggy mess Skyrim was and its seen as an amazing game. Bugs in open world games are common but don't let that stop you from enjoying what this game has to offer. 

I will say this. Cyberpunk should have just been a PC exclusive game. I'm sure lots of things were put on the back burner because they were trying to get this game to work on consoles. PC MASTER RACE"
1609952588,"Game good, Bugs mildly annoying.

"
1609952572,"So, this game has had a clusterfuck of a beginning. Through CD Projeckt Red's crunch time, and the PS4 disasters, and the huge amounts of bugs, it's been wild. 
But the game is good. Like really really good. It's bugs are essentially skyrim bugs, and no one cares. good game, 8/10, and more cock customization
"
1609952337,it's good
1609952256,<3
1609952155,"The game has it's issues for sure, however, if you can manage to look past some of the minor bugs and glitches you'll get to experience some of the most beautiful visuals, some of the most well written and memorable characters and an amazing story.

Most of the issues people complain about will get fixed over time and quality of life improvements will get introduced, but it really sucks when you see that the game was obviously meant to be longer and offer more content, but had to be rushed in order to make the release deadline and realize what the actual potential of the game could have been.

I'm hoping that the next expansion includes most of the characters from the base game and continues the story, unlike the Witcher 3 expansions where it's a completely new cast and an entirely different story.

Overall, at the date of writing this review, the game gets a 8.5/10 for me, it needed more time in the oven to show it's full potential.
"
1609951951,The game is good if you want a story however the combat is tedious.
1609951920,"Game is good, want to play it, would love to play it, been trying to play it, but it crashes every 30mins or so on average, Longest I managed to play without a crash was maybe 2 hours. More often than not it's only the game that crashes, shuts itself down, I get to send a report and reboot the game, and that's it, but sometimes it hardcrashes my whole computer, causing blue screens, I bought this new computer recently with cyberpunk in mind, got a 2080rtx and a decent i7 in it.

Would normally recommend the game and will change my review if my issues get fixed, but in the meantime, I do not recommend it."
1609951888,"Bugs here and there, but stil.. story that I can care, gameplay that I can enjoy."
1609951752,"I'ma just give it to you straight.

TLDR; it's a solid 7/10 for me. Has alot of patch potentional, but we'll have to wait and see.

The game isn't a masterpiece if you go in thinking it's gonna be a reinvention of the wheel. It does it's due, and it's an amazing journey from start to finish. But it will NEVER meet the expectation and hype that was built around it. I feel like marketing a game like that is a massive mistake and will ultimately doom your game on release, especially if you already know your product will not be on par with such a hype.

Now, is it an amazing story with amazing character(s) and a story that keeps you interested? Yes.

Does it have replay value? Yes, you can get extremely experimental with the builds and try something new out every time, and it also has 3 different distinct paths you can start at the beginning of the game that tie into the story smoothly. 

Is the open world engaging and unique? Yes and no, yes as in there's a constant flow of side objectives and missions that do not play a major role in the story, but no because outside of missions the game feels kind've empty as a whole. The city's glimmer and lights fade after extensive playtime, and it feels just like another generic city.

Romances. it's an CPR MODERN RPG, does it have any? Yes, but the options are severely limited primarily based on sexual preference and gender. I disagree with this stance entirely, I personally think all the options should have been bisexual just so you could play whatever you prefer without being gender gated/locked. But of course they wanted a splash of realism.. in a technologically enhanced dystopian scenery. 

I feel like alot of options and systems were gutted on release, which sucks yes but we'll have the majority of things back in time. Is it worth the $60? Debatable, but I for one was happy to pay it, and I feel fairly compensated.

Glitches on the otherhand are in abundance in this game, but the majority of them are MINOR and FIXABLE with a quick restart. Others are either just cosmetic or too miniscule to pick up on most of the time. I think of more valid point of criticism should be on the AI which is comically terrible, once more outside of missions atleast. 

This game was designed PRIMARILY based on the story, and the street cred system was just there to fill in time inbetween, which you would usually spam gigs, or side quests to obtain. Open world itself is just mediocre, so if you're considering buying this game thinking it'll be like GTA you're sadly mistaken. It has alot of similar elements but in reality GTA's open world is far, far superior to cyberpunk's."
1609951602,If you got the computer to run it get it
1609951562,Absolute dogshit of a game
1609951508,"I really wanted to love it. I really wanted to experience the open world of Night City. 

Feels like they spent 95% of their time and money developing the story, working on the art direction, and marketing. 

If you want a linear RPG, I think its a phenomenal game. But unfortunately, it was marketed as an open world.

The rest of the 5% feels like they spent slapping their ""open world"" (Ai, NPC's, driving, interacting, etc.) from the previous gen games together in this game. If you are doing anything other than the main story missions or some of the main side missions, it gets hard to enjoy being in night city. Most things are so stale, under developed, unintelligent, and really breaks the immersive feel of the game.

So many promises, so many lies. Even CD Projekt Red."
1609951480,"Everything you've heard about the glitches in this game is true. Even as of 1.06, there are graphical glitches like floating cigarettes or pop-in characters that are a huge drag on immersion in conversations. You will sometimes be taken out of stealth for bumping into an object and instantly seen by enemies. The list goes on.

I still recommend this game wholeheartedly.

The world and the characters that this game has created is simply captivating. It is absolutely worth your time to play, warts and all. Don't want to pay full price for it or want to wait until more patches are in? Totally reasonable. I waited over a month from launch myself, and I don't regret it. But it should absolutely be on your to-play list."
1609951428,"Really love more with the story, great music and bugs

To hell with it for someone can't get enjoy this game because keeps compare GTA V and sh*t."
1609951405,fun game filled with bugs short and sweet review but there you have it i would give it 7 out of 10 would of been higher but i had so many bugs

1609950624,its not worth the money
1609950583,"Recomendo o jogo, com ressalvas.

Joguei com as especificações mínimas, e só tive problemas em momentos específicos do jogo em que eu dirigia de uma região para outra e meu PC não dava conta de carregar e processar todos os elementos, e o frame rate ficava na apresentação de slides. Na maior parte do tempo, o jogo rodou razoavelmente bem, e mesmo com as especificações mínimas, o jogo é bem bonito. Muito mais do que o bonito técnico, este jogo é bonito esteticamente. A cidade é realista, e cada canto parece ter uma história. Quando você sai de uma rua movimentada, cheia de propagandas passando e gente andando, você vai pra uma ponte mais escura. Na beira da ponte tem uma escada enferrujada, e se você descer vai achar cabanas de papelão e sucata com toneis com fogo aceso, e gente usando móveis descartados. É um lugar que parece vivo, com pessoas de verdade vivendo nele.

Em termos de gameplay, eu gostei bastante. O jogo permite personalizar seu personagem, e acabei fazendo um hacker / assassino silencioso que limpava os lugares da missão sem despertar nenhum alarme, mas que poderia ter sido um Rambo ou mesmo um samurai. O sistema de pontos é complexo, e penso que um pouco desbalanceado: tem talentos que te dão +15% de dano contra humanos, e talentos que te dão 5% de chance de não consumir recursos ao fabricar um equipamento. Acho que patches futuros vão balancear isso. De toda forma, não foi algo que me incomodou muito.

O jogo tem bugs. Vários deles. São texturas que demoram a carregar, carros que aparecem nas ruas debaixo de outros carros quando você chega numa região e acaba vendo os carros mais distantes pulando, gente em pose T até quando você chega perto e elas começam a usar a animação correta... Isso foi bem abundante. Eu não sou uma pessoa que se incomoda muito com isso, mas é algo que quebra a imersão de muita gente.

O que eu mais gostei no jogo foi o ritmo. Ele é bem próximo do Witcher 3, em termos de narrativa. Você não aparece numa fase atirando. Tem todo um contexto, uma explicação, uma conversa com quem te dá a missão, a oportunidade de perguntar detalhes, um tempo para preparação, a viagem até o local, aí sim, entra a missão de fato. E muitas vezes, quando a missão termina, ainda tem um pós-missão que frequentemente amarra com o ponto onde a história vai progredir. Em muitos aspectos, essa narrativa parece um filme: existem momentos de ação, momentos de conversa, momentos de tensão, resolução ou frustração. Este jogo não é uma bomba de adrenalina, mas sim um jogo pra ser jogado num ritmo mais lento.

No mais, gostei muito do que vi, e recomendo o jogo. É uma pena eu não ter um computador milionário de última geração pra rodar com tudo no máximo, mas estou contente com o que vi. A história não é tão boa quanto a do Witcher 3, mas o mesmo pode ser dito de 99% dos jogos que já joguei. Mesmo assim, é uma história humana, e que convida a inúmeras reflexões filosóficas e existencialistas, se você gosta deste tipo de coisa. Eu definitivamente gosto."
1609950457,"At a month after release, there are still some bugs - I don't think I can deny that.  None of them have been gamebreaking, nor anything that couldn't be resolved with a quit to desktop and a reload

I give CDPR this much... the game evokes a LOT of feelings.  Affection, revulsion, hatred, anger, concern, hope.
It may have some technical challenges but it's got some fabulous storytelling.

Overall I highly recommend it.  It's massive in scale and complexity, the gameplay is good, and it's a narrative (dystopian) dream."
1609950405,"There are a lot of bugs, that's a fact.
Driving a car is a horror sometimes.
I think AI is pretty stupid,

The story, the graphics I think are very good

[b] [u] PROS [/u] [/b]
-Stuninng visual immersion: the city is amazing in every aspect, all areas have their own distinct feeling, the verticality. there are no two similar rooms in the game
-Fantastic audio as well (car sounds, radios, voices, city ambient sounds)
-Fairly good class and leveling system which provides many different playstyles. great replayability because of that
-really good side question storylines (especially liked the Peralez quests)
-no gamebreaking bugs from me
-tons of easter eggs
-great quest system. very convenient with the mobile calls

[b] [u] OK [/u] [/b]
-decent driving experience (except sch1tty starting car)
-combat could be developed but ok

[b] [u] CONS [/u] [/b]
-tons of minor glitches
-bad overall AI: traffic, pedestrians, enemies are kinda dumb
-police is really a shame
-short main storyline
-difficulty does not really scale well, at least in mission list, i still managed
-high crafting seems to be a must, which i really didnt like
-origin (Streetkid/Nomad/Corpo) could have greater impact"

1609949270,"Vintage chocolate chip cookies

Ingredients
150g salted butter, softened
80g light brown muscovado sugar
80g granulated sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
1 large egg
225g plain flour
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
¼ tsp salt
200g plain chocolate chips or chunks
Method
STEP 1
Heat the oven to 190C/fan170C/gas 5 and line two baking sheets with non-stick baking paper.

STEP 2
Put 150g softened salted butter, 80g light brown muscovado sugar and 80g granulated sugar into a bowl and beat until creamy.

STEP 3
Beat in 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 large egg.

STEP 4
Sift 225g plain flour, ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda and ¼ tsp salt into the bowl and mix it in with a wooden spoon.

STEP 5
Add 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks and stir well.

STEP 6
Use a teaspoon to make small scoops of the mixture, spacing them well apart on the baking trays. This mixture should make about 30 cookies.

STEP 7
Bake for 8–10 mins until they are light brown on the edges and still slightly soft in the centre if you press them.

STEP 8
Leave on the tray for a couple of mins to set and then lift onto a cooling rack.

RECIPE TIPS
FREEZING THE BISCUITS
If you’ve frozen the biscuits, take them out and arrange them on a lined baking sheet. Once defrosted, pop them in a medium oven 190C/170 fan/gas mark 5 and heat for 2-3 mins to crisp up. Don’t leave them too long or they’ll dry out.
STORING DOUGH
You can keep the uncooked dough in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Simply take some out, dollop on a lined baking tray and allow to come up to room temperature for 5 mins before baking."
1609949154,"Graphics 9.5/10
If you got the gear you gonna appreciate the graphics, it embraces the next gen concept. Solid lightning, pleasant facial animations. Highly detailed futuristic world with interesting design concepts almost on every corner of the Night city.

Story 8/10
It is above average but does not come any close to inonic/legendary games, the concept of Silverhand might come as unique but gets annoying pretty early in the game.
Side quests vary from ""breathtaking"" to completely pointless grind similar to Far Cry.

Experience 6/10
Stepping from main quest might disappoint, especially if you decide to go full completionist, mini question marks become repetitive, the AI of regular NPCs is stuck somewhere in early 2000s, a lot of wasted potential.
Shooting is fun and dynamic soundtrack helps, driving is average but vehicle variety makes up for it considering this game is not about cars.

Overall 7.5 and I still recommend this game"
1609949154,"A very rewarding experience. There are crashes when my rig runs hot but not game-breaking and not what the reviews may lead you to believe. If you have powerful enough hardware, this is a must-play experience. The story balances seriousness and humor and the immersion is the best I have seen in a while."
1609949123,Very good gaming experience. Has some bugs but didn't bother me that much.
1609948990,"[h1]The Good[/h1]

[b]Writing and story.[/b] [i]Cyberpunk[/i]'s writing is top notch: Mature, insightful, artful, and consistent. It takes on ambitious themes, and it impressively makes them human and relevant despite the futuristic setting. The characters have depth and personality, and they are genuinely interesting. It's fair to say that not [i]all[/i] of the writing is perfect, but it is a huge game with a ton of content, after all. My friends and I agree that, in the writing department, [i]Cyberpunk[/i] makes up for the disappointment of [i]Borderlands 3[/i] (which fell painfully short of the standard set by [i]Borderlands 2[/i]).

[b]Faithful setting.[/b] I've played a good amount of [i]Cyberpunk 2020[/i] at the tabletop, but not nearly as much as my wife. She and her friends practically lived in that world as teens, and she's got the Chromebooks almost memorized. She even had the good fortune to play in a campaign run by Mike Pondsmith himself. She has been waiting without hope for decades to see a satisfying video game adaptation, so it means a [i]lot[/i] to say that she is not disappointed. It quickly occurred to me that, being a hardcore Tolkien fan, this game is to her what Peter Jackson's [i]Lord of the Rings[/i] films were to me. This game was clearly made by people with a tremendous knowledge of and respect for the source material.

[b]Visuals.[/b] You don't need me to tell you that [i]Cyberpunk[/i] has awesome graphics. Just go look up some screenshots and videos. What I will add, however, is that the art department went above and beyond in using the visuals to make the world real and immersive, not just ""look really cool"". There's fashion design that reinforces the idea that look and rep are everything, so that the style of a character's chrome and clothes instantly gives you a read on who they are. There's technical design that encompasses shiny new corporate tech that's almost magical, ""old"" 2060's tech bolted onto 20th-century relics, and everything in between--and all of it rendered with concern as to how it actually works. And there's commercial design that hammers home that the corps of the world smother the masses with consumerism.

[b]No microtransactions.[/b] This is a small thing, but I appreciate it. There are no premium cosmetics, no pre-order or ""deluxe edition"" exclusives, no upselling. CD Projekt Red occasionally reminds me that I can have a few bonuses if I sign up for an online account, but that's all. Paid DLC may come in the future, and some form of microtransactions may come along with a multiplayer mode, if such a thing materializes.

[h1]The Middling[/h1]

[b]Leveled-looter.[/b] [i]Cyberpunk[/i] has a Diablo-style loot system. Found equipment has rarity, as well as randomly-generated ""elemental"" damage and other bonuses. New loot is leveled relative to the character (as are enemies), so old loot is continuously becoming obsolete. I really did not expect this of [i]Cyberpunk[/i], and I could really do without it. It's the biggest aspect of the game that goes against the classic Cyberpunk feel. Fortunately, as you build a collection of quasi-unique ""iconic"" gear, you can begin to ignore the vast majority of stuff, except as crafting material. But more on the shortcomings of that later...

[b]Repetition.[/b] The game world is very large, on a similar scale to recent open-world games from Bethesda and Rockstar. That's great and all, but it means that if you try to fill the whole world with stuff to do, you risk running out of variety. [i]Cyberpunk[/i] ran out of variety. I have grown bored of an endless cycle of responding to a crime in progress, killing a squad of four to eight gangbangers, finding a scrap of written-down conversation that explains a petty crime, and getting paid for my freelance police work. The genuine side quests are mostly not much better, though some are more interesting. The real meat is in the main quests, and these feel watered down by the overabundance of popcorn jobs. To be honest, they didn't need to make the game so big.

[b]Light on choice.[/b] I love an RPG that lets me define my character and the course of events through a variety of choices. Enabling this on a grand scale is great, but just doing it on the level of individual quests is nice too. Two games that have really impressed me in this regard are [i]Fallout: New Vegas[/i] and [i]Vampire: Bloodlines[/i]. [i]Cyberpunk[/i] falls well short of these. To be fair, there are dialog options that let me express a differentiated character, such as life goals and attitude toward corps, but overall these aren't very meaningful.

Worst of all, there are a few side quests that really feel like I [i]should[/i] be able to steer them toward one outcome or another, but they end up being on rails. If I've been working with a fixer who has a strong interest in treating cyberpsychosis, why can't I call her up when there's an obvious potential psycho asking me to help cover a murder? If the guy who wants to dramatically end his life is so insistent that I hang around and talk to him, why is there no chance to talk him out of it? It's disappointing.

[b]Single player.[/b] At this time, there is no multiplayer mode. I don't think there's any way they could have bolted multiplayer onto the normal campaign that wouldn't suck, so that's okay. But finding an elegant way to allow me to play through a Night City story with friends would be awesome. If done well enough, I might even pay a DLC price for it. There is hope that this will happen in the future.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]

[b]Bugs.[/b] At this time, release 1.06, the PC edition is still suffering from plenty of small-to-medium glitches. Road traffic popping in and out of existence. Waypoints getting confused. Loot that can't be looted. Falling through the world. Entire stacks of items becoming immune to dismantling. Most of it is only annoying, if you save often, but there is one major batch of side quests that for me seems to be unfinishable. CD Projekt Red has already released a few patches, so I have hope that they're still actively working on these.

[b]Loot management.[/b] Since I was already displeased that Cyberpunk is a looter game at all, it only makes it worse that vital features are missing that would make playing a looter less of a waste of time. It's hard to generalize, so here are some examples.

Gear clearly has levels, and you can spend increasing amounts of crafting material to up the level. However the level itself is not shown, [i]unless[/i] it's above yours or you try to upgrade above yours. Level and number of past upgrades are vital stats that should be revealed.

There is an unlimited stash, but there is no ""retrieve all"" function, nor can it be filtered. Emptying and filling the stash are extremely tedious.

An entire skill branch is dedicated to crafting and upgrading gear. A keystone skill allows for crafting materials themselves to be upgraded in rarity, which should be a game changer as the rarer materials really are precious. However, you are only allowed to do this one material at a time. To be clear, we're talking about items that you will have [i]and need[/i] in stacks of thousands. So you [i]could[/i] take your excess thousands of common parts and reforge them into legendary. But you won't, because it would literally take hours of holding and releasing the mouse button, thousands of times. That's just egregious.

I hope that in a future release, the designers will rethink and revamp, if not the entire loot system (as Ubisoft did for [i]Ghost Recon: Breakpoint[/i]), at least the features surrounding loot management, crafting, and upgrading. Right now, it's just bad.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

[i]Cyberpunk 2077[/i] is a great game. On balance, I'm enjoying it. However, it's got plenty of missing polish. If you didn't feel the need to buy it already, it won't hurt you to wait a while and see what happens. You just might be able to get a less frustrating game at a discount price."

A DIZASTER.

I dont bother to mutch with BUGS ( manny) i talk more about the game overall expirience.
The bigest issue of the game is NO ENEMY LV SCALING.  After u reach LV 20+ many quests turn into WERY ESSY no mether if u playa on HARDEST DIFICULITY like i do. After u get here ewen MAIN QUEST BOSES shoot u for 2 minits and cant kil u while u stay in front of em. And i dont use ewen any upgrades at all from riperdogs or armor and using guns from LV 5-10 to have atlest a decent chalenge.

1609948223,Over 90 hours in this game. Fantastic
1609948054,"Is it buggy? Yes. Do many mechanics feel missing or incomplete? Yeah. But I still love this mess because even through all of its bullshit, the game is still fun and shows the potential to right its wrongs and become a perfect game. In it's current state it shows it was well designed but poorly implemented. There is some excellent writing, animations, voice acting, graphics, and cars but things just weren't implemented as well as they should have been. Yet I still find myself loving this mess in its current state and can't wait until it gets some more time from the devs."
1609948270,Бабка Шельма за место того что бы присесть на хер Серебрерукого шизоида решился взорваться от гранаты в обнимку со Смешером 0/10
1610016800,"This game keeps not a single one of CDPR's promises. If all you're looking for are the most shallow game mechanics with beautiful looks, and an overall very easy game, then go for it.

The only enjoyable part of the game for me is the story at this point. It's really well-written, superbly acted, and quite heart-breaking. Just don't look at anything for too long lest it fall apart right in front of your eyes.
AI, driving, missions, RPG elements, balancing, real consequences of actions, trams, transmog, gang and reputation system, curruptible police, ... none if it has nearly the fidelity that was promised, if it even exists in the game. Half the things that were shown as functioning game mechanics in trailers are. not. in. the. game.
Almost all aspects of the open wold are done better in GTA IV and that was released in 2008. 
Not even its namesake is present, really. There's basically no cyberpunk. Transhumanism is hinted at in the most shallow way possible and neither explored nor reflected (unless you count cyberphychosis, that is there. And technically there's Lizzie's Mission, too, but that's the extent of it).
Half the open world is you working with/for the system instead of fighting it and Johnny is good for nothing but platitudes. 
Bugs can - and will - be fixed. But the game needs nothing short of a rewrite to come even close to what was marketed."
1609947903,Wake tf up samurai we got a city to save
1609947889,"A good game , Good story, replayable yes absolutely , The game plenty and sexy customization of character,Clothing and weapons that gives players the possebility to have different play styles and when they have made the game less buggy and added even more things and some slight balancing it will be even better . For the best experience wait until summer 2021 before playing and whit a strong PC whit a abselut minimum a 1060 or similar granpics card"
1609948140,"Where to start....I remember reading about this game back in the 2012-2013 in my Game Informer Mag and have been looking forward to it's release since. 
     
First of all this game is amazing for what it can be...The story and side quests are amazing. Great character NPCs, missions/quests aren't all the same cookie cutter stuff so that's good as well. Graphics are amazing (assuming your PC is up the task). Sound/Radio/voice acting is top notch.
     
The bad...Game is very bare bones as far as an (RPG style) game goes. Almost feels like this game is Early Access. I've poured almost 100hrs into Cyberpunk and have enjoyed it but there's always that ""only if"" or ""why don't they have"" voice in the back of you mind as your playing. Game is fun story wise and yes it does have a ton of issues but it is playable and can be enjoyable depending on if you like ""early access"". Cyberpunk is leagues above Fallout 76 and Anthem in terms of release condition. If this game was a ""live service"" experience i'd say it would've done as bad as Fallout76 and Anthem. 
I do recommend the game but only if you don't mind the early access feeling. I can only hope that they will fix the issues with the game and reintroduce the features they kept bragging about. I can see where this game will be amazing but it will be in due time. I am looking forward and hoping for a great future with Cyberpunk but for now I'll take a break and play some games I got on the steam holiday sales.

TL:DR
Game is fun (Story/missions/characters) saved it for me but it really feels like an Early Access game swamped by common Early Access issues and lack of features or depth at the moment. Is it worth it? Depends on your tolerance for Early Access AAA titles. If you're on the fence about this purchase, then i'd say wait until the real Cyberpunk 1.0 is released."
1609947612,"The game has no happy endings. 

I believe a game has to offer its player at least one happy ending for there to be a happy ending for the game itself. To quote the artificial intelligence from the movie classic Wargames: 

""Strange game. The only way of winning is not to play. How about a nice game of chess?""

There is no point in returning the player to the save 'Point of no return' after the credits. I think few players will want to continue with a V that is coughing blood and is more dead than alive to play additional sidequests. A better solution would be to state that V has been fully cured and can now continue to enjoy what Night City has to offer. Players need a reward to strive for."
1609947584,"tons of fun, few bugs here and there but haven't had any game breaking bugs"
1609947555,"Amazing Game Amazing graphics, yes there are bugs, yes some are funny, some are ridiculous. But i have already seen a big improvement, and considering the amaing world they created and the detail there is just about everywhere, I fully recommend this game even at full price. They are promising a No Man's Sky comeback and I for one am excited to see the future of Cyberpunk"
1609947368,"7/10 It's a fun linear story with good gameplay.

The issues I have surround the lack of autonomy V has. V's backstory doesn't matter, you can't choose to help one clan/gang over another, there's no consequences to choosing one option over the other, and you get the same endings no matter what you do. The most freedom you have in the game is in the combat. Otherwise you're basically just a tourist to Night City following CD Projeck Red's tour guides."
1609947358,"Plot and dialog writing was great, including sidequests. The city where most of the action takes place is very detailed and compelling. A great diversity of character builds is possible. The moment I finished my first playthrough, I launched a second one to try a different build on a higher difficulty.

Most bad reviews seem to stem from bugs, which I mostly didn't encounter, and from too high expectations because of the online hype machine. Manage your expectations, it is just a game and will not cure disease or end world hunger, and you will have fun.

good game 77/20 would despair and commit die on a skyscraper while crying over my digital boyfriend / other self again"
1609947157,"Excellent story. As an adventure-RPG in an open world it's a really enjoyable experience with well written NPCs. The open world itself could use a few extra activities, but I'am more interessted in a good story/experience than a ton of useless side stuff.

AI and ""gigs"" sidequests could be a bit more fleshed out. That will hopefully comes in the next DLCs.

Played it on a new PC, so the visual and atmosphere was really good. A few bugs here and there, but nothing making it unplayable (at least for now and with the latest patches)"
1609947117,"Good game with good characters.
Still can't drive..."
1609946997,"Game was brilliant, loved the story line just too short."
1609946974,"Forget the bugs, just play it"
1609946793,Good
1609946760,lots of bugs because the community forced them to release it early but its still fun
1609946687,It's ok.
1609946660,"A very good game (9/10). Great aesthetic, story, levelling, replay-ability etc.... I have around 70 hours in the game and could easily go back and play through it again (and I will after the free DLC!)"
1609946589,"Honestly the game can be really engaging 40% of the time and then the other 60% of the time it's frustrating you with how disengaging some of the side content and glitches breaking the city, cutscenes, gameplay. Hell I owned this on both PS4 (yikes I know) and PC. Refunded on both. Ladies and Germs please wait until it's on sale in the bargain bin and has all the expansion content because at that point it'll be where it needs to be as a CD Project Red game."
1609946538,i love this game.
1609946530,"Great story line, did it twice. lots of bugs, most were funny. I would say to buy this game in a month or two, just because."
1609946444,"Lots of bugs but nothing game breaking 7/10, its not the revolutionary game everyone was hoping for but it is still a great game"
1609946352,"It's a good fucking game it has a goddamn amazing fuckin storyline and the motherfucking character customization is so fucking insane. Keanu reeves is fucking cool. This game is fucking breathtaking. The only thing is the bugs but bitch it's gonna get fucking fixed so stop bitching over stuff like the bugs it's good game don't even crack it cuz it has no drm the rich homies at projekt red deserve more money and less bitching its on all u that kept saying ""omfg they delayed the game again wtf are they doing"" sure it didn't deserve the overhype but that's also on ur dumbasses and let's be honest the majority of pissed off fucks are the bums on consoles that can't run it for shit like bitch fuck off"
1609946306,"This game has a lot of potential. At the time of this review (version 1.06), there are still a lot of bugs. Thankfully, almost all of them are immersion-breaking rather than game-breaking. In 101 hours of play, I have run into about 197 instances of bugs/weird issues (I take a screenshot each time), and really only 1 of them that I can recall was game-breaking, where I had a side-quest to save someone and they were speaking Chinese or something instead of English, despite V answering in English as if the NPC was speaking English. Bugs aside...

[b][u]OVERALL[/b]: I really like this game. It's consumed almost all of my gaming time, and is a nice mixture of Deux Ex meets Altered Carbon.[/u]

Here are things I really like, followed by things I dislike and would like to see improved. Trying to keep this spoiler-free as best as I can. I might have more items in the 'dislike' category, but overall I really like this game and see it's potential.

[hr][/hr]
[h1]LIKES:[/h1]

- [b]Night City[/b]: It's beautifully done and the design and architecture is just amazing. Perhaps my biggest gripe would be that almost all streets don't have names (street signs) so it's next to impossible to really learn the city (especially given it's size), so you almost always have to rely on your GPS.

- [b]Characters[/b]: Many of the important NPCs have pretty great design, stories, and lines

- [b]Different ways to play a mission[/b]: Brings me back to the Deux Ex days, although it would be nice if some missions where you have to go un-detected could also mean you have to not kill anyone, since it's possible to silently kill everyone and still finish the mission ""without knowing you were there""... umm, they're all dead? Someone didn't notice something happened?

- [b]Brain Dances[/b]: Such a cool concept and great way to convey story and change up gameplay. My only complaint is that brain dances are so few and far between, and always related to a mission. Where are the brain dances just to have fun with brain dances?! This great feature is so underused.

- [b]Side Missions[/b]: They're great and often quite detailed and lengthy (when you consider the whole side-story arc).

- [b]Gigs[/b]: They usually tend not to get (too) boring.

- [b]Decisions[/b]: It's nice to have decisions which can change the game (however so slightly), and it's really great to see decisions which have a very short time limit so you have to act fast. Now I just have to get used to reading the prompts quickly haha.

- And let's not forget about the [b]Main Story[/b] which so far has been amazing!

[hr][/hr]
[h1]DISLIKES / AREAS THAT SHOULD BE IMPROVED:[/h1]

- The AI in general. I'll break this down into individual areas:

-- [b]Police[/b]: The police system is all sorts of broken. They spawn almost right next to you, they don't chase you (in vehicles), and it's super easy to lose your tail. Just move away and poof. Fix that. Bring in car chases. Bring in police when you're doing certain missions for added difficulty and realism. Add more interaction with them aside from just the open world quests.

-- [b]Combat AI[/b]: They're generally not aggressive enough. Once fighting starts, they pretty much just hunker down. I can stay behind cover almost indefinitely to reload and heal while they just sit there taunting me and throwing the occasional grenade. (I'm playing on 'hard' difficulty).

-- [b]Netrunners[/b]: They're not as powerful as they should be. Why can't they use the cripple movement or reboot optics on me? Or make it fun and use the denote grenade! Netrunners are really just an annoyance rather than a real threat.

-- [b]NPC cars[/b]: They often end up crashing into each other, especially when turning. Then they just sit there and do nothing until they despawn. Same if they crash into me/I crash into them. Why not have them leave their vehicle and initiate a fight/activate a (fixed) police system? Also... if you park your vehicle on the side of the road, you grind traffic to a halt! So immersion-killing!

- [b]NPC motorcycles[/b]: Where are they? Am I the only one who actually rides one?

- [b]The sex scenes[/b]: Leave much to be desired here. They break immersion in that they're just snippets and so you don't really feel like you're in the game anymore, and there are no player choices (positions, speech, when to stop, etc)

- [b]Crafting system[/b]: The crafting system in this game is like the food system in Breath Of The Wild. So much potential and in the end, pretty much useless. Especially since you can't upgrade components until you've gained so much XP in crafting so you just disassemble all your inventory just to stock up until you can upgrade. I really wish crafting didn't exist and instead added more functionality to gun stores.

- [b]The upgrade system[/b]: Similar to crafting above, but at least I use it. It's just expensive when you can't upgrade components unless you do a truck-tone of crafting first.

- [b]Armor and weapon stats[/b]: This might be the most annoying aspect of the game for me. I absolutely HATE that armor and weapons can have different armor/DPS stats, even among the same level of rarity. It means if you want the best armor, you have to dress like a damn clown. Armor should be primarily based on the TYPE of clothing you wear, and secondly on your levels and perks. Weapons should be the same. Primarily on the TYPE of weapon, and secondly on levels and perks. And get rid of the rarity levels, except for the iconic items.

- [b]Weapon variety[/b]: Given everything else in this game, the variety of different weapons is pretty weak. Especially when you consider the hundreds of different weapons available in real life today.

- [b]Gasoline vehicles[/b]: Welcome to 2077.. We have megabuildings, implanted eyes, the ability to create a construct, brain dances, netrunning, but all our vehicles still use internal combustion engines... huh?

- [b]Your telephone and journal[/b]: Pretty disorganized, and when you have a dozen or so side-quests and gigs going on, it's hard to remember who gave you what mission and when, so you show up at the mission and don't remember why you're there. It would be nice if a journal entry would link back to a telephone (message) entry.

- [b]Melee combat[/b]: It's really underused. I haven't used blades, mantis blades or the monowire at all in this playthrough! Because... there's no reason to unless that's your playstyle. Heck even fists is not my playstyle but I have to level that up for the 'Beat the brat' side-quests. Why not introduce missions where for whatever reason you cannot use guns.

- [b]Character customization[/b]: You spend so much time creating your V.. and it's so underused in the game. You rarely see yourself.. in fact only on 3 occasions: The inventory screen, 3rd person view when driving, and mirrors. It would be nice for customization to be more visible in game, and also for them to actually affect gameplay or attributes.

- Which brings me to... [b]mirrors[/b]: WTF! They're so useless and I believe do way more harm to the game than good. I have to ""activate"" a mirror, wait for it to turn on, and then... smile.. Such a poor feature.

- [b]Dolls and joytoys[/b]: Why aren't there more of them? Sex is so prevalent in the game (stores, NPC attire, character lines, etc) yet the lack of this really kinda breaks the immersion.

- [b]Relationships[/b]: Once you develop relationships with certain NPCs, outside of the scripted scenes, the relationship ends. Especially once you finish the side-quest story arc. Why can't you randomly (once a day or whatever) meet up with that NPC to hook up, or meet for lunch, or something. It's really immersion breaking when you finish an NPC story arc early in the game and they then fall off the Earth until later in the story when they become important again. Pretty sure my GF would dump me if I did that!

I'd write more.. but I guess I hit Steam's character limit. Not sure, it doesn't say. My first review."
1609946252,"This Game has Amazing Story but is missing quiet a bit, It look like a husk of how the Game Could have been, The City is Breath Taking and Chocking you with all the Bad Bugs at the same time, One sec you could be having the time of your life and the next  the T pose NPCS are back. This games lacks Side content there are great side quest but no other content expect hat"
1609946211,"The good: The story's really good and the side quests are as detailed & fun as those in the witcher 3. Environment graphics are amazing
The bad: Gameplay Mechanics ad AI are terrible. Character models look animated, and aren't on par with the environment graphics. 
The ugly: I wish there were more things to do such as in gta [change clothes, minigames, barber shops, mid-game character customisation etc]  The ripperdocs are basic af, like..the body modification thingie is so limited and so basic. I was expecting a detailed customisation but this is disappointing honestly [like double jump? MID AIR JUMP?? SuPeR PuNcH???]

CDPR said ""Coming when it's out"". But it really just shows they changed their priorities from perfecting the game to putting it out there asap, mid-way through the production. The game honestly feels shallow. 

IS IT A GOOD EXPERIENCE- yes
SHOULD YOU BUY IT RIGHT NOW- no, wait until they fix the technical issues and perhaps add some missing features too"

1609946021,good stuff
1609945900,"I just finished the main story and my emotions are mixed.I would recommend the game for sure, but the ending for me was a bit lackluster. I had 54 hours of great fun and then i decided to continue and go at the point of no return of the story.Boss fight,dialogue ,voice acting all great,
SPOILERS BELOW: but the fact that you return where you were after finishing the story of V like nothing happened is stupid. At the Arasaka ending you have Panam screaming on you at the phone and then you come out of the building you call her and she says she missed you like u never went to space.Also the whole six months of life left had no reason to be at the story.Unless they do something with the DLC i find it stupid and it makes not wont to finish the side missions and gigs i i left unfinished."

1609945793,All hail T-pose
1609945720,"Amazing quality and detail, driven story followed with a multitude of side stories and missions to help feel truly connected to Night City in your own fashion."
1609945453,"I did not follow Cyberpunk 2077 leading up to its release, just gonna jumped on when it was available. Cannot speak to the overpromising/underdelivering. 

That said, it's a fun shoot-em-up RPG. I thought there would be more customization options and opportunities to reformat one's character (looks or abilities), so I was disappointed with that. The story is pretty great, though. Basically a cyberpunk Far Cry with more RPG elements. If that's your thing, this is the game."
1609945304,couldnt run it lloldsflo
1609945253,"Fun main story,  good for 100 hours +"
1609959949,"CB2077 is buggy and riddled with problems such as subpar AI, a frustatingly basic way of handling crowd generation and the Wanted System. Furthermore questionable perk balancing, the irrelevancy of attribute points and a general lack of activities paired with surprinsing little depth to almost all features, such as the crafting system or the cyberware customization leave much to be desired.
On top of this some features you might expect from a game like this are fully absent from CB2077, e.g. character customization after creation or some form of vehicle customization.
All these issues together with those too small to bring up clearly convey that the game launched too early and should have spent more time in development.

Storywise, the game is fine. Some sidequests really shine and speak to one of CDPR's strengths, but can feel short or not complete, as if their continuation is planned for some DLC.
For me, the visual aesthethic misses the mark of what I expected from the cyberpunk genre, while it can provide enjoyable noir vibes, granted you are listening to the correct radio station.

It's clear CB2077 would have benefitted from another year in development for a much needed polish, but for what it is, it's enjoyable and gets too bad of a reputation - as long as you play on PC."
1609944919,"This game is absolutely beautiful! The game play is super fun. The dialogue options are witty, and actually effect the outcome of the story. The customizations seem almost endless. I feel like I have barley scratch the surface of the game and I'm already looking forward to the many play throughs that will most definitely happen. But mostly, have fun picking out your Dick."

1609944835,Runs like dick on any kind of pc and steam refuses to refund it.
1609944799,"Really not as glitchy and bad as everybody has said, personally think it a great first person rpg"
1609944760,"gun play is boring its just shooting people until they die since they don't even react to the led entering they're bodies 
Story is great didn't even finish the game and i can tell you its the only good part i have seen
The bugs are funny as hell but if you're looking for a serious game this ain't it chief
the emphasized the hacking way too much its not fun doing it and honestly a little broken
don't buy this game until they fix almost everything unless your just their for the story and don't care about the side quests then its alright
I'll see if my opinions change when i finish this mess"
1609944889,"My expectations were that of TW3 in Cyberpunk skin.  So based on that, it met my expectations, starting at 1.06.  
There is a lot of polish still required, floating objects, frozen animations, and cut content according all the post release information out there.  As such, the open world portion of the game needs more time.

Driving could be a lot better, especially in first person, no rear view mirror, side mirrors, blind spot monitoring or backup cameras in 2077!  Vehicle handing and traction needs to be a lot better.

Good presentation of the main quest and major side quests.  Minor side quests are nice too. 
***Recommend if you want to see the main (and major side quests) story now with polishing issues .  Not recommend if you want to experience the open world.***"
1609944725,"It's easy to jump on the band wagon and calling this game a flop, but technical issues and an inexcusable console port, this game is still a massive achievement and you will find enjoyment in it. Hopefully in the future when the diamond is uncovered the game will be seen for the good in it and the launch won't taint it forever"
1609944640,"boobs guns keanu reaves and drugs, how much more do you need in a video game??? 11/10 really makes you feeel like V"
1609944571,"there are some bugs not even going to lie, but this game is so immersive all the different customizations are amazing. the story is also very fun and keeps me on my feet wanting to come back for more"
1609944541,"Overall this game just isn't that fun to play. The story offers only an illusion of choice and at times feels like a slog to get through it. Core gameplay mechanics could use some polish or a complete rework; gunplay is just 'ok', it's not satisfying in any way. Driving is a complete mess, think Ubisoft but worse. Crafting and hacking feel like they're a trial mode of what they could be. 
In terms of open world games this lacks so much polish, in terms of polish this is sitting next to bethesda, not even close to rockstar quality. Games such as ghost recon may not has as much diverse gameplay but the polish to what they do have and the world makes this game look like an unfinished indy title. 
If you have money to burn you might enjoy the story and the setting. Otherwise I'd put this firmly into the 'meh' category. Solid 5/10.

1609944481,Just play the game and have you're own opinion. I like it.
1609944330,"I agree with most, if not all, of the negative comments.  But damned if it isn't fun af ;)"
1609944311,it needs a little fixing up but overall its a really great game cant wait to see futher updates

1609944255,Great game and well worth the wait!
1609944231,this is my favorite game ive ever played i had fun playing through the whole story i hgihly recommend this game to anyone
1609944051,"While this game does have a fair number of issues, it is a good game. The elements of the story are fantastic, the characters seem alive and all have their own unique stories and emotions. On the other side, I feel my rig is fairly well equipped to handle games at high or ultra quality with good frames, but not Cyberpunk. I had to turn several settings down to low or custom just to get frame rates that were higher than 15 while driving. There are also frequent yet minor audio glitches still happening, although I haven't encountered any serious bugs since the new patch has released. 

Overall I would recommend this game. If you can't stomach the hype that it doesn't live up to, or handle some bugs, wait to buy it for a while. I'm sure it will get better with those things over time. Having said that I love the game and can't wait to see what the studio does with it in the future."
1609944035,"Its a fun time
"
1609943979,Although it's buggy as all hell sometimes this is exactly the game i've been waiting all these years for. In a way the glitchiness is a jab by the company to why a great detailed oriented game shouldn't be rushed to get released. I would have gladly waited another 5 years for this game to come out. But i'll settle for the glitches and just appreciate how they are in themselves a reflection of the anti-corporation theme of the game.
1609943762,"Pro:
Good Story And character
Cons:
CD PROJECT RED LIED ABOUT EVERYTHING,Ai dosen t exist,basic gameplay, choices don't really matter,shitty physic and driving physic, World is empty and it dosen't feel alive in any way, no point in upgrade for abilty,bad performance,glitchy audio,SO MANY BUG and finally so many missing feature from the gameplay show before release don't believe me ? watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CymqHdNYkg&ab_channel=BeatEmUps.
my final verdict, PLAY YAKUZA:Like a dragon instead or Red Dead Redemption 2 they are better in everything.

1609947247,"While it's definitely buggy and needs more polish the world of Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the best I've seen in a long time, if not ever."
1609943561,"Great game, probably one of, if not the single most advanced game of it's kind to date. Many players complain about glitches and issues, however; this title is very playable with a good configuration (don't try to achieve amazing results if you have a less than amazing graphics card or PC, just go with the recommended settings unless you have the hardware and knowledge to optimize your set up). The performance of this game utilizing Ray Tracing on the RTX 2060 Super and the RTX 3070 is just great. The game has many facets, it can be played as a shoot and loot, has some mystery search aspects, a great line up of crafting and inventory gameplay, and this comes together with a main story that has multiple outcomes depending on player choices throughout the storyline. Bags of playability, an A+ for advancement in graphical technology, top marks for the storyline too. Very few glitches and so, so much bang for your buck, a huge open world and hopefully a new standard in game complexity. In summary, this is a well (not highly), polished machine, but man, it is one hell of a machine."
1609943304,"The game gave me the same feeling I had when I was a kid. Cyberpunk 2077 has an immersive world, dark atmosphere and great characters! I enjoy the game a lot. Yes, I faced a few bugs but there were not critical to my playthrough."
1609942908,"Great Game. 
Good Graphics.
Scary amount of Glitches.
A lot of Talking.
Game is difficult in some ways."
1609942877,If I want your opinion I'll fuck it!
1609942877,This game is great very good story but a big issue is the bugs but set that aside once the issues are fixed this is a game worth playing!
1609942858,great game if you can overlook the bugs.
1609942749,"This game is BORING AF. I should have requested a refund instead of going past the 2hr mark and hoping it would get better (it doesn't get any better). The missions and itemization are a chore and not compelling in any way, feels like a painful series of fetch/talk quests. The graphics are disappointing even with my 2080Ti turned all the way up. I'm at the 13hr mark and have zero motivation to continue this. Tried getting a refund but I'm past the allowance criteria so the best I can do now is uninstall it to create space for (anything) better."
1609942655,the bugs are more funny than annoying no regrets buing this game
1609942646,Amazing and cool
1609942578,"I was worried when the release date was pushed. I was worried when All I read were articles about CDPR being sued. I was worried about graphical glitches and game play glitches. After investing about 130 hours in I can safely say that as a member of ""PC Master Race"" the game is awesome. From launch day there were a couple glitches. Nothing that broke the game entirely, nothing that made me want to shut it off and never play again. It has been years since I had a game fully consume all of my free time and make me want to do more...more...MORE.  The storylines are good.  The sheer amount of content gives off that ""cyber-skyrim"" feel.  The graphics are beautiful.  Now, I am not gaming at 4k, so I cannot weigh in on that. But at 1920x1080@120hz I had all settings including RTX set to the highest levels.  My RTX2070 Super chewed through it like nothing; which made the immersion into this world all the better.  I do not review many games but because of the large amount of negative publicity I thought it only right to let people know that this game is AWESOME. Play it, you won't be sorry."
1609942570,.0
1609942310,"I wouldn't recommend buying this game in the state that it's in now. The story is far too short and the side quest's are uninteresting. The ""revolutionary"" Ai are really terrible, the Ai from Gta 3 that was released in 2001 are far better and act way more realistically. I'm not sure who thought that it was a good idea to make the police literally spawn behind you the second you commit a crime but it's really annoying. And they didn't even bother to program police car chases. If you commit a crime you just drive away for 10 seconds and you have lost them and that's it. The driving in the game is also not very good. Car steering feels very spongey, the brakes are poor even on high end cars, and the mini map is SO zoomed in that I miss every second corner. I will say that the game has a lot of potential, it was just released way too early."
1609942255,"Well what can i say about this game? After 8 years, a few trailers, 37 hours, a good story, and tons of missions later i have to say that this is a really good game. Yes the game has a few bugs, but you know what? I don't give a f++k about those bugs but i do hope that the developers will fix those, but until then I HAVE A CITY TO BURN."

1609942082,"Does not live up to expectations, but it was still fun. Wait for a sale to buy or have it gifted to you, not worth 60 bucks."
1609942030,"Pros: Keanu Reeves, Graphically beautiful and can challenge your high end graphics card, some of the music, and some characters you want to spend time with.
Cons: Wasted opportunity with many characters. Wasted opportunity with a lot of things actually. Honestly, the issues with this game such as the police, dumb AI, bugs that require reloading to a previous point, etc.. are all well documented. I can't believe I wasted $60 on this game. I went through and did every possible story and quest that I could find to get my moneys worth. Looking back, I simply wasted a lot of time I should have spent on AC vallhalla, or better yet, going to the gym and doing laundry. CDPR fooled most of us on this one"
1609941749,full of entertaining bugs and a good story 7.4/10
1609941461,"Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that I haven’t quite been looking forward to reviewing. I have such a huge love/hate relationship with this game that constantly alters my opinion on what I’ve experienced every other day. 

On the one hand, you have a gorgeous looking story driven game telling an interesting and memorable story that is driven by its brilliant cast of characters, and on the other hand you have an “action & adventure” game that can feel so dull and monotonous to play, which is brought even lower by the onslaught of bugs. So yeah, Cyberpunk 2077 is pretty interesting.  

[h1]In Night City, looks are everything...[/h1]

CDPR have a funny idea of telling the truth, but one thing that they weren’t lying about for sure is just how beautiful the city looks. They went all out when it came to making a city that had the ability to make you go “wow” around almost every corner. 

The city has a design that feels both familiar and futuristic. You have massive skyscrapers covered in holographic adverts to worn down slums and suburbs to culturally influenced locations such as China and Japan town. Each district of Night City has character. The scale of some of the districts is immense, and quite unlike anything I’ve seen in a game. Right from the get-go you can see just how much work went into making this city. There is a huge attention to detail all over the map. The more linear sections of the game world hold up just as well. 

The game stays true to the idea that looks are everything. In doing so however, the game world lacks a seriously important element; life. Night City is truly a dead place to live in. So much work has been put into making the game world look good and not nearly enough time into making it feel alive. Player interaction with the world is miniscule, and as a result, travelling from one mission to another makes the city feel like a glorified loading screen.

This is further damaged by the abundance of bugs. The AI is laughable at best. NPCs don’t have any realistic paths to follow and will sometimes just walk in circles. As for traffic, cars will stop in the middle of the road for no reason. Hell, sometimes the cars just disappear when you look away. While these bugs are funny at first, they start to hamper your immersion in the game world. It’s sad to say that Night City is all looks and no substance.

[h1]We have a city to burn…[/h1]

Cyberpunk 2077 follows protagonist V as they journey to Night City with the ambition of becoming a legend. However, after a job goes horribly wrong and a string of events unfold, the story becomes one of survival.

Along the way you meet a variety of interesting and brilliantly voice acted characters, each with their own personality and backstories. If I were to pick a favourite aspect of Cyberpunk 2077, it would definitely be the characters. They were the driving force of this game for me and they really helped carry the narrative. Even Keanu Reeves’ character was superb.

The story itself is really good too. While I do think it takes a while to get there, by the end of act 1 it really picks up. The pacing of act 2 and 3 are fine, and I was more than satisfied with the ending I got. Side quests are a mixed bag, but the ones involving characters you meet throughout the story are well worth the investment. Dialogue options allow for a variety of outcomes to happen in some situations, and the writing as a whole is fantastic.

Most of the narrative’s shortcomings appear in the first act. If you watched the trailers, you may have heard about the lifepaths. Three different backgrounds that are supposed to have an impact on what kind of person V is. Well… they don’t. What you get is a 20-minute prologue that feels like cut content and has no impact throughout the game. After that you are thrown into the city to be a mercenary, no matter which lifepath you pick. The only differing factor is you may sometimes get one extra dialogue option based on your lifepath.

Another problem I have with the narrative is how it skips V’s introduction into the city. You get a cutscene that is a time lapse of V arriving in the city, meeting crime bosses and doing big things. Then when you actually play in Night City you are always being contacted by people your character knows, but you as the player do not. It’s quite jarring, and although you get used to it, it’s a shame you can’t experience all of that for yourself.

[h1]Wreaking Havoc in Night City…[/h1]

The gameplay is where the lackluster elements of Cyberpunk 2077 really become noticeable. In short, most aspects of the gameplay either felt rushed, unfinished, or incredibly mediocre. Let’s start with the combat.

The combat can be split into three categories: guns, hacking and melee. My opinion on the gun play varied depending on what type of gun I was using. I typically found the pistols and assault rifles to be rather tame, whereas shotguns and sniper rifles had a much better feel to them. Most weapons you find can be modified and upgraded to improve their strength and effectiveness.     

The hacking is a bit of a mixed bag. I usually used hacking when in stealth related situations. Stealth in this game… It’s there, but hacking makes it much more memorable, and you can unlock more hacks as you find new equipment. I found the interface for hacking to be quite clunky and because of that I rarely used it outside of stealth. 

The melee combat is strange because sometimes it can be really good and other times it can be really bad. Sometimes it feels like you’re hitting a wall instead of a person. That being said, throwing a grenade at enemies and then charging in with a katana never gets old. 

The main thing that lets the combat down is the poor AI. It is really bad. Enemies are really stupid and will sometimes just stand in the open wanting to be shot. It doesn’t help that enemies are usually bullet spongey which results in combat sequences feeling dragged.

The more I played Cyberpunk however, the more the combat experience improved, and this is thanks to the game’s skill system. As you level up you acquire skill points that can be invested in different areas such as pistols, body strength, hacking, stealth and many more. The game offers you complete freedom in how you want your gameplay experience to evolve, and while the skill system is a bit messy to look at, it does have a positive influence on the combat.

I’ll finish off this section by saying that Cyberpunk’s gameplay is far from the worst. If I didn’t enjoy it to some degree I would’ve stopped playing. My problem with it is that it just doesn’t go far enough to impress. There are definitely moments where the intensity is raised and the gameplay feels great. But the majority of the gameplay felt slogged and repetitive. Bullet sponge enemies with dumb AI only make that experience worse. 

[h1]My Final Thoughts[/h1]

Cyberpunk 2077 had a lot of work put into it and that is clear right from the start. The game boasts a beautiful world with immense scale, and has some of the best cast of characters I’ve seen in a long time, and with a cracking story to go along with it, it’s an incredible success in the writing department.

As far as everything else goes, - the gameplay, the technical issues, the lack of finalisation in some areas - It's a disappointment. Giving the game extra time to fix bugs won't fix some of the fundamental issues. While I do recommend this game, I would wait for the bugs to be fixed, then buy it on sale.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
-Really good main story
-Some of the best characters I’ve seen in a game
-Breath-taking city design with impressive scale
-Decent gun play
-Good skill progression

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
-Feels unfinished in many areas
-Way too many bugs to be acceptable
-Mediocre combat and bad AI
-Lack of interaction and life in the city
-Life paths are disappointing

[h1]Final Ratings:[/h1]

1609941436,"This game is simply just terrible, some 10 years older games have better graphics, the story is just meh... you cant really change anything in the storyline, and the menu system is very unpleasant... theres more, but i dont really give a shit about typing it all down"
1609941295,The game has some bugs but nothing that won't be fixed in the future. It has a good story and pretty fun gunplay. Lack luster in some areas where you'd think there would be more. I put in enough hours to get my money's worth
1609940726,Best game ever
1609940695,unbalanced boring
1609940480,"Wait for the balancing and potato fixes. if they don't fix this game then I recommend you wait for an offer.
The story is good, some of the optional story elements are also good. Other than the metric shit ton of bugs the other downfall is this game is far too easy and exploitable."
1609940463,Flawed game but i really enjoyed my time in Night city and doing all story-related stuff.
1609940447,"Yes the glitches are a bummer. But that doesn't demean the development that was put into this game. Real sold effort ! But yes for a 8 year development cycle the game could have been even more stable but I guess we can all blame covid-19 and the excessive crunches that led to this. Me being a developer myself, I know how frustrating and demoralizing it can be on one's quality of work.

Keanu Reeves definitely impresses !!! He keeps you engaged with his rockerboy sass. The story unraveling is brilliant. Little skeptical about the ending. I do hope there will be a sequel to this that addresses that ! 

The UI team for their visualization of NC deserves a standing applause. 

After a long time I saw several interesting characters (apart from Johnny) in the game. Meaning it made me care about them. I get how this game is already big. But the branching storylines could have been even more ""branching"" for those other NPCs if that makes any sense. Because as of now even if it appears to be branching I feel constricted to a particular ending."
1609940273,"After patch 1.06 there aren't that many bugs, at least not of the game breaking variety. Overall it's a pretty damn good game on PC.... I just pretend some visual glitches are a part of the story since it makes sense lol."
1609940212,"NO SPOILERS! :)

I am 38, have been a PC Gamer for about 25 years and have never written a review for a game before.
Cyberpunk 2077 is one of, if not THE BEST game, I have ever had the chance to play. 

If you love a story driven rpg-adventure, with an organic, deep narative and lovable characters, this game is for you! PERIOD.

Sure, there are a few graphic glitches like floating ashtrays, physics that behave strangely at times, charaters that pop up out of nowhere and dead people with half a face that keep yelling at you, but all this did not diminish my overall experience that I was LIVING in this absolute masterpiece of a game.

The story gripped me from the very beginning and kept its high pace until the very end... I can't remember the last time I was sad that a game is over.

At any time you feel that there are TONS of things you can and WANT to do apart from just following the main story line: 
Pick up one of the perfectly scripted side quests, upgrade your gear, help out the police by taking out a nearby gang... Every activity feels rewarding and impactful as you level up your skilltrees and specialize in the areas of your choice.

Maybe the best part is that you can really play the game the way you want to, without feeling you are missing out in any major way. Can't find a solution to a problem because you are lacking the technical ability or language skills? No problem, there might be another path that you can brute force your way into.

Will definitely replay the game in a completely different way to see at least one more alternate ending!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
1609940136,"Yes, the game is glitchy and no, this game will not run well on most systems, but WOW is this game gorgeous. The visuals are absolutely stunning and they proof that ray-tracing isn't a gimmick or a fad. While the story isn't as RPG-like as most would want, it still pulls you in and gives you enough choices that actually do affect the story, instead of just changing dialogue options. While I can think of several ways this game could be improved through updates, it is still well above ""just barely playable"" and I do not regret purchasing it."
1609944188,"Cyberpunk 2077 was one of those games that I knew literally nothing about until friends told me about it a few months prior to its original release date. I took a look at it and I wasn’t sure what to think about it, but I was willing to give it a try. So I wasn’t really hyped for the game and didn’t have super high expectations. Anyway, after spending about 65 hours on my first playthrough (-5 hours I spent in the menu being AFK) I think it’s time for a review. 

[h1]The Good[/h1]
Once again did CDPR a great job at story-telling. The dialogues are well-written and so are the characters. I expected nothing less from CDPR in that regard. I found most of the more fleshed out characters you meet to be interesting to interact with. Night City itself is absolutely stunning and looking outside of my apartment window after opening the shutter for the first time was absolutely breathtaking. The visuals of the city and the outlying badlands are beautiful and it really delivers on that dystopian cyberpunk atmosphere. The city itself is clustered with aggressive neon lighting, obnoxious ads and has a generally futuristic look. The game offers a lot of variety when it comes to weapons, you have a multitude of different pistols, revolvers, machine guns, shotguns, snipers and also melee weapons to choose from. The world is full with quests and contracts but only very few of them have actual storylines and interesting characters that you care for. Also, the photo mode is hilarious and gives you the opportunity to take many funny but also visually stunning photos that look almost like they were taken out of a movie. You also have a couple of romance options for different genders and sexuality and I guess that’s good.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
The main story is way shorter in comparison to The Witcher 3’s story so I was completely dumbstruck when it showed me the message that I could not complete any other quests from this point on until I ended the main quest. Besides that, I also didn’t like the main questline beyond the Arasaka robbery. I found it to be very underwhelming in contrast to the cyberpunk setting. The different life paths you can choose from at the beginning (Nomad, Street Kid and Corpo) have barely any meaning going forward into the story, all they do is give you a different intro and a few extra dialogue options that don’t mean anything. Although the income gap between the poor and the rich in a setting like this should be greater than ever, everybody seems to be able to get cyberware implants although it is extremely expensive and costs sometimes more than a new car. You could argue that these implants vary in quality, but I couldn’t tell from it’s visual appearance. The story and dialogue also focuses way too much on the technical stuff which is often boring to listen to. Navigating the map is a nightmare as it’s like if a Ubisoft employee vomited all over it. There are just way too many markers on the map for every little activity.

[h1]The Ugly[/h1]
The AI is the dumbest I’ve seen in a very long time from a triple A game. In fact the NPCs are so stupid, bland, clueless and repetitive, that they remind me of the matrix/simulation episode from Rick and Morty (it’s called [i]M. Night Shaym-Aliens![/i]). Just as in The Witcher 3, the ability to talk to every NPC walking the streets shouldn’t be available as they don’t add anything of value to the game. Besides spending so much time in character creation, you never get to see your character again while playing the game besides taking a look in the mirror every now and then and in a cutscene at the end of the main quest. The game is way too often a “Press F to continue”-Simulator instead of just giving you a cutscene. You often look like a dumb fool anyway as you often don’t really dress your character after style, but rather how much armor the clothings have. You can’t customize your character - or anything else for that matter - beyond the character creation anyway. There are no barbers, no tattoo shops andthere’s also no car customization, you can't customize your apartment or buy a new one. Night City - no matter how great it looks - is dead and bland. The city is nothing more but noise in between quests. You can’t sit down at the many restaurants, food stands or bars of the game and eat or drink something, you can’t even sit down on a bench and just enjoy the view, there are no activities to do in your free time, no mini games, just nothing. They also rely way too much on sex to emphasize that this is a dystopian world where everybody is reduced to being sex-hungry, inhumane, tech-infested consumerists. The games pacing is way off as it tries to be this action-adventure, looter shooter while also throwing these extremely long dialogue sections at you. The roleplay in this RPG is extremely lacking, in fact barely there at all, you’re V. V is a mercenary. No matter your previous life path choice, you are a mercenary. You cannot join factions and define your path in any way as it falls victim to the main quest anyway. There is no possibility to side with any of the factions available in the game and a reputation system is also not available, which eliminates all consequences for your actions against any faction. Driving in the game isn't that great and the minimap is way too zoomed in, so you miss like every second turn because you can't see where you have to go any further but 10 metres. 

[h1]In Conclusion[/h1]
The game is extremely disappointing, especially considering the many promises the marketing department of CDPR made prior to the games release. Beside the main quest and the very few interesting side quests I mostly felt like a kid in a huge playground. It was like a lucid dream where you’re aware that you’re dreaming and everything around you makes no sense. The NPCs and their stupidity were a constant reminder that I’m just playing a game. At no point did I feel like this was an actual living and breathing world where I would imagine the people surrounding me having lives of their own - because they don’t. At the time of writing this review the game also suffers due to the many bugs and glitches that also add to ruin the experience.

I had some enjoyable moments where I’d think: “Yeah, yeah this is amazing.” But most of the time it was more like: “eh. wtf is happening.” I will probably play the game again in a couple of months, after the majority of bugs have been ironed out and the first free DLCs roll in, but the main problems of the game are not bugs or a handful of missing features that could be implemented like the barber, but rather major design choices that I can’t get comfortable with. I don’t hate the game, but I don’t like it either. I’m mostly just disappointed.

So no, I wouldn’t recommend Cyberpunk 2077."

1609969531,"I am very picky about games. I dislike 1st person shooters immensely. I was insanely skeptical about this game. Once I finally bit the bullet and bought it, I couldn't launch it. My mind reverted back to all the terrible reviews, and my finger was on the refund button.

Turned out I had the wrong drivers installed. It also turns out that most people in the discussions are trolls seeking attention. The type of clowns that I prefer to avoid in real life and on forums. Gated community kids.... Crusaders...

If I had listened to the discussions I would have missed out on possibly the best rpg I have ever played. The story is touching and very well acted. I even enjoyed the gunfights and I hate shooters. Play it on easy if you want people to drop in a few shots like rl. The melee is cool too. I prefer non lethal batons. 

The driving is very well done. The city is just huge... People say there is not enough context in regards to the lore. Well it would take about 20 hours just to read all of the lore I unlocked just on my first playthrough. So ya...Go outside or something. Take your anger out somewhere else. 

This game is Deus Ex combined with GTA 5 combined with the Witcher. It's absolutely amazing to me. I am not often surprised, but I was with this game. I expected way more bugs than I got. "

1609938332,"overrated peace of shit that fails in every way. as a shooter: shitty doom with bullet sponge enemies, when u try to strafe to any side u just dash. as an open world game: lol just do millions of stupid ahaha funny side quests and clear certain areas filled with enemies. as a role playing game: nothing u do matters and any line u choose in dialogue option is basically yes or no or just few ways to say the same thing. optimization is horrible. im sure they wont fix it soon cuz they already obsessed with new free dlc. wow instead of fixing their disasterpeace they're just trying to attract new players."
1609938268,You can beat the shit out of people with a vibrating dildo.
1609938242,"Frankly  find all of the negative comments about the game unrealistic. Is the game perfect, no, but its not the heap of trash people make it out to be either. Its a good AAA game I would recommend to everyone."
1609937895,"Do I recommend this game? Yes.
Has it met my expectations? No.

There was time I would have given my hand for the CDP, and guess what? <insert photo of silverhand>
But despite this I had a lot of fun, it is worth the price and despite the lack of the promised elements, it still captivates. Though they certainly failed by deliberately lying, I totally don't understand the size of hate poured out on this game.


Pros and cons
+++++The graphics.
+++The uniqueness of city and gangs.
+++ Incredibly lively main characters in the game
++ You sink into the world, you think about problems shown, you feel the reality of the feelings experienced by the characters. (or maybe just i do)
++++/--The plot is really good, although you can see cut areas from the script (I suspect its for Keanu so he could play a bigger role in the game)
++Character development is extremely rewarding.
+The city's problems are alive, and the plot for me really resembles a vision of the future, not like most SciFi movies which are remote from reality
+I like driving cars, although many say that it is not realistic. Also their sounds are pure poetry.
+cool fixer theme in the game world
+Panam ass :v 
+Cool feature of bullets piercing walls


---The city feels it is empty, little interaction with random characters, little surprise events, few shops, no buying apartamets, no mini-games few gags (almost none  compared to the witcher)
--- Cops and crowd stupid Ai and the promised but not existing pursuit system(;_;)
---The choices only appear to have an impact on the gameplay (many times it doesn't matter what you choose)
- No body and hairstyle modifications after character creator (really which year it is??)
- No car color modification (ffs some of cars have many fine colors but this one you could buy have to be ugly...) 
- Despite the great variety of gangs, this is practically the end of their pluses. Gangs do not react to you killing them all around in any way. There are no gang fight quests that I expected, or missions to help them spread throughout the city. A roughly beautiful shell, the only sensible interaction is for the main story missions. Besides, they are like that to shot them in the face.
- Plot holes (like i said before im sure the did cut on script in some moment and they left a lot of clues for it, e.g. talking about Santiago with Saul totally unable to know who he even is)
-The map is unreadable and the GPS goes crazy sometimes
-The quest from non-main plot and side quests of the main characters, are practically all the same.
-The manufacturing system need mass production feature otherwise it's disgustingly time consuming"
1609937741,"Welcome to Bugsville - still enjoyed it either way,"
1609937512,"Unoptimized,on high and low graphics fps is same,no increases,cant get refund cause i have 4.1 hours,i suggest no1 buys this at this stage"
1609937024,"One small step for bugs, one giant leap for gamekind"
1609936487,"6/10 
story is okay, the game play is entertaining enough until you hit one of the many game breaking bugs that blocks progression, 
"
1609936451,"under the bugs this game is great. deep story telling, lots of side missions to do and acting and characters that get you invested. however there are bugs and some of them are very immersion destroying. for instance whenever i get a cutscene, things tend to clip through other things, or not display right. this made any romantic scenes funny and freaky, and totally broke immersion. some of the sadder scenes had this issue too. i would still recommend this game though. 7.5-10. would be higher with less bugs"
1609936382,"With bugs and all, its awesome"
1609936127,"This game feels like GTA mixed with Fallout 3. The game is Open World first, an RPG second, and a Shooter third. There are bugs, but so far (30+ hours), they haven't been game breaking. Some bugs are even enjoyable and feel like Skyrim bugs, you know, comical. I am really enjoying it on my 1080ti, but I've seen similarly beautiful games with lesser powered hardware, i.e. Deathstranding on PS4 pro. I would recommend this game for anyone with at least a mid range pc."
1609936001,本当に良いゲームuはそれを試してみるべきです
1609935568,a good game
1609935455,Main Story and Character Interactions are Amazing. The deeper you go with the side content the more bugs you find. It shows the shallow side of the game. Def Worth it for a Single Player Narrative Play through!
1609935410,.
1609935002,"The game could be really good, but it needs a powerful computer to even run without it becoming a PowerPoint presentation.
It has more bugs than the bug wilderness around my house in a 1km radius.
Maybe the devs will fix it or it will be the most overhyped game and ripoff of 2020."
1609934841,"This game is amazing, love the story and haven't run into an bugs either so its been a good experience all around :D"
1609934812,"This game is simultaneously the worst and the best of triple a game. it is a buggy mess  but might be the best game of this year . it has piles of shit quest and random clear out objectives which is frustating when you consider that there is alot of amazing side quest that people may never play cause the ""side quest"" and actuall quest appear the same on the map.  

Cyberpunk has one of the best looking maps in any video game only problem is there is nothing to do. but that is frustating considering  cyberpunk is a compitent game but its missing the little stuff only problem is it missing alot of the little stuff to add flavour . 

But to be honest my opinions are only from a small amount of game time ."
1609935452,"If you have the tec to play it now, go for it, if not wait another 6 months for them to pach things up and optimize. If mod support is good this game will become the next Skyrim as far as mod possibilities go.

In its current state I'd say it's a standard AAA 6-7/10 game, like all major releases in the past years bugs up the wall and under the carpet until version 1.1 or even 1.2 comes around.

The cinematics and interactions you have with the npcs, feels really immersive and is truly how future rpgs should be like.

The main story can be finished in like 30-40 ish hours, but honestly i'd say the side quests are worth doing more than  it. 

Romance depending on your sexual preference and body/voice type is limited to only 1 ""choice"". The body type determines  what  2 options you have. [insert futanari are discriminated jk here ]

Economy is broken, some things cost an arm and a leg that aren't actualy worth it and others that are op af are cheaper than a bag of chips. 

Crafting needs an overhaul coz suffers even more than the economy.

Police... for the love of god don't get on the bad side of the law if you don't want to live the experience the Matrix films tried to imply when fighting the agents. Police will spawn 5 meters away from you the moment you dare hurt a civilian and if you got the stones to hurt an agent? well then they send in the T100 and the augmented troops that will 1 shot you unless you used the gliched crafting system to have 6000+ armor and last 5 shots.

Stats aren't realy explained and tbh also are in need to some looking at.

It would seem like there are more negatives than positives here, but tbh these things will most likely be fixed in a few months and are minor inconveniences for the overall experience. 
If you can't wait, buy it now and have a reason to replay it after they patch it up or wait until 1.2 is launched."
1609934339,yis
1609934291," I could not stop playing it.  Its hard for a game to keep my attention and this one does.
Pros: graphics and scenery, LOTS of Missions and on my rig it works fairly well.  
Cons: Game does have a few bugs, but not enough to make the game less enjoyable."
1609934218,"fun time? yes! 
Main story is about 20 hours, and yes, its been rushed. 
Finish everything took me about 40-50 hours. Game only crushed once or twice, but tons of bugs.
If you have not heard about the game, you will have fun in the game, beside all the bugs that is.
but if you come with any expectation, I would wait until the game is patched, and missing features been added.

I do not see how CDPR can fix the rushed main story line, so, not recommend.

1609934163,tooo much bug

1609933907,Excellent!
1609933594,"This is a good shooter game BUT not the Cyberpunk RPG we been promised. Bugs can be fixed unlike Linear gameplay, no consequences of your choices(because THERE ARE NO CHOICES). 
Most important issue for me: game is not involving, I played it for one week and doesn't have desire to play it more, it feels empty, unfinished. People play this game and post positive revies only because of HYPE around it!
FOR me this game is DISAPPOINTMENT"
1609933388,game is very unpolished but if you want a really amazing dystopian world to explore then this game is for u
1609933380,"Not a bad game, but can't keep up with Witcher 3. Also it got alot of bugs. Still playable but sometime these bugs are really annoying.
I still would not recommend to buy this game, atleast not at this price. 
I think i wasted my money on this. But  i am mostly comparing this game to the witcher series, so i am quite biased."
1609933308,game has some bugs but they are not enough to take away from the brilliant story pacing and gameplay that cyberpunk 2077 has to offer
1609933195,"""Coming when it's ready"" It WASN'T ready. And it still isn't.
Marketing : ""An RPG where your decisions will have impact on the world and story."" Absolute lie. The story is linear. Only one choice actually matter, the one that decides which ending you get. Story was obviously rewritten to fit Keanu late in development (see 2018 gameplay demo and opening montage with Jackie).
""Cyberpunk is about style"". Your character looks like shit the whole game thanks to the bad loot system, can't change basic stuff like hair style, etc. after character creation. Can't add cyberware that changes appearance.
Since the loot system is bad, you spend way too much time cleaning up inventory, the terrible UI doesn't help.
The AI is trash. The game physics is trash.
Shooting feels alright. 
Melee with blade is alright except when you get stuck in a glory kill animation and you get shot by everybody else. 
Melee hand to hand is complete trash, as is the driving (for keyboard and controller).
Keybinding is a joke without mods.
And the list goes on.
Do I even need to mention the bugs?

Game is carried by the setting, the presentation ( music and art direction ) and the good writting (main quest and named side quests).

Don't buy. Wait for complete edition at least, or better yet wait for Cyberpunk 3."
1609933062,"I'd recommend this game.....in about a year or two. 

No amount of optimizing will help you play this game as of right now. Putting this on hold till CD Projekt RED puts out the dumpster fire."
1609933046,"Thank God I am finished now I can uninstall this garbage and play something else. The first playthrough is ... entertaining. The subsequent playthroughs were ...tedious is putting it mildly. Aside from a well written story this game is an illusion and with so many bugs, glitches and missing features that illusion gets shattered rather quickly. Not at all worth $60! As long as you stick to the main story and a couple of the high profile side jobs it is sorta fun. But in the end everything you work and grind for is for absolutely nothing. There is no real endgame. No new jobs spawn. No new assaults or crimes in progress to take on. There really isn't anything engaging left to do except run back and forth on the Pacifica Beach killing rando gangbangers. AI is basically non existent. And there really is no need to go for all the goodies because you don't need them and they really don't serve a purpose after you beat it. Maybe in a couple of years they will have it polished but for now you are only getting about 20-40 hours of play before there is nothing left but an empty map. Wait for a sale....A DEEPLY DISCOUNTED SALE!!! THIS WAS A $20 game at best."

1609927583,"fucking lies, Kunts"
1609927550,"TLDR: Great gameplay. Good story. Funny bugs. Requires beefy PC.

A lot of people complain about bugs but I haven't personally encountered many. The ones I have encountered have just been funny, like: Accidentally calling for two vehicles and they spawn inside of each other and explode, or killing a man and seeing him turn into a sacked lunch. I did have Jackie turn invisible during a cutscene once as well.

Gameplay is really fun. Lots of weapon options and variety of skill trees give you plenty of different playstyles.

The story is also very interesting and enjoyable. The characters that you meet are unique in their own ways and lots of them have side missions/stories that you can follow. There are a lot of generic missions you can do as well for cash, exp, etc. There are also several endings you can get depending on your choices you make in the game, so that's always cool.

I do have a few critiques. I wish there was a vehicle customization option. You can get a lot of different cars but there isn't any way to change how they look in detail. The main issue though is that, while you get to choose your background and there are dialogue options based off of that, your character is pretty much always the same person. You don't really get to be who you want to be like in other RPGs. Wasn't a big deal to me but I know others are upset by it.

Overall, the game is worth buying, as long as you have a solid PC. I'm running a 1070 Ti and a Ryzen 3600X and I get about 50 frames on 1440p Medium or 1080p High. It's the new Crysis in terms of PC Killers.

"
1609927216,"2077 can look beautiful but while a few of the missions and characters show some promise, overall the writing is uncompelling and builds up to climaxes that feel mundane. 

Between the very poor AI and generally empty world (bar the countless ""defeat these 5 generic enemies for no reason"" encounters), the open world is quick to reveal itself as a facade for an otherwise linear game with little between missions to stumble upon to make your experience feel unique. 

The mechanics are passable but dont give rise to any gameplay enjoyable enough to be worth putting up with the bugs and general lack of polish. Weapons with built in auto aim or literal wall hacks dont exactly inspire fun while very poor and basic RPG character building elements punish more active gameplay. 

The final mission is basically a single dialogue option as to which of the 3 main endings you would like to play (only slightly better done than Mass Effect 3's choice), but thankfully CD Projekt Red gives you the option to just shoot yourself there and then, saving you the chore of having to play through the final dull mission and skipping straight to the astonishing long credit roll of all the people involved in creating this disappointment.

~90 hours of time in game and 95% of content completed"
1609927139,"Bought the game after finished the game with my daughter's copy, I think that's saying something... 

and get a ray tracing video card already, Jensen was right all along lol."

1609925940,if you played any games on launch and were buggy messes then don't fear the game will get better over time just like skyrim and the witcher trilogy. watch videos and then make your choice
1609925817,"The game is buggy as fuck; however, the bugs make the game so much more enjoyable. I hope to see more content in this game"
1609925745,"Cyberpunk 2077 release has been delayed 3 times and when it came it didn't look like it was a final product. Driving model is bad. NPCs are bugging. One boss fight that was meant to be challenging, was easy because the boss got stuck in the wall. Phonecalls from random people are annoying.

BUT!

The story and storytelling is great. Characters have real personalities. You really feel like this game was made by CDPR - story and quests are the main points of this game. Night City looks beatiful, especially at night. When I was watching pre-release trailers and gameplays I was worried about shooting model, but I think it's ok for an RPG.

Is that a good game? Yes. Did I enjoy it? Yes. I think it will be very good when CDPR fixes all the bugs and maybe adjusts some things like driving.

4/5 in its current state, I will play this game again when it's fully patched."
1609925595,glitch funny hehe
1609925587,Based
1609925575,starting to become playable
1609925250,"Way too many bugs as is. 

Really wanted this game to be all it was hyped up to be, but right now that is so far from what we really got. My biggest complaint is all the little things, i.e, not being able to pick up quest items cause it's bugged or climbing a wall just to insta-flatline for no apparent reason. 

The story is meh, not bad, but not good, especially for the supposed time put into this game. The game itself looks beautiful, but the mechanics feel horrible and squared. (think back to Halo 1 controls) Especially melee combat.

The game tutorials leaves A LOT to be desired and has no clear description for how most of the mechanics in the game work other than one paragraph blocks that seem more redundantly vague then helpful. 

The game honestly feels like it has been pushed out only half finished.

I really hope this game's bugs get buffed out in a hotfix soon, but regardless my overall opinion of this game is it is definitely NOT worth the $60.00 price tag."
1609925047,It's good.
1609924802,Not perfect but worth the buy
1609924722,"nowhere near all the hype, works perfectly and looks great, but hollow, nowhere near as immersive as the pre-launch leads you to believe. Even the life path choices barely differ in the game."
1609924067,buggy but really fun
1609924029,"The most heavily marketed early access game of all time. First two hours was good for me but after that part feels incomplete. World is incomplete and unnatural. Obviously there is cut content. Too much content has been scrapped. Main story is pretty short. I thought I'd play the game three times with all life paths but they are all the same, waste of time. I played on 2080 super but still had performance issues. Rumors say that devs are planning of a No Man's Sky style comeback due to late June. Even if it's not real, CDPR lied hard to their customers. I hope we will see a better game after 1 or 2 year."
1609923888,"Love the game one of my all time favorites now truth be told i've only run into a few glitches but nothing nearly game breaking bethesda games come out more broken and don't get as much shit as this game did 

Glitches i ran into:

- Occasional person standing in T position (laughed)
- tripped on a can some how wanted level activated and i got jumped by the police (laughed so fucking hard at this)

just know this game is amazing and you will have a good time if you are into RPG's"
1609923725,"Disregarding all of the glitches this game is still only okay. The biggest issue is the AI and the immersiveness of the city. These were two really big selling points of the game and they are far below average for a modern AAA title. No police chases, no interaction with pedestrians, poor enemy AI, and no random interactions at all whatsoever. The second issue that I have with this game is how short the main mission line is. I honestly thought that I was about 1/3 of the way through the main missions when I got the message that I was at the point of no return. This game is maybe 1/3 of the Witcher 3 in terms of the main quest line. Finally, customization, crafting, and talent points are next to useless. I really didn't feel much satisfaction or the need to spend any time trying to improve V. The gear is lackluster, the crafting is useless, and the game never became difficult enough, even on the hardest setting, that I felt the need to improve my stats. The side quests are good. They are often more complex and involving that you may expect. Other than that, it boggles my mind that CDPR spent 8 years on this thing. Unfortunately, I think Cyberpunk is the beginning of the end for this dev. At least the Witcher 3 was good."
1609923485,"Like in love, you must forgive them for the bad things. I love them so ... we must wait a bit more for the game to be perfect. For others It will be forever ruined, haters will hate and fans will wait a bit more for the hotfixes and DLC to come. I can only review this by my experience on PC. Running great on my PC, had only 5 ""big"" bugs in over 200h. Now I'm playing the story for the second time. But there was nothing a ""load game"" and ""restart the game"" could repair. Yes there was a big Hype around the game, yes expectations where big, but you must remember it is CDPR so fixes and DLC will come and the game will look much better."
1609923406,gg
1609923318,"A bit buggy, and maybe it didn't live up to some people's sky high expectations, but this is a great game. Fun gameplay loops, awesome setting, compelling story, good gunplay, fun cyborg shenanigans, and characters that make you want to playthrough again just to hang out with them. If you liked the witcher 3, you'll probably like this even if sci fy isn't usually your thing. Especially after a few patches to smooth out performance and fill in the world even better, this will likely be one of my favorite games of all time."
1609923210,GOOD
1609923156,"Just got one single graphic glitch. Nothing else. The rest, if you played Witcher 3, then you know what you will get--
1. Amazing characters
2. Great Storyline
3. Beautiful Graphics
4. Great Endings
In addition, combat is amazing."
1609923148,"Love the game! Spent many hours just walking around enjoying the scenery. Visuals are godly, story is interesting and characters you meet along the way will get you invested. 

However:
-Very demanding on hardware. If you do not have a high end PC, I would wait. 
-Many bugs and glitches. If things like seeing a floating hamburger during dialog ruin your immersion, I would wait."
1610009498,"First off, yes this game was released before it was ready and there are a LOT of bugs. I still managed to complete the main campaign despite this but I did so with a ridiculous bug that caused me to be naked (with no genitals) from the waist down for the entire ending section of the campaign, despite apparently having clothing equipped.  

This is where I found my biggest disappointment with this game; the bugs took me out of the immersion of the experience and having to complete a large portion of the main campaign half naked was ridiculous. 

Overall the story and game world are amazing though but again due to the unfinished state some aspects of the story were a bit broken or felt unfinished. 

The graphics are obviously amazing and with Ray Tracing enabled it really looks stunning. That being said, I played with RT off as the hit on my FPS with it on didn't justify using it and the game still looks great without RT. I don't think any current gen graphics card can truly run this game maxed out at playable frame rates, so you will need to play around with settings to get decent performance. 

Overall I really enjoyed the gun play in particular, though I did like how you can progress your character with upgrades it didn't feel like this had much impact on the overall outcome. I can understand those who had expectations of something deeper than Deus X feeling disappointed but I had no expectations beyond a lot of bugs. You can approach missions with stealth and hacking or brute force but due to the flaky stealth system I found myself resorting to shooting my way through objectives - which I enjoy anyway but others may find this disappointing. There doesn't seem to be any benefit to using stealth either and I must say that early on I didn't bother upgrading my character or spending skill points and it didn't seem to hinder me too much. 

In summary, this game could have been released as one of the all time greats. We know CDPR can produce quality and if you haven't tried Witcher 3 I would probably hold off on this for a few months and play Witcher 3 now, since that game is complete and not full of bugs. 

Its a crying shame this game was released in an unready state, it deserved so much better as the scope and potential of what they did here is still impressive. 

I recommend it, though I would wait for a few months of bug fixes and patches"
1609922164,"Cyberpunk 2077 does not contain all the features that was promised by CD Projekt RED,

BUT the current state of the game gives a wide range of satisfying storylines, interesting character developments and it is just so great to explore the beauty of Night City. The scenery in every location is overwhelmingly beautiful.

We should appreciate the game in its current state, DLCs are confirmed, and we'll see what this game going to be!"
1609922349,"Honest Opinion about Cyberpunk 2077. First before I begin I'm not a good writer so bare with me as I make careless mistakes, okay back to talking about the game. If you're like me you probably were over hyped about this game only just a year ago not caring what would happen you and I were excited of what was yet to come. We waited and waited with delays left and right, being a nuisance and yet pleasing to see that the game was being delayed for a greater cause yet the game is still not what I expected it to be.

I had put in over 90 hours into the game but I feel like it's just not that fun. The whole leveling system kinda killed the game. Yeah sure it supposed to be a first person RPG but I feel like that it shouldn't had been in the first place, but maybe I might be wrong because maybe I thought it was like the next GTA 5. That is what ruined my expectation for the game yet I still think that the system is a failure. 

I was excited about the life paths you take whether it was Nomad, Street Kid, or Corpo and choosing one or the other was gonna make you have a different play style in the three paths, but yet I heard that it doesn't, it only effects dialogue which is quite a disappointment. 

Now my biggest disappointment is the Ending, what you're left with is around six endings I only did 2 of the endings but what bothered me was that once the game ended it will set you back to the final mission which is Nocture OP55N1. I really thought that you will continue after the ending and it was lame that it wasn't. You finish the game get the credits some of the character talk shit about you and then bam you start right before you start Nocture OP55N1. Shame.

I suppose I can conclude. There is so much more to complain but it seems like others complained already about them generally the game was fun until I finish the game, got my crafting skills to max, made literally the strongest weapon, put the difficulty on very hard, got bored, decided to mod the game a bit, got bored again. Sure I can start a different life path, change my fighting style, but it will all lead to getting bored after knowing that you're pretty much op. I hope whoever plays this game enjoys it far more then I do."
1609921892,"Let me ask you..
If a turd could be polished, 
Why are you holding a piece of poop in the first place??"
1609921768,It's not ready
1609921747,"Game's great. It's just great, I like it more than anything else I've played in recent time. I am very lucky to have a good system to run it properly. The minor bugs that I've encountered are easy to avoid and nothing game breaking so far. There are quite a few quality of life improvements that can be added and hopefully they'll come along. I look forward to all the updates it will get in the upcoming year and I'm really excited that it will become even better. Good job CDPR!"
1609921281,Boring linear story line. Mechanics and controls feel awkward. More bugs and glitches than any game I've ever played... It's just... not fun. The experience has been a combo of boring and frustrating. Such a shame.
1609921098,"YES the game is glitchy.
YES you may have to restart at a previous checkpoint to finish a mission.
YES it is very demanding of your hardware.
YES the police system is broken.
YES the game looks worse than GTA V despite being released ~5 years later.
YES the game is unplayable on consoles.
YES the combat is horrible and the melee combat is possible the worst in any game ever released.
YES the hacking and stealth system is horrible.
YES the driving is terrible.
YES the movement is glitchy as fuck.
YES the game has terrible RPG elements.
YES the life paths have no impact other than a different 5 minute start to your story.
YES the NPC's in the game are braindead and the atmosphere is dead and doesn't feel like an authentic cyberpunk experience.
YES the side quests are all fetch quests and don't tie into the main story.
YES exploring the world is uninteresting.
YES putting hours into the game is unsatisfying.
YES the mini map design is garbage
YES the voice acting is mediocre.

But does the game have an amazing heartfelt story with amazing emotional moments and a satisfying ending?





NO"
1609920826,Beautiful on PC. Averaging 37 fps on a RTX 2080ti Ryzen 2700x rig at 4K ultra with DLSS performance. Great story and exploration. Fun gameplay.
1609920695,"If you have a good cumpoter, you will be fine."
1609920684,"I mean....the hype is real. I personally have had very few issues with the title, and the ones I have had, haven't been as bad as something like TES or Fallout around launch. World is amazing! Dialogue is some of the best in recent years, voice acting is amazing, build diversity, loot, skills, weapons, etc are all hugely diverse. Only thing lacking imo, are the romance options (which yes, there are a few, but they are pretty strict on how to achieve them and only available with a very select few characters) and side activities, which boil down to a few generic types. This is supposedly going to be fixed later, and I trust CDPR as their track record with updates on past games is pretty amazing. Overall, fantastic title, and I can't wait to keep playing. If you're extremely concerned with bugs/glitches, maybe just wait a couple months for a sale before picking it up."
1609920645,Needs a solid GPU to run but it is easily one of the best RPGs you will play.
1609920537,Great game. Will play through at least once more.
1609920416,"Behind all the bugs and controversy, all the false promises and undelivered features, all the fake hype they accumulated over the years still lies a game that's mediocre in every aspect. I would suggest everyone to wait for all the DLC to be released with all the patches and then maybe you will play a finished product. Or if you really don't have anything better to play there is still mild amounts of fun to be had with this early access title."
1609920328,"great game, now waiting on them to fix the bugs"
1609919860,"One of the best RPG's I have played in a long time. Everything from the storyline, music, characters and gameplay was amazing. Minor bugs aside the game looks amazing, plays well and is really gripping overall. After spending about 100+ hours and completing all the achievements I am gonna miss the journey of V and Johnny. Can't wait for the DLC to come. Great work as always CDPR! You guys are legendary!"
1609919201,BUENO
1609919234,"This game is honestly flawed in almost every way. The game is not very good. However, that characters and their stories as you progress through the game are some of the best I have ever seen in a video game."
1609919152,8/10
1609919150,"After playing one of the V’s life path, I found this games has deeper meaning of the moral stories. I’m very fond of V’s character I made and playing more than 40 hours feel immersive of story choices.

Although this game has lots of bugs, the game is never disappointed for the CD project loyal gamers with a variety of gameplay features.

This game became one of the most enjoyable and interesting games I ever played. Of course, I will await rework, fixes, and upcoming DLC in the next future."
1609918894,"This game, from my experience, is pretty outstanding. The atmosphere and gameplay are some of the best i've experienced in a first person RPG. Easily toppling the gunplay/melee of comparible first person RPGs like Skyrim or Fallout.


There is a wide array of builds to experiment with, many interesting side quests and a city atmosphere that is really spot on.
The streets are generally filled with people unless you are in a more deserted area of night city and that can really make the city feel, at times, like you're walking in a futuristic Times Square.

That being said if you try to play this game like grand theft auto you'll be disapointed. There is next to zero police AI and you gain nothing for killing random NPC's. 

What this game brings to the table that, perhaps GTA or other open world big city games don't is diverse gameplay/RPG mechanics and an overall better feeling environment. You won't go on big police chases in night city that aren't scripted, but you also won't customize your franklin/arthur from GTA/RDR to be cyber ninja assassins with perks that apply poison, etc, etc.
You won't ever walk into a place that has the same engrossing atmosphere as the Afterlife club or walking through V's apartment complex.


So there is some trade off there.

It's clear there's more work for CDProjekt to do here as well. There are lots of folks reporting a large number of bugs.
I have, at the time of this review, 122 hours and I've only encountered a small handful of cosmetic bugs (cars popping in and out in the distance or clipping through clothes for example) but that may not be your experience and I'd hazard a guess that it most likely won't be your experience based on other reviews.

There are also some systems that need to be rebalanced or will likely get some love in future updates.

I would, however, recommend the game based on just how much fun I've had with it."
1609918677,Garnly Man
1609918132,3080 rtx horrible fps bugs every where
1609918119,They need to add the content they promised. Not worth the money
1609917997,it's okay i guess
1609917922,lotta bugs buts is fun as fuck
1609917884,"3/10
Get your SHIT together CDPR"
1609917772,Even with all of it that needs fixed its still a super cool and ambitious game that i've had a blast with.
1609917695,"deadass, 98% of the choices in this game don't matter. you get to choose the ending, and that pretty much sums it up. and they don't change that much, and even in some endings. cd makes the choice for you! isn't that cool? so much for the 'makers' of the witcher 3. and before you ask, no, the story is not really that good. it's linear, riddled with poor, passable writting and the understanding of themes in level with an edgy teen that thinks adding rape/torture will magically craft a deep and engaging story, and that shock value matters more than actually going through the shit your character and others suffer. oh, why have a discussion when you can just can it in a single dialogue tree (that doesn't matter in the end) and call it a day?

the 'good' side bits, which are rare, do not impact the story whatsoever, and rarely provides any kind of clousure. if you really want to buy it, wait for a sale."
1609917606,"Great gameplay.
Contrasting popular stereotype of bullying the game cuz of bugs, i havent encounted any besides having 1 quest bugged.

the balance is screwed, all quests are very easy, im on the highest difficulty and im playing the game as if i was a god, this is fun, for a while.
i havent even completed the campaign yet and im oneshotting everything.

id still recommend you buy it, great quests and a good world.
but the pc requirements should be noted, as many players have realised the game can be unimmersive if everything looks like a potato. its not the games fault you cant run it on immersive graphics.
"
1609917604,The only reason to buy this game is if you never had your heart broken and you want to experience what that feels like.
1609917273,"Great game. Story is engaging, every mission will keep you on the edge. Visuals are awesome, just a couple of glitches once in a while, hopefully those will be taken care of in the upcoming patch."
1609916997,"Game of the Year. 
The only complaint i have is, that the Main story quest line is too short. They made it shorter because people complained the Witcher 3 was too long, well that's on them if they cant finish a game don't short the rest of us out on content and story.
 To experience the game in full greatness don't skip out on your PC build. Next gen games need next gen hardware, don't complain if you are running hardware that's old.
May the glitches for ever be in your favor!

Graphics: 10/10
Story: 10/10
Game play: 10/10"
1609917010,"Strong negatives that may deter you from buying this game follow. While I like it, it's... well, it's gotten worse with the patches. I liked it, before the recent, ""fixes."" Still worthwhile if you overlook the massive, looming issues.

Story:

Great story here, if you can sit through a whole lot of sitting. There's a ton of plot to unravel and the main narrative is compelling enough to warrant your purchase, in and of itself.  There are multiple impacting decisions you'll make as you progress through this game, in both the linear and side missions. There's depth here and there's a great care employed toward crafting a world that's told as well as seen and experienced. There are very few problems here, despite several points where you wish you could just get on with it.

You can't skip major plot elements, even if you've already done them, for example, and some sections are scripted and on rails. A few of these benefit from this rigidity, some plots suffer and become boring.

Many side missions are flat and forgettable.

Music:

Pretty bad. You'd think there would be top-notch artists represented here, but it seems the indie approach was used. The only song that stands out for me, anyway, is Pon Pon Sh!t (except the ! is an i), and even that's pretty freaking bad. The other songs are just awful, like you take the worst of each genre and shove it in here. Generic, lame, and lacking.

Audio cues sometimes fail to trigger, probably because there are other missing flags for some weird reason. You'll complete some fight and the background music will remain tense and agitated.

Sound effects are fine, nothing else to say here.

Graphics and visuals:

Range from garbage to amazing. I'm not sure what it is, but sometimes, the game is flat-out beautiful and just purely incredible to behold. Other times, it's trash. Be it from unloaded textures, to semi-rendered 3D models, to NPCs overlapping each other, or trees just... blurring themselves into the ground, there are some real problems here.

Full disclosure here, my PC is top-notch. 2080 Ti, 64 GB RAM, i9, you get the idea. This game runs smoothly, but still somehow manages to look and feel like crap more often than it has the right to on this hardware. You can't excuse a car not rendering correctly and only having its hood appear and be a collision zone. You can't make trees bend into the pavement and blur massively, and you definitely shouldn't spawn the same NPC three times in a row, next to itself, and have it then stack on top of other NPCs.

The textures can't range from awe-inspiring to worse-than-sticking-your-face-into-dirt. Your patches somehow made everything flat and ugly, by the way.

Gameplay:

Monotonous outside of the main storylines. There's too much sitting and waiting around in the linear parts of the game, and too little plot in the side missions. Uh, oops, went off on a tangent here.

Your basic hack and slash elements are here. Stealth is virtually non-existent and you'll want to spec into health, hacking and like one or two other trees and just decimate everyone. There's little variety here, but it gets the job done.

Missions:

Range from boring to funny to truly deep. There's no telling what you'll find, but more often than not, it's just, ""Hey, V, go kill this asshole."" Rarely, you'll get something special, like Joshua, and when this game's missions are at their best, damn, are they something special.

Keanu:

Great actor, terrible character. He detracts from the whole thing. I can't feel sympathy to Johnny, no matter how much you shove it down my throat. He's an ass, always will be. If you can abide his persona, well, good on you. Luckily, he's only a major prick in the main storyline and you can just ignore his existence otherwise. His whole backstory, while realistic, is utterly pathetic. He's not sympathetic whatsoever. Overhyped, but well-performed, for sure.

Bugs:

Somehow, these patches broke this game for me. The first thing I saw after patching was an NPC walking through the ceiling up an invisible flight of stairs. Why? How do you fix some problems, but manage to break what wasn't an issue before? You've actively made this worse!

NPC cars will ram into railings while driving. NPCs will T-pose. Your clothes won't render, something that's gotten worse since the patches. Your hair won't render.  Your car will ram into and kill you when summoned. You'll get stuck on random bits of terrain while driving in motorcycles. When running on pipes or curbs, you'll accelerate at insane speeds. When running on arbitrary geometry, you'll just flat-out die for no reason. There are just so many stupid, random glitches.

Final thoughts here, well, damn. I like the game. I'll never love it, though. It's linear, the side missions are stupid, but sometimes incredible, the gameplay's solid, the main story... Man, Johnny's a prick... is compelling enough to finish, there's some replayability with the multiple endings. 

The music sucks. It's awful, there's no way around it. I really wish it was better, and for all of the Japan-inspired tech and overall thematic elements you're throwing into this game, there's an almost-pathetic lack of J-Pop or J-Core or other weeb stuff. The same can be said of other cultures. You just... skip the rest of the world in your ethnic circles of NPCs. No Russian music, no Korean music, nothing real for... man, you really dropped the ball here.

Not quite game-breaking, but close, bugs just somehow got introduced with these latest patches, and that's kind of sad.

I still... I still recommend this. It's a fun game, and obviously I've played enough of it to know, but, holy crap are there some real problems, both technically and... otherwise. Man, do I hate recommending it, though."
1609916700,"You will not know at 40 hours that cyberpunk is a good game, but at 90 hours you'll know it changed everything."
1609916642,"In its current state I can not recommend this game.  The bugs while annoying aren't to terrible, but there is so little to this game. All you can do is missions, missing features and almost no customization."
1609916637,"Very good RPG, story is well worth the buy."
1609916303,"TLDR: I consider a game worth its price if I’m able to get an enjoyable hour out of a game for every $1 I spend. As you can see, I got my money’s worth! I bought this game at full price and would do so again in a heartbeat due to its story and world-building. I recommend this game even if you’re just somewhat interested. 

I’m writing this review almost immediately after finishing the main story line and having done what is probably 45% of the side quests. 

The first thing I want to talk about is the story. For a game that deals with so many inhuman elements, it feels incredibly human. I loved the nuanced and complex characters you encounter. Also the amount of content you can learn about the world is awesome. You can see how science, religion, the human experience are impacted by this world’s events. The voice acting is great too. 

Other things I liked were the soundtrack, the amount of content, and the side missions. Some of the side missions have incredible detail put in to them. 

The one thing I’m somewhat mixed on is the impact of player choices. Some small and large choices have some really cool impacts on the game, but many intentional choices when it came to combat or a side quest just didn’t end up impacting my story in the way I thought it would. I can remember many choices in side quests are somewhat limited to the context of that side quest or a series of quests. It’s still a cool feature but maybe would be neat to see a larger impact from them. 

The things I didn’t care for were the glitches of course. I didn’t have anything game breaking but I encountered a few where I couldn’t progress so I had to reload an auto save and then things were fine. Some glitches were kinda funny with cars randomly blowing up and T-poses galore. I also wasn’t a big fan of the driving. The car handling is somewhat hard to get used too. All these things aren’t enough to not play the game. 

Overall, I’d highly recommend this game. I think many of my criticisms will be addressed in time. I think Cyberpunk will influence the narratives and world development of future games. It’s worth checking out. It’s going to be one of those games that will stay with me for a long time."
1609916300,"Fun game but pretty buggy and could use many QoL updates, other than that, the story is chill, really starts picking up towards the end, game gets loads of bad reviews due to the fact it is unplayable graphic wise and had long loading times on console, but its pretty good on pc, I really haven't had any game-breaking bugs or major issues playing so far."
1609916075,Bad
1609915834,Great game minus the crashes
1609915826,play the spunky cybers
1609915719,"It may be buggy and it may be unstable, but the problems that Cyberpunk has aren't game design related, so it CAN be saved. It is a fun game, its nice, and if you like RPGs you would probably like CP2077."
1609915631,69
1609915517,Bugs and all it's a good game
1609915242,This game is amazing and runs great on my system. There are so many very specific cyberpunk references they really did their homework for the fans. Definitely recommend this if you have the tech to run it!
1609915128,"Besides some game breaking bugs that can be solved by routinely saving manually, great game!"
1609915127,"if you've got a great rig, this game is good.  i've enjoyed my nearly 100 hour experience."
1609915050,Best Keanu has been in years. Great movie.
1609914983,"Recommended: When you build a supercomputer and wait for a few patches and free DLC.

It is really weird how they put the best stuff in the last 3/4ths of the game. I was disappointed at the start but it got better after a slog. CDR really didn't have enough time to finish it, a shame it could have been a masterpiece."
1609914935,"I watched 1 trailer before playing this and stayed away from the hype train. (I also played all the Witcher games as they were released.)

My save file shows 63 hours. You need premium computer hardware and a 120Hz capable 4K HDR10 TV for the best possible experience. Don't bother if you have anything less or just lower your expectations."
1609914931,fix this crap.. should be embarrassed
1609914917,Love it!!! Will love it more once more of the bugs are gone and we get DLC :)
1609914659,Honestly good game memes aside tho i say wait for updates or sale to buy
1609914501,"Honestly, I loved this game.

Pros:
-Great, compelling, and in depth story-line
-Fair and enjoyable game-play
-Beautiful (Ultra Settings)
-Heavily player involvement based.

Cons:
-Unable to free roam / complete side mission / progress after beating game UNLESS you make a manual save before initiating final mission. You do get a point of no return message but this is not what I thought it meant. Wish they inserted an autosave point before this. Luckily I have a manual save from two missions before so I have a way out, just shame I believe I'm going to loose my loot and rank and what not from the final mission.
-Occasional glitches however I did not experience anything game breaking. Plus I think little things make the game more unique, enjoyable, and add some character. (Like how everyone loved the swing-set launching glitch on GTA 4)
-LOTS of dialog. Granted a lot of it is enticing and part of the storyline, it could seem a little too much and time consuming at times. Some I felt was useless as you only had one option you could say so you were simply clicking F to keep the story going. However, there were a fair amount of action packed fight events to counter it at times.

Hoping to see a free roam option or fix for those that already beat the game and I think multiplayer will be fun when it happens!"
1609914467,"Yes it does have hiccups, but in the hold outlook of the game, it is engaging. that is the main reason i play games anyway."
1609914441,"Bug. Everywhere. T-poses, sudden teleportation, instant death, NPCs acting weird, etc. etc. This needs to be fixed. 
That said, I've played this game for almost 200 hours already and I've enjoyed every minute of it! If you need a game to be bug free, either wait for it to get fixed or stay clear. However, the characters, the story, the combat, the enviroment, the esthetic. AMAZING! It's worth playing."
1609914320,"No long winded rambling review here, the game is great. Does it have some bugs? Yes. Are they game breaking ? No. Buy this game!"
1609913917,"It's really good, especially if you don't have a bitch in your ear telling you it sucks. :D"
1609913875,After playing this game for 50+ hours I can honestly say WOW! This games has its little bugs here and there and yes I have crashed once also. But I can truly say this game requires a high end PC that has a good GPU. Bugs or no Bugs I would suffer to play this amazing game. There is tons of people that are very upset about this release and all the ugly issues it has had. If you have a decent PC and are not trying to play this on a Dell from the early 2000s then trust me GET THIS GAME! Yes you will have random bugs here and there and if you are like me and understand that 99% of any games being released now days are all BUGGY then this will NOT upset you! 10/10 for me sorry for the people who cant enjoy it as I have.
1609913679,"There are so many things wrong with this game, not including the bugs. The dialogue is slow and and your chat options are meaningless. The game disables your guns, run, and jumping abilities far too often. Especially annoying is how the game disables your clothing, even when you're just standing around waiting. Oh, and the number of times I had to ""press C to sit down"". That sucked. 5% of this game is the Sitting Down Simulator."
1609913642,"This will be a long incoherent rant, I have never loved and hated a game so much before. I get emotional over a story only for my sentimentality to be interrupted by some ridiculous gamebreaking bug forcing me to either reload a previous save game or to exit out and restart the game. I feel like a total badass speeding through the city avoiding traffic like obstacles and drifting around every corner scaring the pedestrians without destorying or killing anyone and without even scratching my ride, only to be flung up 500 feet into the air while driving across a bridge and crashlanding into the ocean.

At the time of writing I have over 450 hours played in Cyberpunk. I have unlocked most achievements and experienced the majority of content in the game. To describe the game with a quick reference to other games I would say it's like a combination of Grand Theft Auto and Elder Scrolls in a cyberpunk setting but riddled with more bugs than all Bethesda games combined. If you don't mind quicksaving constantly and saving the game very often to reload previous save points when you run into a completely gamebreaking bug every 10-15 minutes then you might enjoy playing through it once or twice. If that doesn't sound very appealing I would recommend watching a playthrough of the game instead.

Bugs. This is the most buggy major game title in history. roughly 3% of all lootable items can't be picked up because of bugs, if you pick up a dead body and put it down again it can launch off at the speed of sound in any direction and fuse with any object it comes in contact with, any headwear have build in chemo therapy and may cause temporary baldness, Things that are supposed to spawn might not spawn, events that are supposed to trigger might not trigger, beware of jump as you may die upon landing, beware of crouching in tight spaces as this may also cause immediate death, when in a vehicle gravity may disappear and toss you up high in the air, dialogue may bug out and overlap with other dialogue or happen at strange times such as when I was sneaking around in a holy temple trying to hide a dead body and a monk walks up to me and shouts in my face that I'm not allowed to smoke on holy ground... Sure thing mr monk just let me hide this corpse and I'll stop smoking right away I promise.

Most of the development seem to have been focused on worldbuilding and eyecandy, which is why I recommend to watch playthroughs of it. I love many of the characters as they have interesting and striking, well developed personalities and stories tied to them. V, the player character on the other hand is a bland, shallow mess and options to try and make the main character more interesting are just non existent.

Game mechanics are awful, if you use bladed weapons or fists most enemies you kill will trigger a fancy execution animation, the problem with this is if you want to kill 10 people quickly everyone still alive is forced to watch you take 5 seconds to do a fancy execution and after seeing this supposedly fancy execution occur 100 times you're just sick to death of watching it as it interrupts the flow of combat and makes everything really boring. Don't bother throwing poisoned knives at people, first of all most major threats is either just adam smasher or cyborgish cyber psychos which are all resistant to poison. Poisoning normal people is a waste of time as you can instantly kill them 100 different ways so why bother with something as slow and ineffective as poison...? jumping through a window can be hard sometimes as the mechanic to jump over obstacles and get in or out of the window might not trigger the first 500 times you attempt to make it happen. Sometimes your opponent will have their vision flipped backwars, so if you see them looking away from you but the minimap shows their vision is towards you it's a 50/50 chance that either one is correct so make you best effort guessing and good luck with that.

When it comes to game difficulty I thought Skyrim and Fallout was quite laughable but Cyberpunk takes it even further and only at the highest difficulty do I find trouble running up to everyone I see and punching them in the face until I'm the most legendary fisting merceneary to ever set foot in the afterlife bar. Most OP weapon by far are revolvers as you can oneshot everything in the game with a guaranteed headshot crit dealing 150k+ damage... Other weapons you may only crit for somewhere around 100k damage and FYI everything excepot cyberpsychos and Adam Smasher dies after around 25k damage, so the question is not really if you oneshot things but rather how hard you oneshot things.

Overall the game is fun but bugs make it frustrating, I can't recommend a game with so many bugs and so underdeveloped game mechanics and options. The world is gorgeous and full of characters I love but the important things is not that everything is so detailed I can have a dancing Hatsune Miku hologram on the pack of condoms I pick up in some alley but rather how my character can interact with the world and change it.

5/10 gorgeous game so go watch a stream of it or a playthrough on youtube."
1609913580,yes it is buggy...and yes it is still worth it
1609913467,For all the faults that this game had at launch it was at heart an amazing game with fantastic gameplay and excellent writing. This really was a fantastic experience. Slow to start for sure but ultimately one of the most immersive experiences I have ever had.
1609913225,Aslong as your pc isnt a potato you shouldnt have many issues. Love the game!
1609913004,everyone who is complaining about bugs has obviously never played skyrim or fallout in its early days of launch amazing story and gameplay also Keanu Reeves is daddy
1609912925,"Massively disappointed, this is a game that should have gone through significantly more development. There are many issues that can likely be fixed through patches, though, there are also many issues that seem cemented into the core gameplay experience. For instance, any semblance of choice this game provides the illusion of having is quickly squandered once you simply reload a checkpoint to restart a conversation, choose the other ""important"" yellow dialogue option, and get the same output through a slightly different series of verbal hoops. So far, at the MOST, a yellow dialogue option may add some convenience to a specific quest, or may provide a slightly more rewarding outcome. There doesn't seem to have been much of an attempt at creating a sense of malleability to the storyline, as most dialogue choice and player action (such as being stealthy in a lethal or non-lethal manner, or being balls to the wall guns blazing) seems to have a negligible effect on the story/game world. The three ""Lifepaths"" you can choose between (Corpo, Street Kid, and Nomad) are mostly cosmetic, you will go through an intro unique to one of these three lifepaths, but after that, you start the same series of quests, regardless of your lifepath. Over the story, you will be presented with lines of dialogue that you can speak depending on your lifepath to add more... lore, I suppose? My point is that lifepath based dialogue is typically negligible as well. I don't know, at least you can pump stats into your ability to have sex with other NPCs. 

Despite its linearity, the story is alright so far, quite a few aspects feel underdeveloped, but its neat if you aren't playing this game for the varied RPG experience.

The world of Night City feels hollow, not much to say. The buildings are pretty, and the alleys are nice, but it still feels quite plastique. Bodies of water don't react to impact most of the time. Environmental props are typically static. I suppose if you purely want that Cyberpunk aesthetic, this game may be for you, but there isn't a great amount of interactivity. The animations are neat, when they work. The textures are neat, the lighting is fine, not necessarily a mind-blowing game, graphically speaking. Oh yeah, the game doesn't necessarily provide the most transparent means of indicating level scale based on area. Be sure not to stray from the starting section of the map until the story pushes you out of it, or you grind to hell to finally match the ridiculous amounts of damage enemies will lay upon you outside of the starting area. 

The AI is like a downgraded Roomba™. If the AI path is blocked, whether it be a car or walking civilian, they won't figure out how to simply go around, nay, maneuvering around is the simpleton's solution, instead, the car will wait, completely idle, until the obstruction is moved. The civilians will do one better, if they are walking down a sidewalk and they find their path to be obstructed, they will just, turn around and walk in the opposite direction. Real next-gen stuff. Oh yeah, if you shoot in a crowded civilian area, do not stray your eyes from them, for if you do, they will despawn, as if they were never there, I wasn't expecting to have purchased a higher budget ""Everyone's Gone to the Rapture"". Enemy AI is quite poor as well, their detection is inconsistent, and their effort in combat is quite inconsistent as well. Enemy cops will spawn outside your field of view, right next to you, sometimes even within your field of view. Cops have no method of chasing you via vehicles, all they can do is spawn by you, Christ, even GTA III had cops down mechanically, in 2001.

The gameplay is like a more underwhelming mesh of Deus Ex and Borderlands. It has the looter shooter feel without feeling as refined as Borderlands, and it has the hacker, stealthy feel of Deus Ex, without the good stealthy and hacker feel of Deus Ex. It attempts to stand on the shoulders of its influences and ultimately slouches while having poor footing on the shoulders of its influences. It is a game that feels like a middling attempt at a few different styles of gameplay. You will likely experience the tedious loop of killing an enemy, picking up their ^ DPS gun, placing attachments on the aforementioned gun, killing the next enemy, finding their ^ DPS gun, removing attachments from your previous gun and putting it on the new gun. It is a tedious cycle, and it doesn't have the rewarding feel of finding a rare gun in Borderlands that beats out the prior gun you've held on to for the past few hours. The upgrade tree is an upgrade tree, it works well. Don't follow the attachment hints, they're useless, for instance, a sight will literally be captioned with ""Adds 0.27 zoom"", what the hell does that even mean? Overall, gameplay's pretty meh. 

Glitches and bugs, this game has many of them, you will likely have fun with them, they will likely break your immersion, and they will likely be patched almost completely in the future, but at the time of this review, the game is still riddled with them.

TL;DR: Wouldn't recommend, story's alright, world is poor, AI is garbage, gameplay is passable, this game is, at best, mediocre on some fronts, and piss poor on almost every other front. Overall, the game is probably a 4.5/10."
1609912889,"Despite all the bugs (Which make the game funnier), this game is amazing. I loved every second playing it, good story, short story at that. Really fun give it a shot."
1609912869,Loving the story line so far! Graphics are amazing!
1609912841,"I would recommend this game only if immersion isn't a deal-breaker for you because the numerous bugs really hurt the immersion, otherwise, although buggy, still a great game!"
1609912725,ARRRE ITS A BEST GAME
1609957045,"Let me start by saying this review is about gameplay/story. I did not experience any game breaking bugs, the occasional t-pose, trees bending, cars falling from the sky happened but it wasn't an issue as far as immersion.
The story was amazing. The character development really makes you care about the characters you meet. However, I did not experience just how good it was until my third play through. I highly recommend taking your time and going through the blue chat options before the yellows. It really does add to the depth of the characters and you will learn a lot more about each character’s personality, which definitely added to the enjoyment of the game for me. I also recommend playing on a harder difficulty than you normally would, it will help make up for the NPC combat AI being not great at times. Ultra hard didn't really make the game any harder for me, it really just forced me to play the game somewhat smart, using cover, stealth, silencers, etc. However early levels of a sword build can be extremely rough on ultra hard so keep that in mind. 

The gigs/jobs/side quests felt more compelling when you follow the directions instead of just running in guns blazing which is what I was doing on my first two play-throughs. Watching the npc scripts play out while you're creeping around warehouses and whatnot was pretty cool. The npcs would give you clues on where to go in the gigs and give more background information on the crime they have committed, which is the type of attention to detail that really pulls you in and helps with immersion of the game.  Don't skip computers, at the very least skim through the emails, some are funny, some are helpful information wise. Creeping on important side character’s emails will give you more character depth.  Disclaimer, I did not read all emails, shards, etc, but I did try to at least skim as many as I came across.

I play at 1440 with all ultra/psycho graphics and the world is absolutely breathtaking. Sometimes it was hard to believe that video games have come this far, graphically. I found myself taking a ton of screenshots, which is something I don't normally do while playing games. I felt like a damn photographer at times. I found myself captivated by the billboard ads, news stories and random interactions between citizens in Night City.  Obviously, the AI could use some work, but during covid times, this game really helped me feel like I was out in the real world again and I appreciated that quite a bit. The music is phenomenal. ALL of it slaps.

The endings were all great in their own way. The secret ending felt the best to me though because I got so attached to all the characters. I want to do another playthrough as a female V, but CDPR did such a great job with immersion that is hard for me to be a girl, lol. I really cannot get enough of this game, female netrunner camera watcher will be my next playthrough. Once they iron out the issues, I can see this game becoming one with a very high and consistent player base. There truly is a ton of great content already there though. The main story isn't insanely long, but Johnny being around for most of the side missions and gigs made the side stuff feel connected to the main story. 

I don't normally review games but I enjoyed this one so much that I felt I needed to leave one. These are my opinions on the game, if you guys don't agree, thats alright, I am not here to fight with you. Seriously though, if you are into story based content, this game does a much better job than most. Again, take your time, its a single player game, no need to rush. This is the most important piece of information I can leave for people. Normally I kinda blow through stuff and just get the jist of the stories from the cinematics and the text choices to advance stories, but this game is infinitely better by hearing/reading everything that the game offers.

I look forward to spending more time in Night City and I cannot wait for DLC and CDPR to fix all the bugs."
1609912489,"On a PC with decent HW, this game is *Epic*. With a bit more crafting, it could be Legendary. Here's hoping CDPR takes the Path of Glory."
1609912425,i'm bored nothing to do after everything is complete. quick hack i one hit kill everyone on hardest difficulty.
1609912418,is cool
1609912386,This game is a beautiful immersive experience! I loved all the multiple ways you could go about completing each mission!
1609912210,"The game has its faults and bugs, no doubt. But ,I'm 39 hours in and overall enjoying it so for anyone who is accustomed to games like fallout, witcher and mass effect with their own set of bugs just go for it."
1609912173,"我是傻逼！

Je suis un idiot！
Ich bin ein Idiot！"
1609912160,funny penis game
1609911907,"good story, good gameplay, needs patches to say the least."
1609911869,"Super fun game with tons to do, but... a ton of bugs. Wait for the game to be patched before buying."
1609911840,"Amidst all the bugs and cut content and broken quests there is a pretty damn good game. A wildly ambitious game that over promised and under delivered. I do think there is something quite special here and people should play it. Just not right now.... unless you are willing to battle both evil corporations and the evil corporation that rushed a game to market.  For the rest come back in a years time.

So I recommend the game to time travelers from 2022. 

 (I do want to say these kind of abuse's of labor are not unique to CD Project red. They are an aspect of the entire entertainment industry. What's unique is people paying attention. I also think the gaming culture that over hypes games and sends death threats to devs is toxic and needs to die. That culture is as much to blame for this half baked game.)"
1609911792,"Cyberpunk 2077 is a very stimulating and fun game for me despite usually not enjoying single player games. The graphics are the best I have ever seen. That said, the main story itself is not super interesting but the open world and game mechanics make Cyberpunk a fun game to play."
1609911598,"This game seems like it is designed for High end PC builds. I would run into Frame drops and random glitches in the side quests. 
Other then the hate already laid out online. I really like this game. I find it fun and challenging. I played on normal for my first play through. Then i played very Hard and tried to 100% it. I think this game WILL be worth it when the bugs are fixed. Other then that it is really emersive and amazing. Johnny Silverhand is with you the entire game and it is a beauty to see. Every play through will feel a bit different with different choices. BUY THE GAME for the fun of it."
1609911466,"Just beat the main story, I'd say my yes is a maybe more than a certain. I went in mostly blind, only saw the ad trailer so my expectations werent high. In terms of a game i think its pretty standard shoot bad guy, move along a set path, talk to person, shoot bad guy repeat, but the character development and writing is next level good, tack on great visuals spawned from a drug trip fueled by netflix deal money and you get what the developers went for. 

worth 60$? idk if you have decent PC; bad times are 15fps, great times are 80's. I think compared to what a lot of games offer you for $60, this doesnt feel like robbery after finishing it"
1609911461,"The best game I have EVER played from an emotional standpoint even beating my longtime favorite GTA IV, the entire thing is a work of art including the personalities of the characters

this review coming from someone who played every single side quest mission and main story line 

I cannot wait for multiplayer to be implimented if it ever will be, this will then become my fave of all time"
1609911445,"I have enjoyed cyberpunk. I know it may not have lived up to the hype (nothing could have), and that there are issue with console version. But it runs fine for me and i have enjoyed it."
1609911161,"Has some bugs but runs great on my PC, still a great rpg experience"
1609911125,soo much great content
1609910985,This games epic Games
1609910849,"If you can ignore the random bugs, visual hiccups and oddities, and overall lack of polish, the game is incredibly fun. Great story and writing. Side quests actually have some meat."
1609910772,"The game has it's flaws. It's not in any way perfect, yet I have no regrets buying it and playing through it twice. The story is worth it. Even though, it is clear, that some story lines have been ripped off (ex. Judy's story is added to Panam). 
I had a blast playing it. Have a complete playthrough and don't mind doing it again. 
After playing this game for two times I will put it on a shelf until they add either DLC or removed content to the game, or until the nostalgia will blast me.
Try this game, it is good. Unless you are playing on console, than you are screwed until they'll fix optimization. ;)"
1609910728,"On a technical level this game is kinda meh, the skill trees are underwhelming and some things just seem broken (sniper rifles don't need any skill points to be a 1 hit kill weapon on headshot) BUT (and this is a big but) the game can be really fun, the characters are super charismatic and combat is actually pretty fun."
1609910627,well worth the $3000 pc I had to build just to play it
1609910521,"Deus Ex + Borderlands + GTA = CyberPunk 2077
Over 100+ hours in.  It's fun.
"
1609910507,"Cyberpunk 2077 is by far one of the best First Person RPG's out there! As far as open world games go, this one is as fleshed out as a fresh off the table liposuction patient. It seems like there are little surprises at every turn of a corner. It is loaded with hours and hours of fun outside of questing even, inside a city that feels more alive and thriving than a Larry King interview. What I'm really trying to tell you is, that if you're not playing this game anytime soon then you're missing out on not just an amazing gaming experience but a life experience that you will share with your children and grandchildren,"
1609910500,I mean the game kinda sucks. I think we all know that by now.
1609910475,"The game is buggy as fuck 
and yet it is still fun as hell with an amazing story and fucking great voice actors
but make sure you put some graphics on medium unless you have beefy pc
"
1609910411,"I can't recommend this game to anyone until all the bugs are fixed. Who knows when that will be. This game is half bugs, half story. If that's what you're into, go for it."
1609910001,it's aight
1609909938,"awesome
"
1609909880,"I don't want to spend too much time typing as well as sucking the game off, but I enjoyed it and recommend it as it's a diamond in the rough."
1609909877,for the low cost of $79.99 you too can hang out with keanu reeves
1609909679,"If you know nothing about the game before playing, it's a good game after all."
1609909546,"Still issues, most i was able to ignore. Suddenly my graphics in game went to hell, and much of my vision was blocked due to long lines of pixel looking pillars. I tried loading previous saves and they all seemed ""corrupted"" with this issue. it was about 4 hours into the game when this first happened. Right away i made a new character, and it was max settings pretty again, about ten hours straight before it happened to me again. I spent one really long day trying to play this game. i loved it, but its unplayable now. No response on any means of communication from developers."
1609909372,"it has its flaws, as many games of this genre (skyrim, the witcher 3), but still is an enjoyable and replayable adventure, that sometimes tend to be kinda linear, but that doesnt interfere con the quality of the story behind. If you love secrets, exploration, rpgs, cyberpunk, retrofuturism, and a lot of fantastics vehicles, beautiful and sometimes very graphic scenarios. The game still need to be polished, and the possible implementation of some lost features, but still is a game that can shine on its own, and definitely a good investment of my money. Already on my second playtrough (the first one was a semi rush to end it fast, but still ended up being like 60 hours), and still not bored, and almost completing all than can unlock by myself, and thats over 100 hours of gameplay."
1609909217,"Great game held together by a duct tape. If you get too bothered with bugs and glitches then wait for a patch later in the future. Reminder that the Witcher 3 came out as a buggy mess and turned out to be one of the best games of the last generation, arguably ever. 
Cyberpunk is a must-play for RPG fans."
1609909118,great game despite the bugs
1609908992,fun
1609908888,"good story, fun map, gameplay kinda gay"
1609908848,"I love this game a lot
I'm doing the other ending which there is 5 a very story rich game. A lot of other side missions which are not rushed but some are very dumb side mission that are talking about the brain dances which no one cares about,
They do need to fix the optimization when it is runable for most p.c's i will give this a higher score as it is now its a 8 out of 10 
(side note im runing this game on a 2080 it and a i7 7700k with 100-80 fps on 2k)"
1609908559,"Ah yes, a game that I, like everyone else anticipated greatly(but still less than my father coming home) and for me at least, it delivers. There are complaints that the game is buggy, but it is more stable than my family, so no complaints from me. I am very happy to use the beating techniques in game that i learned from my father before he left. I have more choice in this game than i do in real life, and best of all, you get to have SEX. Enough said"
1609908553,"This is a game that if you really delve into you will love 

PROS. 
An amazing written story that really gets to you 
Bountiful side quests to add to you time playing at the time of this review  have put in 60 hours into it and that's only my first play though i intend to go back and make a few different choices. And I still did not get everything.
AMAZING GRAPHICS. granted im using a 2070 super currently so I am able to push Ray Tracing while near max settings and keep a pretty constant 40fps to 60fps in some areas even within the city. 
Mantis Blade combat is by far my favorite im loving it all you begin to feel like a true badass. 
Sound design and Soundtrack are perfect it all fits together perfectly. 

CONS: oh boy here we go

Bugs: there are plenty but compared to my first play of fallout 4 not as bad though i may have been lucky I have had no game breaking bugs a few visual bugs such as render draw distance phasing buildings out at a distance when I rotate the camera. any most of these issues where fixed by either saving and reloading the save or a quick relaunch a bit undesireable but nothing i would say breaks it for me.
Some larger NPC bugs that where less fun and humorous where the floating enemies and burried enemies. but again nothing that wasnt fixed by a quick save and a reload.
 
 Physics: heres where my real complaints come other than the bikes and even they are some times hard to control. Cars are abysmal I bough the Avenger and every time I clipped a sign or a curb the car would spas out this pacticular car was the worst offender.

Bikes are great till you need to use the brakes and that brings us to the next bit brakes dont feel realistic.
cheaper cars and more expensive performance cars seem to brake all the same something I dont like. 

There are a number of bugs that cause visual problems such at weapon cards staying on the screen when no longer in inventory or text boxes staying on screen or Johnnys distortion staying longer than intented. but all these bugs car usualy solved with a quick save and a load of that save. 

Clothing bugging out and you run around in what you think is full loadout and your just wearing a jacket.

Overall this game is great and is worth the cost and I have great faith that like Witcher 3 CDPR will correct these issues and overall improve the performance of the game. And should there be a need I will add to this list of pros and cons."
1609994520,"6.5/10 an ""Okay"" experience. 
Will review again after major patches are in place. 
TLDR, Buy on sale or deep sale, 39$ or less

The game if you have been following it for a while before release is an underwhelming experience that shows that the game a rushed, unpolished and cut experience. However if you know nothing of the build up and hype on the game, you might enjoy it and consider it closer to a 7 or 8 out of 10 experience. I am the former. 

You can tell as you play the game that this is a GTA wannabe with an old UI and systems that do not belong in the ""next gen"" category. There are features you can tell are remnants of what could have been, which due to time constraints must have been removed. The NPC ai is borderline non-existent making the world feel less immersive as they are just there to ""fill in"" space. And the enemy AI is not much better either. I guess I am trying to say that the world feels devoid of life and the spark that gets you to believe you are in a real living breathing place, with bustling crowds, crime and violence round every corner. And certainly the sheer amount of bugs do not help at all. We are fortunate that this is the most stable version of the game. 

Not all is bad however, the graphics on the PC are stunning, the music is excellent and the story is engaging. However this does not offer real consequences and plays around with the ""illusion of choice"" which some may find lackluster.But I still enjoy the storytelling and characters. This is likely what will encourage me to keep playing the game. 

In any case, I do feel bad for the developers who worked hard on this game only to have their leadership make decisions that ultimately caused this mess of a release. I just hope it can get the polish and become the product it should have been after the fact (a la no man's sky redemption ark).

Until then, I do not really recommend the game at full price. Maybe pick up during a sale."
1609908496,PC version has minimal bugs.  The scope of the world is amazing.  Its a joy just wandering around and looking at stuff.  So far its great.
1609908280,"Yes it's kinda buggy, but way less than any Bethesda game. Gamers will play one of those less fun, less immersive games and bitch while playing them for 1k hours. Grow up and maybe form a memory and use it later. That's what I had to do with Skyrim before buying this game."
1609908258,"Very emotional game with decisive paths you can go down, definitely would recommend regardless of any bugs or prior expectations, here's to the future of the game."
1609908151,"Good ,complicated a bit, but yeah had a lot of fun,just kinda ignore some things,might get better in other updates"
1609908018,"Wow, just wow..."
1609907991,"Maybe it's because I tend not to get hyped up or because I find most things more appreciable, but after all is said and done I absolutely love Cyberpunk 2077. I have not been so captured and captivated by a world since the Mass Effect trilogy. The world and lore is really fleshed out regarding the history of the world and its current events and story. The characters are absolutely emotionally engaging and human, from the romances to the greatest villains. The atmosphere is absolutely captivating, and (I personally find at least) the game play flows well. Just my hours in the game should tell you something.


Now that being said there are some genuine criticisms of the game. Of course there are the bugs (which thankfully for me at least are not game-breaking and at times are downright hilarious), weird driving physics, and a lack of customization post-introduction.

There is a lack of content concerning the late game, and the romance characters later in the story.

This game was definitely rushed near the end, and could have done with a few more months of polish, which I feel we need to address. 

These are valid criticisms of the game. 

However, the community's reaction to the launch is getting way out of hand. I played Fallout: New Vegas and TES: Skyrim on console release as well as Mass Effect: Andromeda on PC release, and they were way worse than Cyberpunk's launch, and yet I still loved those games just as much as I love Cyberpunk.

The state that the game was released in, I believe is no ones fault, except for the money-hungry lizard executives who sit at the top. They are the ones who forced the team to put out an unfinished product, despite it not being done. The marketing team excelled at their job, resulting in the game being hyped like no tomorrow. The development team had managed to put out a game that I absolutely love, despite numerous hurdles. 

People forget the amount of shit the dev team had to deal with. A number of crucial game files were held for ransom for example, not to forget the freaking pandemic we all find ourselves in. Not to mention that according to a clause in Polish economic law, they had a certain deadline to meet to satisfy a loan qualification. Many of these folks had to take time away from their families and loved ones to finish this project. 

All the while the community kept berating them to finish the game. When the delays started to come, the community got even more upset. And then when the game was released, instead of the community understanding, the team drew even more hate. 

I understand that a lot of people may be upset, but come one guys, we need to be better. Doing things such as sending death threats to the devs is an absolutely shitty thing to do. Too many people are getting irrationally angry instead of being understanding, which is something the world needs a bit more of right now. It's because of things like these, I don't like telling people I play video games or associating with this community. 

By all means voice your criticisms about the game. I did just now. But also remember the human faces behind the production, and remember the situation in the world right now. 

In conclusion, I highly recommend you get the game IF you feel that a great story, character arcs, and captivating universe outweighs an uncertain amount of bugs, some unpolished mechanics, and a slight lack of late game content. 

If you cannot in good conscience purchase the game according to the balance above, then by all means, wait for a sale or for the bugs to be patched."

1609907868,"It's alright, I guess."
1609907709,"For as complex the developers told us this game would be, it's actually quite underwhelming. Despite the bugs, the core of this game is not any better than any single player game in the past. It lacks a load of features that would make the game feel more complete such as a subway system, customizable cars, more weapons. The list is endless. Until bugs are removed and the game feels more complete, I cannot recommend this game.

I will admit, the game is immersive and fun, but not what the consumer expected. There are quite a few immersive breaking mechanics as well. Stopping to loot mid stealth mission, or picking up other various items laying around can break the immersive feel the story gives. Not only that, but most loot is irrelevant. The crafing system at this point is irrelevant, and most loot just takes up space you don't need. 

Its also quite disappointing that your dialouge choices do not affect anything within the story of the game. It only affects the dialouge you are currently in. That also leads to the sad fact that there is only 4 different endings. The freedom within the story is not as what I thought, yet I am not disappointed with it because it was still fun. 

Do not get me started on A.I., including police A.I. This turned me away from the game as well. 

TL;DR this game is fun, the bugs will get cleaned, although I would not consider it anything special as we all hoped for. It feels like another single player game with missing features.

1609907662,"This game is a triple a game and as such has some bugs, but the devs have handled it much better than most other triple a companies. Regardless of the bugs, it is still a great time."
1609907657,"Unbelievably disappointing, buggy and half baked. Don't incentivize this type of behavior from multi-million dollar game developers. They had a DECADE to make this."
1609907571,"Story and quests are top knotch, OST is AWESOME.  Has glitches similar to bethesda style games tho.  Which unlike bethesda are sure to be ironed out and fixed. Multiple optimization patches have come out already and more are sure to come."

1609907217,"Love the game, sad to hear what others have to say.  I mean how the hell can my shit box can run it, I'm running i5 4590, 16gb and gtx 1070 in 1440p with high and medium setting. Stay strong cdpr"
1609907173,the game is broken but it is also funny
1609907096,Absolutely awesome game. Don't listen to whiners complaining about bugs.
1609906986,"Played on release and was honestly not expecting anything at all other than another game to play during quarantine. 

Avoided pretty much all the press releases and game play that was out there leading up to the launch and thoroughly enjoyed the game and the bugs were honestly not that bad, if anything they added to the experience. Its marketed as an rpg game but is hollow in its execution because of the lack of impact from choices save for a few main story ones and even then it doesn't change a whole lot. A little disappointed in CDPR in the lack of choices that actually mattered compared to their previous work, mostly Witcher 2 because of how drastically different the game plays out but I digress.

The main story is pretty good and the voice acting is very immersive as well as setting which is absolutely gorgeous. Having the privilege to play this at a playable 60 on an ultra wide with RTX on with all the setting maxed out definitely had me sold but in the state that its in I can't really recommend this to anyone due to all the problems I've read about with people with lower end hardware let alone a console.  Maybe in a year it'll be more fleshed out and worth checking out."
1609906966,people overeacting
1609906939,This game doesn't deserve the hate it gets. I think it's interesting and fun and I think the glitches make it more fun
1609906862,"Honestly if you look past the bugs in the game (which are currently being patched) it's not that bad of a game.  Granted that it's not what was sold as at all. I mean you saw the trailers and went cool Far Cry in a Cyberpunk setting.  And well it wasn't that at all but if you go into it expecting to not have that.  It is not that bad,  granted the modding community on Nexus is fixing more than CD Projekt but still modding is easy.  Let's hope they don't get their mods broken by hot fixes"
1609906823,"Overall, it is enhance version of Wither->>>>> Wither in the future"
1609906593,Good game
1609906516,After my 4th restart I now like the game. There is a lot of stuff to digest.
1609906454,"1st of all i'll get it out of the way, yes bugs and glitches which some broke the game although at the time of writing this they are not as bad. I have completed the main campaign and only went through one ending with all side quests completed (none showing up at this time). Aside from the early bugs and issues the game it self was amazing. Through out the game i felt myself filling the role of V and the interactions between characters. As the mission progresses and events take place it does a great job of making you emotionally involved. There is a grind though when it comes to your player level where as the Rep. level will hit max very quickly. I feel this needs to be addressed to better balance the two. I recommend working on the side quests more then the main missions to help this out or you will end up like myself at the last main mission and being no where near max player level. Over all i enjoyed this game and would recommend it especially now that most bugs and glitches have been fixed."
1609906328,"There's a great game behind all the glitches, but the lack of content and POOR optimization really hold's cyberpunk 2077 back. id recommend waiting a year for the GOTY edition to go on sale with all the patches and dlc available."
1609906219,Pretty eh. Its a shell of what could have been when you look at the existing pre-release trailers and unfinished assets. But when you remove that factor its good for what it is.
1609906196,.
1609906135,"Overall, a good game.  Good plot and lots to see and do."
1609906183,"This was my most anticipated game of 2020. Unfortunately, it has some serious bugs, missing features, and has disappointed me personally. Many have reported massive game-breaking bugs that have crippled their ability to play the game. Most notably for me, were Police spawning inside buildings right next to you; during a certain mission taking out some Arisoka snipers, the map terrain not being loaded properly after reload; and inventories across vehicle and apartment stashes going from being synced to not being synced and in a rare case, lost completely. But, to it's (or possibly more to the original creator of Cyberpunk's credit), it has a beautiful and immersive world, engaging story and relatable characters. Though the gameplay is not exactly what i was hoping for after watching some of the trailers and promotions for the game, it is still fun and expansive. The ability to to choose between going in stealthy, using quick-hacks to disorient enemies and take them down quietly or guns blazing with a number of different handguns, rifles, shotguns or melee weapons at your disposal was great. The crafting system is an interesting addition. But, became less and less a feature I used as I got further to the end game. What saddens me the most about Cyberpunk 2077 is the very apparent need for more time for this game to be properly developed before launch, this game is good, it just needed more time and better management in it's development. Hopefully, this game can become what it was meant to be. TL;DR : It's good, but needs more time. Buy later, after the bugs are fixed, missing features are added and DLC's are introduced."
1609905996,meh good for the first like 20-40 hours then after that it just exists
1609905937,"Alot of fun for me. i saw reports of bugs but i had no major issues just a couple of t poses, All that said i really enjoy this game"
1609905932,"Hey, the 'tubes say this game and company have all kinds of crap going on.  But ya know what?  On a PC anyway, this game is pretty much exactly what I expected.  55 hours in, and I'm looking for a little more story, but I like it regardless.  Only crashed once and encountered a game-stalling (but easy to work around) bug once.  And I'm having a lot of fun.  I'd buy it again, and I haven't regretted playing it.  Knowing what CDPR did with The Witcher series, I'm looking forward to what comes next.  Honestly--you could go wrong if you're playing it on the ""wrong platform"", but that's a different kind of problem.  As-is, on a decent PC, this is worth the money and time, and more time will tell if it's worth even more.
"
1609905828,I have only experienced one major glitch where the game completely crashed/flat-lined but other than that I've had a lot of fun with this game! I don't have a super gaming rig but enough to run it on a 1440p monitor.  There have been minor glitches here and there but nothing to hinder the gaming experience.
1609905782,Shut up and take my money!
1609905674,pogchamp
1609905407,"A lot of people went into this game hyped into believing this game would have the depth of an old-school isometric story RPG, the gunplay of a AAA multiplayer shooter, and the ability to roleplay beyond what any game has done before.  The game is glitchy (though not overly so in my experience) and rough around the edges in many ways, but it is a phenomenal experience.  To be specific on where it shines:

- The combat is fun as hell
- Tons of ways to play and lots of potential character build experimentation
- Worldbuilding is world-class.  Tons of history to explore, and it genuinely feels like a lived-in world
- Guns feel powerful when fired
- Design and aesthetics of the world and characters is phenomenal
- Driving feels good

At the end of the day, this game is pretty damn one of a kind.  The only games I feel like Cyberpunk 2077 can be properly compared to are the modern Deux Ex games and Fallout 4, but it honestly blows them out of the water.  

Too many people are comparing Cyberpunk to a game that only exists in their heads."
1609905252,"Welp. The game is clearly unfinished, buggy, outright broken in some places... the AI is functionally braindead, and the gameplay is almost ridiculously easy, even on the hardest difficulty.

But dammit, I loved this game. Or at least, most of it. The characters are so well done, the voice acting is spectacular, the city is wonderful, the graphics are amazing when they're at their best. The models are so well done, and the cars look great - but handle rather poorly I must admit. The storyline was great, though somewhat predictable. And a lot of the side missions are just absolutely amazing, though they can be missable if you plow through the main story and don't do side content. Which is kind of a shame, to think some people might miss some of these side quests. Panam is the best! And that ending was awesome."
1609905220,"I really want to like this game, and I have nothing against the developers, but it is incredibly poorly optimized. I have a pretty good machine, and can run every other game in my library on at least high settings, including titles such as rdr2, and this game is unplayable for me. This paired with the bugs (graphical and otherwise) warrants a negative review, though hopefully they will be fixed in the future."
1609905069,Good game but very buggy
1609904816,this game f-u-c-k-s
1609904746,"This might not be a very useful review if you are seriously objective about video games but in my experience it is a great game. Yes there are bugs that needs to be patch ASAP but I respect the game for what it is. 

Being in Night City is such a jaw dropping experience. I was so immersed in this game and the attention to detail is amazing. 

I will admit, driving is just absolute garbage and combat isn't that great. The weapons itself are pretty cool but the crafting and upgrades and just overall features are not like your typical RPG. They kinda feel generic. If I could compare the combat system it feels very much like Apex Legends.

I guess I could call myself ""winner"" because I did not follow the hype of the game. I know It wouldn't be a game changer but to me, I don't think I've ever seen an open world cyberpunk sub genre in a video game before. So when I saw the title of this game ""CYBERPUNK 2077"", I immediately wanted it just because its called ""Cyberpunk"". When I got it, I was still happy because its exactly what I wanted, an open world cyberpunk sub genre..

So don't listen to gamers who are unfamiliar with the RPG genre of video games because they won't be bothered to appreciate aspects such as the world / map; attention to detail and dialogues.. If you expected this game to be a cyberpunk version of GTA, you're looking into the wrong game.."
1609904697,"Unfinished product. Beautiful world, there's almost something there, but it's just not complete. Needs another year or so in the oven."
1609904694,"Nice story, well optimized for PC"
1609904504,Like the story and the characters but the game is way too short and there is nothing to do in the game once you beat it and the side missions. hope they will come out with some good dlc.

Bugs aside, I recommend the game I got my money's worth of entertainment after completing the story once. I will play through again soon. Not many complaints personally other than performance and missing content. In its current state, I still think It is a good game just not perfect. Side note bugs are annoying and there is no excuse for them. My game never crashed but I know others have had issues.

1609903172,"I love this game. Today I saw a cop who was tied to a chair and about to be executed by four gang members. I then killed all the gang members which led the cop magically escaping his restraints to the chair. He then gave me a one-star wanted level for shooting the gang members, pulled out a stun baton, and proceeded to chase me around the block. Cops are very appreciative in this game."
1609903091,"This is the first review that i write. Sadly it isn't a good one. Even the story is good, the game is so full of bugs and glitches that ruined the experience for me. I wish i waited until the game was completed and it was $10 buck on the store."

1609902975,meh 5/10
1609902884,"Despite the issues at launch, this game has a lot of potential and I think, once CDPR gets some patches out, it will eventually be amazing. Depends on if CDPR listens to the community or not. I have faith."
1609902876,"I find it really fun to use the Contagion quick hack from the shadows and make npc's look around, then take their head off with a sniper rifle crit before goin in guns blasing.  Would totally spend more time with Panam, Judy, and Claire.

Would definitely recommend players to take up crafting so that you don't end up with random loot as BiS.  Was stuck using booty shorts on my male character cause they gave more armor than anything else for a (relatively) long time.  >.>"
1609902856,"I would recommend but beware of many bugs and optimization issues, otherwise there's a couple hindering aspects of the ai and other systems that will simply take time for CDPR to work on and fix, but it has one really good story and some amazing characters to enjoy."
1609902712,"not worth 60 dollars, penis 2 master race"
1609902552,I have overall enjoyed this game so far. the action is good my frame rate has been just fine. Albeit I do run an Nvidia 2070. Still for my PC no issues. I will say the driving mechanics are a little wonky still. and there is some definite Gaffs in the writing or scripting... whatever it ts that the designers came up with that allows you to move on in certain portions of the game. So without spoilers. if your stuck do not be ashamed to look for a walk through. and I would not recommend banging your head on a wall for 5 hours trying to do it on your own.
1609902413,100 hours in. finishing side quest before the point of no return. so many things to discover and you're missing out the bulk of the game if you just go through the main story missions.
1609902354,"Story is great, gun play is great, melee combat is great, quick hacking is enjoyable, OST is second only to DOOM. Only downside for now is various visual bugs and issues, very few game breaking problems on PC that cant be solved by a quick checkpoint reload."
1609902343,"Even after 32 hours, I feel like I have barely scratched the surface. I never really got hyped up for the game and did not have high expectations going in. I like the cyberpunk genre so I was expect CDPR to deliver a good story as always. Sure enough they have, the main story is enticing and the side missions feature well written characters that I have grown an attachment to in a way few other games of the genre do. I highly recommend the game, thankfully I meet the recommended specs so I can't speak to the experience on lower end hardware however, the bugs that people seem to be so hung up on are little more than temporary audio or graphical bugs that can either be ignored or removed with a simple reload of a quicksave."
1609902264,I used to run it on a 1060 and it was perfectly fine. If you have a decent PC then give it a try!
1609901954,Lots of bugs but still worth playing
1609901841,"definitely still has its fair share of bugs and some NPC problems, combat isn't the best until you get a to a higher level and start specking into one of the skill trees. But, the main story missions and the more important side missions never fail to entertain and the side characters you meet really feel like characters, not so much real people but they have more filling then what you find in a lot of games.  Play it now if you want or wait a bit till some more patches come through, either way its a definite recommend."
1609901793,"The game isn't the second coming of Christ.

It is, however, one of the best pieces of action RPG I've played in a very long time. You want to be a silent assassin? Ghosting in to kill _only_ your target before leaving? No problem.

What about am angry techie, who kills everyone in a building before ever stepping foot there?

How about a straight up gunner. Shrugging off enemy fire through the help of tech and stims? 

Yeah, not exaggerating the above and a lot more are possible. This game is fucking awesome from a gameplay perspective.

Storyline? Let's just say it's one of those that I had to actually digest after finishing the first time. I don't think I've 100% all the content yet, but man, some of these sidequests (Evelyn Parker, anyone?!?) are some of the best side content in any RPG game. People who skip the sidequests are missing out HUGELY in Cyberpunk 2077.

I have put all my playtime in on an i7-8700k, 1080ti, 32GB RAM. The unfortunate fact of the matter is that there ARE bugs even on my rig. I can confidently say that I've had ZERO actual gamebreaking bugs, but it can get super frustrating to slide off a curb at exactly the right angle and die by fall damage. Yes. A curb. (It has to do with the slide physics accelerating you)

Other than that, I have also seen the bugs like:
 - Cars popping into your vision can have broken physics. If two spawn inside each other you often see one get launched into orbit :D 
 - Not being able to loot a weapon or a body because it's partially clipped into another object or wall
 
And clearly missing features:
 - No transmog system
 - CANT PREVIEW ITEMS ON YOUR CHARACTER BEFORE BUYING THEM. WTF?!?
 - Police don't chase you

I honestly think that given the TW3 or Skyrim treatment, this game is going to be a must-play on PC for years to come. It really is that fun.

If you can easily afford it, buy it at full price and support the devs. If not, wait for a sale and pick it up. 

It was bullshit what CDPR pulled with publishing this game to previous-gen systems. it works for some people, but it seems like the majority are getting fucked. Should have delayed previous gen release by another year. I think a TON of the bad press for this game could have been avoided if CDPR management had done that.

Unfortunately, on the business side it was probably easier for CDPR to eat the bad press and release a shit previous-gen rather than fail to meet contractual obligations. Lame either way."
1609901475,Great game after updates have stabilized it. Highly recommend to anyone at this point. Don't let the rocky launch dissuade you. 8.5/10
1609901444,"The hate's gone too far! Look, we all know about the launch issues, and the game does not yet live up to the hype. But it's a ton of fun, and while I've experienced a few bugs and crashes, not nearly as many as the bad press led me to. (Balance issues are a bigger problem at this point IMO.) I play on both a mid-range PC and a basic PS4, and it's definitely better on PC, but it works just fine on both. Great game, only gonna get better."
1609901498,"The game is great don't get me wrong. It's just very unnerving to have 71 hours in a character for none of the save files (All 19 of them back to 19 hours playtime) to not load randomly one day.  This is post 8MB save file fix as well.

4/10"
1609901790,"A beautiful city and a masterful story ruined by bugs, worthless dialogue choices, performance issues, shitty & repetitive sidequests, and a police force that has magically mastered teh ability of teleportation. CDPR crafted this amazing city, and ruined it with so many other issues. I wanted to love this game, but I simply couldn't. 



Also why do cars handle like someone sanded the tires, rubbed them in butter, and sprayed WD-40 over every road, truly I do not understand how they made driving so bad in this game."
1609901265,"If I were to review the game they advertised id give it like a 3-4 out of 10. If I were to review it as an incredibly standard RPG set in in a really cool world, with cool characters, and a pretty engaging story id give it like a 8 or 9. The bugs were not truly awful for me though so your mileage may vary depending on how buggy your experience is. More times than not they were a quick visual thing that made me laugh, and the more annoying ones (I had 2) just required a quick reload. take it how you will but I had a lot of fun with it."

1609901129,"LIKE: The game has a parkour element that I find surprisingly satisfying. Running, climbing and jumping. Making the game VERY 3D in scope. I'm always looking up for an advantage.
DISLIKE: Don't know if anyone else is experiencing the quest override. So I tag a quest to track in the city and EVERY incoming GIG overrides the current quest objective. I want the game to keep the gigs and side jobs coming, but let me change the tracking status."
1609900948,"such an amazing game, i hope cdpr continues working on it. massive potential"
1609900824,better than the media sayings
1609901567,"Cyberpunk 2077 is a really great game with the potential to be an excellent game. It not only offers the engaging storytelling CD Projekt Red has become known for, but manages to introduce a well developed worldspace complete with interesting characters, thrilling conflict, and a mix-match of unique sci-fi ideas that come together in a way that feels organic and well thought out. But as everyone already knows, the game's excellence is severely undermined in a number of ways. For me, this didn't hinder my experience all that much, but your mileage may vary-

THE STORY-  The story of Cyberpunk is easily one of the best features of the game overall. I've seen a lot of people claim that it doesn’t meet the narrative heights of games like Deus Ex. While RPG options are more vast in Deus Ex, I can confirm that the statement is otherwise a bull faced lie. The story here, while being rather small scale, is tight knit and extremely well written without feeling the need to wallow in trope heavy moralist themes that needlessly consume the narrative focus of many sci fi tales like the one mentioned above. While there are major stakes throughout the game, V’s story is relatively small scale, mature, and self focused which serves to make the surrounding world elements feel more natural and believable. This combined with some really interesting side characters and scenarios makes the world of Cyberpunk feel like it has a lot of room to creatively expand. The darker story beats combine with the well done musical score to create extremely captivating narrative sequences that emotionally gripped me in a way I haven’t felt since Far Cry 3.

EXPLORATION AND ARTSTYLE- The bug filled libertarian hellscape that is Night City is entirely fascinating if not wholly original. The game takes noticeable inspiration from many sci fi themes in older films like Bladerunner and The Matrix while adding the more cynical angle of a dystopian future present in Black Mirror and Demolition Man. These themes and ideas come together really well when infused with Cyberpunk's character focused dystopia and become extremely noticeable as you explore Night City. The gangs and Corporations that vie for power are all unique and feel much like the factions you would find in a Fallout game (Scavengers kidnap and disassemble helpless victims for their implants while VDB uses tech skills and subterfuge to fight Corporations for control of the internet.) This adds a layer of intrigue to the side content and helps combat feel less monotonous because you aren't just shooting at generic baddies. Even side gigs take unexpected turns and genuinely deserve your time. 

COMBAT AND AI- The combat in this game feels like COD gunplay had a lovechild with Fallout. But while I feel that the combat is really clunky at times, it still manages to have a nice flow that keeps the action fun and exciting. The weapon design is phenomenal- while most sci fi games typically have a very bland selection of small arms, this game has to have the most functionally diverse array of weaponry I’ve seen since the likes of Halo. Different weapon types feel special and have really unique designs that, while feeling believable, also manage to capture the creative imagination of what weaponry could be like in 30+ years. It’s a shame that this game uses the Destiny style common to legendary weapon scales that severely undermines the enjoyment of using and upgrading the various weapons systems and usage of the crafting mechanic altogether. It makes you feel overwhelmed and made me only want to stick to high DPS weapons I was familiar with on my first playthrough. Hand to hand combat is extremely clunky and feels like the AI animation locks onto you in order to land a hit. Shootouts with a higher level enemy goes the way of Fallout 76. High level enemies don’t have anything that makes them unique from other enemies in a challenging way, they only have a damage and health bar increase that make them feel like a frustrating waste of time. It’s even more disappointing when you fight unique enemies in the main story who do actually present different combat behaviors with new challenges because it makes you realize they could have done it with these high level enemies and just chose to cheap out. Finally, police and regular AI are bare minimum in every sense of the word. Cops will spawn on top of you for doing anything that aggravates them, no police chases exist because the AI vehicle pathing is bad so they disappear after you leave the immediate area. Entire crowds of people will disappear just from looking away from them and you can stop the flow of traffic by just parking near the AI’s pathing.

THE BUGS-   After over 100 hrs playing this game, I found bugs range from humorous to straight up horrid. While I was fairley fortunate on my first playthrough and only experienced a handful of major bugs, my second playthrough started after the last December patch was far worse. If you’re banking on the January patch fixing almost every bug in one foul swoop, I advise you tailor your expectations because it’s gonna be a good long while before everything’s patched up to where it should be. But while the bugs could be really bad at times, the overall experience still won me over.

Overall, Cyberpunk was an incredible narrative experience that I found to be entirely worth my time and attention. While I am extremely disappointed in how CDPR Corporate decided to handle distribution and how many features that should be in this game are either unfinished, broken, or unincluded, I can’t help but feel that the game (even in its current state) is an experience far better than the vast majority of AAA releases this decade. The developers and writers deserve all the praise they can get for creating such a refreshing open world game, it would be a shame to see them take the fall for the Corporate level's utter failure. While the game was disappointing in some ways, I really enjoyed the core of what it had to offer and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who wants to experience that narrative journey *if* and *when* the framerate issues and bugs had been mostly ironed out."
1609900571,not bad
1609900434,It really do be 11/10.
1609900337,The people who dont like the game are the same ones who rushed the developers. Ya got what ya asked fer. Personally i love the game 10/10 and im excited to see CPR turn this into the next no mans sky. Which they wouldnt of had to do in the first place if y'all had just been patient.

1609899914,"I'm a huge fan of the Cyberpunk genre and this game did not let me down. Thinking about future possibilities in the relatively near future is interesting to me. Cyberpunk is kind of like what Star Trek and Star Wars was regarding thinking up technology and inspiring a generation. I just 100%'d this game so I'll give my pros and cons. Overall, this game is definitely worth playing, but I can understand people waiting for some of the bugs to be ironed out. I'm excited for future DLC.

Pros
-Fun - if shooters aren't your thing, switch to gorilla arms or mantis blades. You can be stealthy, hack enemies brains from afar,  or go in the front door, guns a blazin'. There's many options and i dabbled in all of them. Even if you don't care for the plot, the playstyle still makes it worth it.
-A+ world building - this game makes you feel like you're in 2077 in every way. From the ads to the ambient news reports to the cyberware to the overall environment. Take a moment to enjoy it when playing. I often found myself just looking around or even watching tv in-game. 
-Music - this kind of falls into world building, but the music sets the mood well. I particularly like the end credits song ""Never Fade Away"" covered by Samurai. Car radios allow you to listen to multiple stations so you have options. 
-Plot - Though the plot had some holes or areas that could've been done better, overall I enjoyed the story. It was an emotional roller coaster at times which is pretty much what you'd expect of NC. Defining the boundary between human and machine/computer is certainly a main theme as well as societal collapse and lack of government control or oversight on corporations. It's real enough to be plausible in 2077 and challenges you to think about these things. 

Cons
-Buggy - as of writing this, there are some bugs. I personally had music and sound effects that would continue playing until reload. Sometimes there would be times where V is stuck in run or walk modes. Sometimes things glitched through walls or got stuck in places. Overall, these were only minor irritants. 
-High hardware demands - I met the recommended spec for PC, but could only play at medium graphics quality. It is well known that the game suffers in this regard. I'd love to play it in the highest settings.
-Open world questing - this game suffers from the dreaded open world questing that games like Skyrim suffer from (imo). Too many rinse and repeat quests that you finish just to finish them (though they are not all required). 
-Boss fights - I felt like there should've been more dynamic boss fights. I wasn't too impressed with boss fights outside of one or two of them."
1609899842,"The hotfixes and patches have really improved the overall gameplay.
I have played through the entire game twice so far, and I can say with confidence it is one of the most fun games I have ever played."
1609899819,"i was so excited to meet Johnny SilverHand for the first time. Specifically because its frickin Keanu Reaves, but the first time i run into him trees are trying to render through his face! Its not Keanu Reaves, its frickin KEANU TREEES!

...Runs great and perfectly smooth on PC. Highly recommend this game."
1609899779,Good story so far and the game play is pretty fun. The game has some issues but they'll be fixed.
1609899722,"The game runs at much higher framerates than the awful ""critics"" online say, but the glitches and crashes make it nigh unplayable. I've used a 2080 Ti and a 3090 with it. the 2080 Ti crashes so much that it's quite literally unplayable. The 3090 crashes 1-2 times per hour. Being able to play longer without crashing shows off all the lovely glitches like:

1. People will start shooting you at random, even inside businesses where you don't show any hostility
2. Cops will randomly come after you even if you have done nothing wrong (not even jaywalking, which does indeed make cops attack you)
3. NPCs will fly across the map out of nowhere and then get stuck in the wall like darts as they continue to walk, talk, and act as if things were normal
4. While walking down the sidewalk normally, once again having done nothing wrong or posed any threat, sometimes almost everyone around you will drop to the ground, cower, and beg for their lives, while the remainder of people walk around and act normal.

It is beyond error-prone. It's beyond glitchy. As a developer myself, I'd be fired for releasing this as a finished product. It's beta at best.


HOWEVER, there's NOTHING HOMOPHOBIC, SEXIST, OR TRANSPHOBIC. That is just people looking for things to be offended over and that's coming from a bisexual socialist (me, obviously) who has spent years fighting for my own and other peoples' rights. Critics calling the game dehumanizing are also blatantly missing the point of the game. It's a corporate, neo-fascist dystopia where profits far outweigh human life and people are bought and sold like commodities and disposed of if they ""break"" or get ""damaged"". That's LITERALLY THE POINT OF THE GAME."
1609899525,Kids scream when i run at them with my dick out 10/10
1609899367,great game
1609899364,great graphics. good game play
1609899239,"I believe this game can be fixed over the years if CDPR does it right.
Let's all hope for a No Man's Sky like comeback"
1609899204,Story is worth it alone.
1609936589,"It should be noted that most of my game time is offline, so I've logged more than a hundred hours, and completed the main story line.  As for my bottom line for this review:  At present, Cyberpunk 2077 is a good game.  Give it three to six months, and I think it will be a great game.

A little context.  I largely ignored the hype, so I went into the game without any expectations.  I'm playing on a upper-middle end computer with a RTX 2070 card, and the game worked for me out of the box.  It did not, however, work without its fair share of issues.  Prior to playing this game, I was revisiting Fallout 4.  Games like Fallout 4 and Skyrim shipped with many issues that were eventually fixed by the mod community, which is my way of saying that my expectations were not as high as some of the reviewers.

Good points first.  Night City is the star of this particular show.  Physically, it is a large and complex city, and it is a real pleasure to wander around in it (assuming you are not being shot at).  Both sound effects and music are excellent.  Voice acting is consistently superb.  It's not just one or two characters that are well voiced, it is all of them.  I like the stealth system, which does a good job of covering all the bases.  Skill helps, but you have to make good use of your environment as well.  Being out in the open, but still invisible, does not happen.  I personally enjoyed most combat, but I am not a FPS guy.  I prefer stealth and finesse.  Finally, there is always something to do.  I cleaned up almost all of the side quests and crime quests, as well as the main quest.  I'd say there is about a hundred hours of gameplay here for the completionist.  Quests break down into vigilante work, thievery, assassination, and sabotage.  All come with a backstory (read the detes), and several of them are surprisingly inventive and well written. 

On to the bad points.  The city is largely static.  Your character will have very little effect on anything.  Casual dialogues never change, though your actions may show up in newscasts from time to time.  The police response AI is truly bad.  Do not annoy the badges.  It is not worth it, and you will be swarmed as they teleport in and come at you from all sides.  The traffic AI also needs a lot of work.  I strongly recommend you acquire a motorcycle as soon as possible.  Often cars will jam up on a street for no apparent reason.  A motorcycle will allow you to get around them without mowing down pedestrians.  Also, driving from the third person point of view seems to be easier than first person, though driving as a whole needs some tweaking.

And then there is the companion NPC AI.  For me, this is the worst part of the game, and what makes it particularly bad is I like most of the NPC's, but any time they accompany my character on a mission, I end up want to to shoot them.  Companion NPC's will get in your line of fire, as well as force you out of cover.  Also, they talk. . .God, how they talk.  Tuco (see, the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly) once said:  ""If you are going to talk?  Talk.  If you are going to shoot?  Shoot.  Don't do both.""  I wish all game designers would adhere to his wisdom.  I do not need NPC's telling me I'm about to be spotted, especially during the brief lull in the gunfight after I've already been spotted.  I do not need NPC's shouting insults from the ridge as I try to sneak up on an enemy position.  If the game allowed me to shoot Jackie or Panam, I would have done so. . .and I like both of those characters.  But they really need to shut the hell up while on mission.

Needless to say, the whole companion NPC thing is a pet peeve.  I really wish you had the option to solo the missions where you are required to have a companion tag along.

Finally, I'll wrap this with some comments on the endings.  SPOILERS AHEAD.  

To be honest, I'm not all that happy with any of the endings, but I get why the writers did what they did.  The whole Cyberpunk genre is not one of happiness and light.  It is dark and dystopian, and no one ever gets an untarnished happy ending. . .but I guess I'd still like to see one.  The Panam ending gets closest to an ending where all of your hard work kind of, sort of, means something, but even the Panam ending leaves you wondering if you accomplished anything other than a brief stay of execution.  I will certainly replay this game, but once I clean up all the side quests, I probably will not go past the ""point of no return"" again.  Really, what is the point?"
1609899050,right in the middle good story enjoyable to play as soon as the games done and you dont wanna do side quests theres nothing to do except make a new story

1609898704,"If you can get over the bugs and your computer can actually run it, it's a pretty good game with some well written characters."
1609898534,This is one of the best games I have ever played. I am a huge fan of the cyber punk genre in general. I think this game really brought all of that to life. I am playing on a mid tier graphics card and have had only very minor bugs so far.

1609897900,"to say it's disappointing is an understatement

I played the prologue effectively twice as I had a game breaking bug and by the time I got to act 2 it was blatantly obvious just how much content was cut/stripped from the game I couldn't bring myself to continue

maybe in 6-12 months they can correct the so many wrongs but I fear so much of it is baked into the core of the game there is no coming back from this"

1609896787,"Wait for the patches. 
After I finished the game I felt as if there could have been more. The Main story felt short, but the side quests were good. Feels like the main story is missing 6hrs of content. I felt as if I was 2/3 of the way through the game when it ended.

But wishing there was more means that they were going in the right direction. I enjoyed what they had."
1609896696,yes buy play enjoy
1609896613,damn boy the end fucked me up
1609896610,"definitely would recommend the game, i know it got a bad rep due to the over hype people had for it, but speaking for pc alone, game has proven to be the most immersive experience ive had in a longtime amongst the 100s of games ive played. sure its got alot of bugs, but so did skyrim, and i still happily dumped 1000s of hours into the elder scrolls games. now if is it everything i hoped for? not quite, the story is a bit short, definitely was sad to finish it out so quick after getting so immersed, but the side missons on their own are always fresh and add their own bit of story to the game. I hope everyone has the same experience ive had with the game, it truly is a spectacular gaming experience, and heres to hoping it will get more content in the future, because i will definitely revisit this masterpiece!"
1609896345,"I'll begin with writing to say that I have loads of respect for the good folk at CDPR and in some parts, I still do. I mean, they made Witcher 3. That was an incredible game, wasn't it?

I will point out, some of the flaws that I had encountered are already fixed, but the game still leaves much to be desired. My expectations were also relatively above average for the reason that they had some great graphics and immersive story. Well, the bugs did ruin a major part of that immersion.

But anyway, I played this game on day 1 release. Installed it immediately as well when it first opened up and made my own character. The game then got stuck in the character creation screen because I didn't touch the genitals option. The game then crashed. I thought ""Okay, maybe I messed up somewhere, so I'll just restart somewhere."" and so it was. Maybe it was just a one time thing?

I picked Street Kid because you get to play as a guy with loads of connections in the city slums and that seemed useful to me. I had some dialogue options that helped me out because I was a street kid. I gotta say, the game was pretty enjoyable. Very cinematic and enjoyable at that time.

Then, I did the first quest, where I was supposed to rescue this one lady from some crazies. Well, the game was pretty interesting honestly, I didn't even know that Jackie could vibrate through walls, especially through a closet of all things. I also want to point out that that the combat proved to be very lackluster. The shooting was pretty odd and hacking your opponent's brain will just have you get hit by several bullets. Totally not fun to get shot like that.

Furthermore, after doing some exploration for the game, while it was for the most part great, I saw some flaws. For starters, people have been complaining about flying cars. They weren't there in bulk, as in everyone has a flying car. Well, I'll tell you this: My car flies just fine! I do have little control of it, but, hey, flying cars do exist after all, even if it has wheels.

The world itself is pretty expansive and I enjoy that part. Lots of interesting sights, I gotta give it that. But, the graphical fidelity kind of ruins it. We were promised very different things in the gameplay trailers, like better lighting and looks and stuff. We can enter every building, they said. Tell me again why I can't enter a laundry service to get my clothes washed? I mean, don't get me wrong, the game would be several times bigger as is it is if I could just enter a Japanese Laundromat in Japantown and say hello to the friendly clerk. Still, don't make promises you can't keep. But, I digress. The graphics are still spot on for me. I like the look and neon lighting of the city. Kind of enjoy the sights at night after I climbed some roofs to see the city roads.

The AI in the game... I have mixed feelings for it. I'm a moron when it comes to stealth, so eventually I got into plenty of dumb shootouts with enemies that I could have avoided. Why the hell was this one Maelstorm thug not shooting at me anymore while I was literally standing right in front of him, with only a waist high barrier dividing us? Could it be that V scared him and he is too afraid to shoot him? I mean, he already destroyed me with loads of shots moments ago, why did he stop there? Another example is a bit better. Did you know that [spoiler]on the heist for that one chip you had to steal at Arasaka HQ?[/spoiler] Yeah, Jackie does his best to stay out of the way in the stealth sections, but when you [spoiler]enter the elevator to escape to the car, because for real, I don't think any of us wanted to tangle with that big robot, he just stood outside the elevator door staring that beast down. And then he dies. Well, shit, I can understand why the heck he died when he gets shot so many times by that giant bot because he just stood still.[/spoiler]

Now I want to address something else. The driving in this game is one of my pet peeves. Driving a car goes just fine, but a motorcycle has been pretty difficult to use on sharp turns, ending up with me crashing and in one incident, I ran over a police officer completely by accident. Naturally, I apologised, but instead they started shooting at me. It would make sense because the game doesn't transmit my voice or anything like that. Speaking of police, did you notice they also spawn everywhere? Yeah, me too. Corpses also disappear after I look away for 2 seconds. Those ruined it for me as well. And finally, my final thing will be about the traffic in this game. It works just fine on the highways (at least to me. Maybe somebody down in the review section will make a fuss about how cars are clipping through the guard rails and just crashes everywhere) but nothing annoys my immersion more than being in the middle of the city. Did you guys notice that the traffic lights always go green when you get too close? I mean, one second it was red for me, then I just arrived at a traffic light and it lit green immediately. I know, it's so dumb. Then I thought enough is enough, I've seen everything. Which is surprising to me as well, because I was supposed to have at least 50 more hours of fun in this game. It didn't come.

While the game has plenty of flaws and Keanu Reeves playing as your buddy in your brain that will kill you within a few days which was pretty cool, everyone likes that guy. Seriously, it's hard to dislike him. The game is in a much better place than it was on day 1 release, if still very buggy in its own right. Regretfully, I don't really want to recommend the game at the current state it's in. On the 1st of March, I'll get back to this game to see if they fixed most of the pretty obvious bugs. For now, I can't recommend it. I grant it a 4.2/10. I hope it will improve itself by the time I'll get back to it. Maybe I'll edit the reviews?"
1609896310,Awesome game
1609896246,kurwa jest git a jak oddaciee to co obiecaliscie bedzie giciunio a tak ugulem pozdrawiam
1609896107,great game! sometimes have to load save to fix bugs but its nbd. runs just fine on my 980ti
1609896087,"This game is great, but don't have high expectations yet. There still is a ton of bugs and the stealth is almost useless unless you spec from the very beginning. However, close quarters combat is fun and the gun fights are keep you invested. instead of mindlessly shooting person after person you have to pick and choose your shots while being aware of your surroundings. For first time playthroughs i would suggest a gung-ho approach."
1609896006,"Though the game is mired by bugs, overall it is a wonderful experience. A dense world to explore with many interesting places and characters and story line."
1609895970,"Is the game good? Yes. Does it live up to the hype? No. Glitches ? Yes. Game breaking? Not really.

As much as I would have protested another delay for further polish on this game, It could have used another 6 months if im totally honest.
"
1609895970,"If you bought what you heard. I'm sorry. So did I, but I wasn't so mad about it I got my money back. Honestly it's a decently fun game. However, the intro section of the game is so cumbersome and rail guided it hurts to have to play it again when you try out a different life path. Oh, outside some flavor text and dialog during the game, life paths are irrelevant. Of course the better PC you have the better the game plays, but if you have only the minimum requirements just make sure to scale back your graphics settings and I hope you didn't buy this game for that. I care more about game substance and play-ability than graphics so that didn't bother me too much. 

Basically you have very few actual choices that will affect the overall game. Which is the one thing I bought into really hard was the ability of your actions having true affect later. Meh. Yes and no. Mostly understated or just irrelevant affects. Most of the time you just have to say what they want you to say or just stop playing the main quest because you can't move on until you do.

If you came to this game for the crafting. Don't. Just don't. Go somewhere else where it actually matters and has depth. I mean it's definitely useful. As a matter of fact that Technical Skill is probably by far the most powerful skill in the game outside if not ahead of the combat skill you want to focus on. However, the randomness of certain Crafting Specs and the fact that whatever your favorite weapon is is probably not even craftable takes away from it. Also the end perk for Technical that you have to get Crafting Level 20 for is basically useless if you've gotten your crafting skill to 20. If you have crafted and ground your way to a high enough level to get to 20, you don't need money anymore. You have more money than you can use in worthwhile ways (if you avoid useless vehicle purchases). Not to mention that some of the numbers on the items you craft and mods you install on said items don't seem to add up. Maybe they do mechanically (maybe not), but visually my armor that should add up to something ridiculous like 9850, but the numbers in the stat block is like 3750. There have even been times I've upgraded the mod to a higher stat mod and seen my overall armor go down. I mean I'm sure it's a bug, but it seems to be a dumb one for the time they had to work on this game. (I was trying not to say that, but it's impossible not to mention).

**Somewhat Spoilerish** (You've been warned)

All the Side Jobs and NCPD (map marked) quests are prefab and one shot. Random criminal activity still happens as you travel around, but once you've completed all the jobs, that's it. You might as well run through that awful ending scenarios and get on with life and move on to another game. In reality if you play everything just right, you can put a save down right before the final quest of the game and play through all the endings in a row without having to play the game over again. After that there's nothing left to the game. It has a drastic drop in replay-ability. Once you've found your sweet spot play style it's hard to play it a different way and enjoy it. Thank could just be a me thing though.

Extremely limited ending conditions. Not only that they feed it to you via video voicemails. What a shitty, lazy, anticlimactic way to do it. It kind of makes all your hard work to affect the world kind of not worth the cereal box toy you get in the end."
1609895806,Gud gaem

"
1609895643,"[H1]Cyberpunk 2077 is a very good game.[/H1]

Cyberpunk 2077 [i]is[/i] a very good game.  I completed the game twice in its entirety, once as a hacker and again as a swordsman.

Cyberpunk 2077 is also very [i]buggy[/i] game.  I believe that bugs can be fixed and that, given their track record, CDPR will fix these bugs.  I'll be commenting on them, but largely disregarding them because I expected them and was able to work around them.  The bugs I personally experienced were annoying, not game-breaking.

Cyberpunk 2077 is also a very [i]hyped[/i] game.  Eight years of media cycle during the development of a complex game with a bunch of interwoven systems means that not everything that was promised was delivered.  I'm unfamiliar with the marketing campaign leading up to the release, having bought this based upon the marvelous world building of The Witcher 3 and avoided the hype to dodge potential spoilers.  

I see many complaints in the press at the time of writing which boil down to excessive hype for a game that had a rough launch.  I'm not surprised by either of these things.  CDPR is still young and even an old studio like Bethesda can't pull off a clean day-1 launch for an enormous RPG.  Marketing gets paid to sell copies of a game by hook or by crook and never gets held accountable by management for the consequences of straight up lying, so until we have a better mechanism for identifying marketing bullshit this is what we're going to get.  Want truth in marketing?  Burn corpo shit.

However, a rough launch and a dishonest advertising campaign are only temporary elements of the Cyberpunk story.  I recommend this game and I'll explain why below, but there are still a lot of bugs and you'll have to work around them if you play today.

[H1]Mechanics[/H1]
There are a lot of systems to interact with in Cyberpunk 2077.  First you have the inventory layer that every game has, items you're carrying around and wearing on your body.  Then you've got a cyberware inventory, a quickhack inventory, a shard inventory - all of which mostly manage themselves.  There are systems for network hacking, firearms, melee combat, stealth, vehicles, a social interface, the list goes on.  All these individual systems [i]mostly[/i] work as expected [i]most[/i] of the time which is an accomplishment in itself, but at the time of writing you'll still notice problems where these systems intersect.

That being said, nothing about the mechanical systems of the game is challenging after the first 20 or so levels.  It feels like there are three or more solutions to any given problem, which is great for ensuring that a player never comes across a challenge which they cannot overcome because of choices made earlier in the game.  It feels, again, like they went to great effort to ensure that there was not a quest in the game which you couldn't complete, whether you put all your points in one stat or spread them out.

Which is why I'm mystified by the conditions around the secret ending.  It's missable.  I missed it on my first playthrough.  Why would CDPR go to so much effort to make the entire game so totally accessible and then let you unwittingly lock yourself out of crucially important content?  I hesitate to encourage people to spoil themselves about any part of a game, but this one might be worth a google search if you only have time for one playthrough.

Having been through the whole thing both with a character that had max int/cool and min body/reflexes, and with another who had max body/reflexes and min int/tech, I feel that each system individually is well-balanced, but that seemingly any combination of systems makes the player overpowered.  I effortlessly one-shot whole packs of foes with my Blades character by using Standevistan to slow time, then sprinting around popping heads until Standevistan ends and all the bodies flop over at once.  This was a total rush the first few times.  Now it's a grey blur where I lazily blow up everything and spend more time moving the corpses around than actually interacting with anything in combat.  Similarly, my INT+COOL character can glance at a security camera from across the street, wiggle her fingers while her eyes shine blue for a while, and then go loot the facility since everyone's fallen over due to a barrage of fatal quickhacks.

So the game is very interesting currently, but not at all challenging.  Any build will work so no build is interesting enough to fiddle with or min/max because a 3-year-old putting points randomly into arbitrary skills and perks will get the same results.  This hampers the replayability because the question in RPGs typically comes down to ""Could I do as well if I did X"" and the answer from Cyberpunk is always a resounding yes, never a maybe, and certainly not a 'no'.

[H1]Narrative[/H1]

This is the golden element of the game, a story that reaches down and grabs you by the feelings and a cast of characters that run the gamut from the filthiest cyber-sleazebag to the warrior who sold his soul to the last remnants of freedom in a world where corporations rule their territory absolutely.  This cast as a whole upstaged Keanu Reeves and left his performance as Johnny feeling lackadaisical and muddy by comparison to the vibrant voice acting of other characters.  The voice acting and mocap across the main storyline quest and related companion side quests is consistently excellent.

I also have to praise the decision to go with fully voiced quest text for Gigs, the little side-jobs you do to level up or hunt for loot.  Gigs absolutely do get samey and repetitive after a while, because the building blocks used to make up the world are largely the same from one building to another and tasks boil down to interacting with an object for plot reasons to defeating an enemy for plot reasons and that is the full depth of the Gig system.  The voiceovers and little bits of narrative here are great, but they're few and far between and often not accompanied by much in the way of readable books or recorded conversations to help tell the story.

[H1]Summary[/H1]

I heaped praise on the story for writing, acting, and mocap, but lambasted the mechanics for lack of challenge, so where does that leave us?  Well, it's an excellent game to play once or twice.  It's great fun watching the story play out and the first few levels can be legitimately challenging.  For the best first-playthrough experience, I'd recommend sticking with the main story all the way to the clearly marked final quest warning and then cleaning up any sidequests you're interested in and picking your ending.  This should help avoid the bulk of the bugs and the bulk of the samey filler quests.

It's absolutely worth playing, but it's no replacement for a classic like Skyrim or Fallout: New Vegas when it comes to the replayability of the game overall."
1609895470,Only encountered three very minor bugs so far will update as progress is made.
1609895318,Really good game!!
1609895085,duh

1609894464,"Looking past all of the bugs, glitches and missing features that Cyberpunk 2077 has right now; this is, hands down, one of the best games I have ever played."
1609894423,"This is intended to be a spoiler free review for any who have not played through it yet, for those that have you should get what I am talking about.

I'm not often a reviewer, but figured I would add in my two cents. Firstly in case this runs on a bit long, TLDR: Yes this game has bugs and some flaws, however it is completely worth checking out.

There have been a lot of varying opinions on this game since it came out, the trend right now seems to be the doom and gloom crowd. This game at time can be a bit rough, buggy, and is apparent that some aspects were not fully worked out. In my time playing I have fallen through the map in an endless pit, I have been walking down the street and find my character launched clear over to the far end of the map to die in a splatter, I have accidentally killed targets by trying to set them down on the ground only to have them randomly explode in a bloody splatter, and I have found the stealth aspects to be an almost hit or miss in what enemies detect. 
-There have also been a few hiccups in some areas of the map where my frame rate will stutter (Delamain's HQ was one of the worst). Sadly, in the present day, you just kind of expect games to be released in this state and usually have it dealt with post launch in updates. 
-Dialogue between characters can be sketchy sometimes, especially in calls to Judy, there tends to be this weird awkward silence then  V's random response, it can also get a bit repetitive for some side characters, not to mention a lot of times texts and response on phone can get a bit jumbled (esp Regina's). 
-I'm listing driving here, but it is manageable, for me I'd rank it as, not as bad as Watch Dogs, but not as good as GTA IV, its like someone intentionally dipped your rear tires in lube, unless you are on a bike, in which case its basically two basketballs and a motor. Pedestrian AI ties in with this, I forget if it was a previous GTA or Saint's Row game, but the pedestrians have a tendency to leap into your vehicles path instead of out it when trying to ""avoid"" you. 

All that being said, there is so much that CDPR did right or amazingly well in this game. First off, the writers did one hell of an amazing job. The story is for the most part solid (yes there are some small nitpicks, but none worth going over in my mind.) If one just plays the main story line, it can be considered a bit short, but honestly there are so many noteworthy side missions in this game that I find myself lost in them sometimes. 
-For the most part the characters are well written, some of the standouts  for me were Jackie, Vik, Panam and Judy. They did miss the mark on some of them in my opinion (looking at you River ya damned dead fish), but the good in my opinion far outweighs the bad. I feel like they did a good job in nailing character emotions in this game (my biggest example would be to have you watch Jackie in the soundproof booth during the Heist planning part, he goes from chilled bravado to straight up nervous when he gets certain details about your target, I remember the first time through I noticed at a certain point that Jackie was annoying the hell out of me suddenly, on my next replay realized why and when it happened.) Another stand out in amazing emotional ranges is during that one darker ending. They really nailed making characters that you find yourself invested in, instead of just background noise. 
-Guns and their animations (reloads, shooting, etc) were done really well and there is a nice variety to them. 
-There are so many amazing visuals in this game, the city skyline, vehicles, and the visual differences in some of the neighborhoods just to mention a few.

So bottom line, did they have a good launch of this title, in all honesty no, they should have let it bake a bit longer. I'm sure corporate greed won out though to get that sweet sweet holiday release. Is it worth the buy, in my opinion yes. For as much as there is wrong in this game they did so so much right and that needs to be acknowledged. Time will tell if this will be the next big comeback since No Man's Sky, personally I think they can pull it off and am eager to see what else they have in store."
1609894269,good game has a few bugs here and there nothing is a game breaker
1609894246,"So much left to be desired. I really wanted to like this but there is just so much wrong here. The game play is basic at best compared to other open world titles. Anyone who says otherwise are lying to themselves. So many reviews out there pointing out the obvious, which is that is an unfinished game. I'm sure as this game rolls along it will get updates and improvements but damn 8 years for this? If you look at what was promised to what we actually have this game is a huge disappointment."
1609894192,"106 hours played with maybe 7 of them really good. The rest was a painfully average experience excluding the countless bugs, glitches, corrupted saves, and other technical issues. Perhaps one day they'll all be ironed out, by CDProjectRed or the community, but I still wouldn't recommend this game unless they really loved the genre. In the meantime check out the Far Cry 3 expansion Blood Dragon"
1609894152,"This game takes place in a world that is pretty much in line with what I expected from the gritty cyberpunk world described in the Sprawl series by William Gibson, although I am not sure he agrees with this himself. The gritty street smart trash. Everything is either cutting edge, or on the edge of going to shit. 

I revisit all the novels I read in my teenage years and still sometimes re-read, like the works by PKD or John Brunner's Shockwave Rider, the original Ghost In the Shell anime/manga, Stephenson's Snow Crash -, I love this stuff, and I love the references I encounter. I am thoroughly enjoying this game.

For the game, the gameplay is nice, I particularly love the Brain Dance part they have added which really adds great value to the game and the stories. In the beginning I had some trouble with the vehicles, especially motorcycles, but as you progress you get some better cars that also handle better. The only thing I did not like in the entire game is the minimap when driving (it doesn't zoom out or something, so I overshoot a lot of roads), all the other stuff is compensated many times over by the good parts and aspects of the game.

""`You got it. Corporate core data for Tessier-Ashpool S.A., and that ice is generated by their two friendly AI's. On par with anything in the military sector, looks to me.

1609895497,"Well I was one of the people who were hyped by the OG trailer back in 2013. After watching the 2018 trailer i was like ""Let's GO"", then 2020 happened and the Gameplay leaks were online. I was a hater at that point after seeing bugs, bad optimisation and an overall glitchy game. I was still buying it but thought i was gonna refund immediately. I can say now after 114 Hours that i enjoyed this game a lot. Glitches and bugs making the game funny while at the same time enraging at points, Gameplay is superior to BugSnax and Story isn't something I've seen before giving it a +. 

Moral of the story is If a game looks bad when shown from consoles..... chances are the Developers really made it for PC. Thats a YIKEZ!"
1609894087,the game looks great love how it sucks you in the  story takes a minute to really pick but once it does your in for an great adventure that has a few stand out moments.  Creating V was really a good time lots of options and for all the time i have in the game its been spent on doing half n half campaign questing and side quests all of which have been enjoyable combat and weapons feel good lots of ways to build V. i have seen a few glitches nothing game breaking as of this moment and i look forward to many many more hours
1609894037,"If you're a fan of the cyberpunk genre, of FPS games, and role-playing games in general, definitely give this game a playthrough. Recommend it on PC, though.

If you're not a fan of the cyberpunk, dystopic, FPS/RPG genres, or of computer games in general.... why are you reading this review?"
1609893898,"I played half on a 780ti and half on a 3080. I can confidently say that either 1080p medium or 1440p ultra + RTX this is a fantastic experience. This is the most I've genuinely cared about a story in a game I can remember. The actual gameplay is good but definitely not the main attraction. 

This isn't as much an RPG in terms of controlling the outcome of the story compared to other games however the character arcs explored throughout the game really left an impression and I'll be genuinely sad when I finish.

Don't read guides, don't worry about min/maxing just enjoy an amazing character driven experience."
1609893844,"So i have tried my best to get into this game, but for some reason the main story line just doesn't hold my attention at all. I had a few bugs but nothing game breaking so i can't even use that as an excuse. I just don't find V or Silverhand to be interesting at all. I am at the quest marked ""point of no return"" which i assume is the final quest in the main story but i have zero interest in finishing it. 

Despite the main story line not holding my attention at all, i will say the side missions of some of the side quests to be far superior to anything ive done in the main quest line."
1609893762,!
1609893615,good game
1609893605,"This game is a TON of fun. I got lost in this world for a good week or so and didn't want to put it down. Yes there are countless bugs but for me they were mostly minor, nothing game breaking."
1609893540,"Rocky launch, but if your computer has the chops to run it, it's really fun. While not a perfect game by any stretch of the term, there's plenty to love. I played through as a stealthy hacker and am halfway through a mantis blades run, and the game is definitely much more suited for the latter, but fans of stealth can definitely have a good time. Just expect to lean on those hacks a lot more than any stealth skills, since there really aren't any. The story is the absolute high point of the game, and there are tons of completely optional quests that will suck you in. 

The driving isn't very good, and  some of the city systems that were advertised aren't quite up to snuff, but if you treat the game more like the Witcher than GTA, you'll have a better time. Don't expect your life path to matter much, and the story decisions that actually matter mostly hit near the end. V is a distinct character like Geralt, too. There are some opportunities to craft a character (how V responds to Johnny, whether they drink, how they treat corporations, for example), but for the most part, V will act like V.

If you're on the fence, wait out some of the inevitable patches and grab it for a discount, but if you're thinking you want to play it, there's plenty of fun to be had,"
1609893521,Buggie mess with a ton of missing content but it's still pretty fun to play aside from the almost non existent A.I.
1609893393,they're not bugs they're features
1609893325,"Bugs aside, this game is a masterpiece.  The soundtrack is beautiful and the story without any spoilers is gut wrenching.  You feel for these characters.  You fall in love with them, you want them to win, you want to destroy the bad guys.  Most of all, you are rooting for V.

Look past the bugs because when they are finally fixed, this game is beyond perfect."
1609893324,"Best game of 2020 for me, the developers maybe should have released it as a beta or something but personally for me i have not had any game ruining bugs only small things that are not bothersome, if dont like it at first just keep playing and getting into the story. for me it wasnent all that interesting at first but man now i can say that it is one of my favorite story mode single player rpg."
1609893249,"I really enjoyed this game, but the game-breaking bugs really ruined it for me, I still got plenty of hours in and expect to come back whenever they release a large DLC. I feel as if I can expect to see the game improve performance and patched bugs in the future."
1609893215,"amazing game fun times
"
1609893209,GREATEST GAME EVER
1609893144,"You know I was going to give this game a chance. I spent 125 hours on all the side missions before taking the point of no return mission. You know, the one it tell you to do all the side stuff? Well guess what? There's a part with an unskippable on rails drone segment that KEEPS F'ING CRASHING IN THE SAME F'ING PLACE EVERY F'ING TIME! The game had only crashed on me once before. Sure it have bugs up the anus but nothing game braking. UNTIL THE FINAL F'ING MISSION AFTER I DID ALL THE OTHER CONTENT! Go to hell CDPR! I guess there wasn't any play testers in that sweatshop of yours!"
1609893139,This is one of the most broken games I have ever played. Most fun I've had with a game all year!
1609893121,"Wake the Fuck up Samurai, we got a glitchy game to play."
1609893101,"The are glitches and bugs, but it's a very good game overall. 8.5/10"
1609893046,"7/10: A good start but needs plenty of time for balancing and polish. Needs more variety in mission objectives and approach, never really felt like my choices for character mattered either in combat or plot terms. Story is very short, unless CDPR is experimenting with a new ""2 act structure."" Surprising submission from the company that crafted the Witcher 3, they probably knew better. Shame.

fyi I have completed the game as much as one can in a single playthrough but in my experience, 250 hrs to complete a playthrough is pretty short. By this I mean, all map and journal missions completed. Clear. Compared to Skyrim or GTA this was definitely shorter.

1609892729,"Its in Alpha, not finished, minimun requirements are bullshit and if you dont have a 1080 ti or better your game will look like shit at 45 fps, specially when driving or any kind of fast movement. Yeah the concept its great, and probably one day it will be a good game, it's just.... Soooo muuuch content got cut off, I finished it back to back, all side quests all misions all everything and I can tell so much was cut from it, its badly paced becase huge chuncks of it are missing. You are introduced for 2 hrs to the world slowly and nice, with amazin story telling and ok gameplay and then everything goes to shit after that.. Weird coincidence that the game is good for just like the 2 hrs, and also Steam refund policy only lasts 2 hrs of gameplay....  Oh yeah, and also lots of buggs and very shity interface lol."
1609892690,Its crazy thru all the bugs.. and how broken it was its got me feeling some type of way the game was so fucking good.
1609892548,amazing
1609892536,"Look, we've all read the reviews about how terrible this game is because of the bugs. and i will admit, there are some interesting bugs both hilarious and irritating. However, ON PC, this game has been great. The bugs I've encountered have been pretty basic and none altering the game play. The story is incredible and at the time of writing this I only have one ending. That's how lost you can get in this world. I've been itching for a new single player RPG and cyberpunk delivered in my book."

1609892295,"WHY I LOVE CYBERPUNK

As many others i preordered Cyberpunk because of the trust i had in them after i played the Witcher Series. I respected their decision to postpone the game multiple times and expected bad things when players demanded the game to not be postponed any further. And as everyone can see i expected correctly. The NPC´s are idiots, there are bugs which make the game seem almost alpha state like and sometimes you even have to reload a checkpoint to be able to finish a mission. You all already know these problems. I have played almost every single mission in the game and almost every end you can play and i LOVE THIS GAME. When you are able to jump above your own shadow and see past the bugs the story emerges around you, pulling you deep into its core. During the past years as i was growing up, i lost my love to video games, because i just didn´t want to pour hours into playing and grinding and other games just did´nt catch me enough to keep playing them. Even during the pandemic i wouldn´t enjoy playing games as much as i used to. But once i was able to play Cyberpunk i lost myself in it. Not just the Main- but even the sidestory feel important and catchy. The graphics are astonishing and the Sidecharacters make me want to play the sidemissions even more. CDPR obviously could have done some things different but EVERY OTHER DEVELOPER IN THE WORLD wouldn´t have even gotten the game as good as they have. I enjoyed every second of the Game and look forward to fixes and new content which CDPR will surely provide, just as they did in the past.

I apologize for mistakes, as english is not my native tongue and look forward to open discussions."
1609892108,"Great references to the original TTRPGs. As a longtime cyberpunk, I love it."
1609894951,"[B]GEEZ[/B], I don't even know from where to start writing about this failure, over hyped mess ever, a completely disappointment, a false advertising product all over it, not immersive at all & theee buggs (ohh God, don't even wanna go in that direction) or the minimum specs (don't even try run it with that, it wont work, barely works on some high 1k$+ configurations)... and not to mention that i even preorder it   #big-facepalm.

It looks like not even a mediocre game, except the glittering, fancy textures, ""cool"" graphics (but who cares because that's how it should look a game in 2020+), some other good details here & there and sex/porn ads almost everywhere in game (which seems it's still a must in almost every game, of course you can adjust your thingie btw the legs and hide nipples in character creation but that's it you can't customise the character anymore after this point in game).

To many broken physics, collisions, animations, horrible warrant system & i think the worst Ai I've seen in decades and even if the game wasn't so broken it would be mediocre at best. They attempted to copy several successful games and did it poorly. The ""game"" is completely trash, one of the worse games i've ever played. Its like a bad GTA (there is no such thing) set in the future, but like it was made in the past 20 years ago at best just wrapped in fancy textures, a bs wrapped in gold.

I stopped to play after few hours, i simply can't do it and continue atm or i would start cry of how bad it is but i wont refund it either bcs i'll be waiting for fixes, patches, updates and so on which to make the game enjoyable and playable and actually what Cdpr promised and massive advertised for almost 2 years now. Oh wait, they at least succeed with one thing: ""Whole game is going to be a meme"". - Jul 2, 2018 - source: @CyberpunkGame Twitter.

There are endless reviews of this & that, some on point some not, with negative & positive sides of this game (which imho is not a game but it feels like a story walk simulator where actually there are no big changes you could do, just a lot of blabla you can select. They made it sound like you had so many choices, could do so many things, and it's just not. Plus a bad script of the Keanu one which make him sound horrible and act the same just because of a bad writing.. poor guy.. and his character in game geez what's wrong with his head made it so big ffs).

The gameplay and the world is absolutely empty and dull, streets sometimes are empty (in a futuristic overpopulated area). Don't mind the bugs, performance issues. Don't mind the lackluster buggy cinematics. Don't mind the HIDEOUS INTERFACE. The absolute terrible inventory system. Don't mind that you can't buy cars from a shop or website (doesn't exist), or other stuffs in game like to customise your character and do funny stuffs in this amazing looking city. Don't mind the horrible way of getting side-quests through tireless phone calls, and when you kill the person you were sent there to kill and leave the building the NPC calls you back INSTANTLY, magically knowing about it, before anyone else could find about body or known the target was really killed (can mention here the police that spawns close to you out of no where as well). Don't mind the uncountable times I have been cut from the immersion because so many weird things were happening on the screen, and don't mind the NPC when having a cutscene with deciding to walk through me as if I didn't exist, NUMEROUS times, even when I stood right where the cutscene left me, after giving back the control.

This game is an absolute MESS. I could not believe my eyes. The game gives you a glimpse of what it could've been because it has COOL cinematics while having a drink at the bar, and getting your cybernetic arm upgrades on a cool cutscene, but then it NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. Everytime you upgrade your cybernetic stuff, it's just one horrible menu with stupid icons. Everytime you ask for a drink, a horrible menu opens up so you can buy random uninpressive food icons that all work the same way. And everytime you want to eat something you already have, you have to open your inventory, instead of pushing a button like it is in other games. The food & drinks are definitely disappointing, no point in interacting with it if it's just a regular consumable. No special animations or just dialogue with the bartenders or anything.

First time you carry a body, they show a cool cinematic of laying it on the ground, on your very first mission. But then, forever after, everytime you have to put a body in the trunk of a car, they teleport. NPCs don't even open any doors, ever. NPC's don't open or interact with anything, ever! When they enter a car, the door opens by itself, and I know the door is not automatic because when YOU leave the car, you interact with the door knob. And the NPCs clip THROUGH the door when it's opening or closing, instead of waiting for it. The car usually starts running off before they even sit or put the foot on it. Doors are not physical objects like in GTA for example where you can destroy it detach it from the car if you hit something, here in the amazing CYBERPUNK 2077 it clips through everything !!!

This game "" is "" one of the most immersion braking games and i try being impartial here, forgetting about the hype, threating it like any other game, looking over all the bugs glitches and clunky NPC and bad cutscenes it has, not comparing to anything else, and just looking at it for what it is. And it is absolutely stupid and flatout boring and lacking an infinite of stuffs which should not miss from this game! This game it's really insulting, an open world utter trash, period. Ohh, and why since is MADE IN POLAND, doesn't represent a city from Europe and had to be typical american style one another copycat city-game from NA ?!

I stop here for now better, definitely devs need to do a SERIOUS quality of life update for this game, no wonder they delayed it 2000 times, this game looks at least rushed even if they ""work"" on it for years (if advertising counts as that too), it should not had been released but i believe we all know why it happened in the end, they possible left short on money because of the massive advertising and they released it as we see it.

In the end, no matter of the score game have here & there, critic reviews and idk what else that promote still positive hype about this game, it seems like the advertising fake propaganda is still going on.

Wish i could give it from all my being a huge thumbs up but i can't, i'm not a hypocrite like others and to give a fake review to be part of the false advertising. It is still a 60 euro product and for those which actually care of them hard working earn money i would give them the advise to wait for fixes & updates OR buy it and refund it before 2 hours of ""gameplay"" but considering that the prologue here is at least 2h+ be carefull with that, maybe they did it on purpose so long so could not be refunded after, really tricky this detail too...

If you don't care about all of the mentioned stuffs here (only a little part of them) of course the game could be an interesting experience and look awesome (which it does.. LOOK) but pretty much that's it sadly. The potential is still existing and that's a big hope still!"
1609891957,"I honestly dont know the right words to describe this game.

It's been years since i last felt this much for a character in a game. There is so much going on during the game, and so many threads that weaves together towards the end. I adore this game to an extent i never would've thought. And sure, it is a rocky ride some times with close to game breaking bugs, glitches that makes me have to replay a mission time and time again. But i would honestly do it all again, just to be able to be part of Night-city once more. The story enthralls me, the lore binds me, and the relationship with the carachers makes me fall in love. I cried my eyes out on the Endings... all of them... And after enough time, i will wipe my tears again from this masterpiece of a game."
1609891931,"This could have been something great, instead it felt more like a generic RPG at times. 
I enjoyed my playthrough, I enjoyed the story very much, even tho the main missions were quite short. And surprisingly I found myself enjoying the combat very much too.
Now, with that being said, the game that was released was not the game that was promised, not by a long shot. At its current stage, I wouldn't recommend to anyone who have been waiting for this. If you just want to try this out, then sure, you will have a lot of fun. If you have been waiting for this for years.. wait another year, supposedly they are slowly adding the cut content back, if that's the case, in a year or so, this will be an amazing game."
1609891904,"At times you can see where the devs just did not have enough time to finish something. Sometimes there are bugs (for me VERY rarely and no gamebreaking so far).

I believe in CDPR and that they will fix the bugs and further develop the game. While it may not have been the best game on release, it WILL be the best game 2021, I have no doubt."
1609891818,IT IS Breathtaking
1609891611,"Purchased the game on day 1 and had high hopes.... even after the initial backlash.. I had faith CDPR will patch and fix the game, unfortunately the game is still full of BUGS and just not intuitive AI.. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! 
DO NOT BUY!"
1609891602,Visually impressive. Getting 40-50 frames most of the time on a 2080 with ultra graphics and ray tracing on. Lots of bugs but nothing out of the ordinary for a new release. There were a couple of instances where I had to reload a previous save to fix a bug. The main story line seemed a little short and half-assed to me but there is lots of other stuff to do in the city. Combat is kind of easy. The city is extremely detailed; you'll walk around for a while just looking at stuff. I hope the developer can iron out the bugs and add more content in the future.
1609891326,"TO CDPR's ADMINISTRATION & MANAGEMENT: Go and **** yourself

This game, has the potential to become a masterpiece, but due to chaotic development management, it lost this opportunity forever. Though the story is still good, unfinished contents and countless bugs destroyed this game. Even, DLCs in the future can be a remedy to some extent, It can't reach the height it should have reached."
1609891318,"This game is amazing. Sure, there are a few bugs sometimes. Despite that, though, the story of this game, the characters, and the city itself are so rich. The side quests are interesting and not just generic radiant or fetch quests. I hope that even though this game has had a lot of criticism put towards it that people still play it because it is a wonderful experience."
1609891926,"This game is so frustrating because it has all the signs of potential greatness. There are complex plot lines, interesting characters, a good mix of story and action. Open world that doesn't feel empty, nice visual style. The combat mechanics are decent even though it feels like a somewhat poorly executed Mass Effect copycat. Also, it's a complete shit show from a game stability perspective. I have hardware well above the minimum, but I still regularly get 40 fps on the lowest graphic settings. My game crashes probably four or five times each play session. Sometimes it's like ""Oh, I guess that way point loading causes my game to crash, maybe I'll try to walk there instead of fast travelling..."" The story elements are good individually, but they didn't spend the time to weave them together in a way that makes a lot of sense. For example, one part of the game that was fairly ""on rails"" ended and another more open part began. This initiated like 15 texts/calls from new characters I had never met all giving me new and disjointed side quests. I kind of felt like, ""Who are all these people? Did I know them before? How did they have my number? Why are they calling me now after this important plot element that would probably make me out of touch with my network instead of in demand?"" It's like they developed all these side quests individually but ran out of time to integrate them into the larger narrative so they just dump 'em on you all at once. That, and the main quest line feels a bit forced from a big picture perspective with lots of plot holes and rushed character development.
If the game were more stable and crashed less, I would be willing to recommend paying the full $60 despite some of the other hiccups... But honestly, this game feels like a Beta edition and not a full product. Maybe wait till it's on sale in 6 or 8 months for 40 bucks and has a few more patches come out."
1609891177,"buggy, but there is a great game going on here."
1609983912,My views on this game have changed recently as i have been enjoying it more and with the recent patch the game works much smoother.

This would be the one. CD RED has done it again in my book. I will say this game is very detailed so don't let a young kid play this......... But one more thing, Enjoy and don't say I did not warn you. You will get lost in this game.........Hopefully you will enjoy those hours like I will........"

Would recommend even in its current state, and things will only get better from here."
1609889767,"I tried to like this game, little bugs became an issue too many times. Wish that they didn't have to be but when the little things would set you back it was exhausting doing the same steps over and over. By the time I finished the story I felt short changed, and wanting more from it. The game HAS potential  but until annoying bugs are ironed out, it will remain in the shadow of the games before it"

1609889601,"Cyberpunk is a joke. Ill admit I am a CDPR fan boy. And ill also admit that this attempt at entertainment is a steaming turd. There is not one thing about this game that makes it worth wasting time on. The game looks good, sometimes. Like when the textures randomly dont load and ur looking at a street full of mud people. Driving a car is pointless as they cannot be controlled by humans. Combat is as shallow as the cheap veneer that we are supposed to believe is a vibrant city full of life. Games 20 years ago had better AI than this mess. 
Everyone keeps saying that it can be fixed with patches. Have you ever seen a dog turd get better with age? This game is not a fine wine waiting to mature it is a stinking corpse that should be buried and forgotten.
I feel bad for all the folks that put so much effort into this title only to have CDPR execs release the worst game of 2020. Cyberpunk 2077 is the corona virus of games. Dont spread this disease of a title"
1609889515,"game is pretty incredible...on PC.

I've heard the complaints, they are real. But i'm having so much fun with this game its awesome. If you want to wait a few months for the bugs to be ironed out go for it more power to you. 

Gun play feels great 
Customization is really cool
Graphics are superb (if you have the hardware for it)

Yeah its a bit buggy
Yeah it feels a bit rushed

BUT it'll only get better with time, hopefully this helps.

1609889343,fun
1609889287,"I really enjoyed the game. To be fair, I had no expectations coming into the game. I had only seen a few trailers. The bugs were not too bad for me. I would have wished the background you chose affected the story more. The police suck. But the game is beautiful. I thought Keanu Reeves performance was great. I was able to really immerse myself in Night City. I chose the Johnny Silverhand ending, and it was really hard to choose V or Johnny. Moral of the story Good but disapointing game. I heard that a lot of updates and DLC are coming this year so looking forward to it."
1609889193,Game still needs a lot... and A LOT of fixes to be playable for immersion. but once it is there i can see it possibly being a favourite.

I didn't have anymore bread. This is how Cyberpunk felt to me. I was so excited and ready for my pb&j and then just mold.

I have logged about 100 hours with this game and have very much enjoyed it. But holy shit does it have bugs and holy shit does it benefit from a beefy rig. It's badly in need of a patch to affect QoL, glitches, and other issues."
1609967408,"Oh Cyberpunk 2077, what a meme you are.

Now with 89 hours into the game and with patch 1.06, I decided to finish the story for the first time.
It is a good and a bad game. Many aspects of the game are not even close to 2020 release standards.

Gotta start up stating it's the most beautiful looking game I've ever played. Although it runs like crap time to time even with decent hardware (3700X, RTX3080, ultrawide) when Ray tracing + other goodies turned on.
I don't know how many hours I sank only taking photos with the editor...yeah, it's breathtaking.

Gameplay is (go to Panam ;) somewhat decent action adventure filled with bugs and glitches everywhere. Some of them are even hilarious as many of you have seen on forums. Glitches are not that bad and gamebreaking on PC compared to console versions.
Sadly it's NOT an RPG which it supposed to be. It heavily relies on gunplay and hacking. Not much of interaction with the gameworld itself that might result into something bigger. You can't do much in Night City other than cruise around running errands, shoot bad guys, collect loot.. and of course enjoy the view. The lack of things you can do to amuse yourself is not maybe a bad thing.. like who wants to go bowling, or throw darts for example. So I guess it's okay..
 
There are different gang factions and starting background you can choose, but they mainly are ""just there"" for somewhat illusion. The beginning is unique for each Nomad, Streetkid and Corpo but mostly turns into same(ish) gameplay experience. Gang members go for enemies you just kill for XP and loot. I thought you could build up rep and run into gang wars but no..

Story wise the game delivers emotionally strong and captivating story for me at least. If you are planning to only play main missions, then the game is very short. You are granted gigs and side missions from various characters in Night City as you progress, that somewhat affect the story (only specific ones though).  In the end the errands are eventually starting to repeat themselves since they basically are killings or thievery type of jobs. Keeps you entertained for a while though.

The biggest bummer for me is that AI is completely braindead (if there's any) and the spawning cop/wanted system is just fucked up. They don't give a shit if someone is shooting or fighting in front of them, unless it's a scripted event. Civilians wont stand up for themselves if you beat/rob them and are just for decoration basically (you can't have GTA like fun). If you blow up bunch of cars you'll be gunned down instantly by cops spawing outta your asshole.
I think most of the development time went to building the gorgeous large map and not so much on the code itself.

It's hard to put this review into few words since it has lot to give in good and bad but overall I like it. Eagerly wait for CDPR to release more content for it."
1609887655,"Don't fall for the hate this game received on launch. Cyberpunk 2077 is a phenomenal game. I'm on my third play-through, and I'm still having a blast 130 hours later."
1609887655,"Pretty immersive for this type of game. Alot of people complain about the length of the main story, but once you get lost in the side quests and relationships the actual length of play is much longer. The game stays pretty faithful to the feel of the tabletop roleplaying game without being too crunchy for the layperson. there are a handful of semi-illicit scenes that really are pretty tame, but all the background bombardment may not be suitable for younger players."
1609887633,"If you can get past all the bugs, and really bad optimization, then you got a really good game, with a fantastic story. Driving really sucks tho. Ever played roblox? It's a bit like that. Otherwise, great game!

PS. Voodoo Boys, more like Poopoo Boys"
1609887492,"CYBERPUNK 2077 REVIEW

HIGHLIGHTS

*8/10
*Single player only
*Lengthy Storytelling
*Body Modifications & Cool Weapons
*Police are broken in the game.

As one of the most anticipated games of the year this game came to the party with high expectations.

I have to say it hit the mark in some parts and fell down in others. While the game play itself is very reminiscent of games like GTA5 and Watchdogs it still managed to deliver something unique and fun to play with body modifications, unique vehicles and weapons such as auto locking bullets. 

The only downside for me personally was the extensive storytelling. While I usually enjoy engaging in the story of a game I found this game had way to many cut scenes and often I was left with a feeling of ""UMMMM....OKAY......Can I please play now??"". While there is a fast forward feature you can use I found it hard to fast forward too quickly as to not make an incorrect decision in the game when offered two ways to go in the story.

OVERALL: This game is unique, beautiful on a good PC and downright fun to play. While the occasional glitch, lengthy storytelling and the police just (RANDOMLY) popping into the space I'm in was very annoying, it wasn't enough to ruin the game. I would still highly recommend this game to the community for hours of fun."
1609887333,"This game is just a big bug, if you are able to boot the game then you are treated to the worst experience of your entire life. If you like playing a dumpster fire this game is for you. I would recommend you take the $60 you were gonna pay for this game and shit in a bag and send it to CD Project. It will be as good as the joke they tried to play on you for trying to have you purchase this trash."
1609967679,"*NO SPOILERS* 

This game has been very enjoyable for me. It has captivated me emotionally in ways that most games do not; I found myself laughing, crying, getting angry, or delighted amongst many other emotions while playing it. If you really don't want to play it until it has been optimized better, then don't - that is totally understandable - and I must warn you that as of right now, if you do not have a high end PC, textures and hair will be grainy and pixelated (it is not unbearable for me, although it is definitely noticeable and can be a little frustrating at first if you're very concerned with aesthetics), and you probably will not be able to do much to correct this issue until the devs have fixed it. However, beneath its rough launch and exterior on most platforms, CP2077 has the makings of masterpiece material, imperfect as it may be at the moment, and this can only become more true as improvements continue to be made. I am taking my time playing this game, and I highly suggest that you ignore the toxicity surrounding its release to form your own opinions of its worth, free from being influenced by the drama. 

If you want to play a game that offers you a crazy amount of choice (for example, you definitely can complete a lot of missions in very different ways, which may be directly connected to dialogue choices, your physical actions/choices, or to which attributes you invest points in), always manages to present you with meaningful and enjoyable questlines, along with some enjoyable ARPG gameplay (which can either be fast or slow paced, FPS-driven or stealth-driven, depending on your style), then this game is for you. At its core, it is a wonderfully done game, and I'm sure I will feel that way even more once it has been optimized further. It also manages to comment on the USA's current political climate in an artistic and creative way without outright insulting either side; however, it also manages to show many of the faults and shortcomings on BOTH sides. Without working together and trying to understand each other's point of view, we will never solve anything, and our world will eventually become akin to the one we see displayed throughout the story and world of Cyberpunk."
1609887226,"2 words: Dead World. I don't mind the bugs, i just can't get any imersion playing in a dead world. I remember when i played skyrim, yes there were bugs, some game breaking ones, but the imersion and a alive world makes u go on, cyberpunk is the oposite, everytime i'm out of a dialogue of a quest and i look around or drive, everyone is dead in the brains, i just can't.. xD (maybe i'm spoiled with games like skyrim, gta or red dead II) in the present its a bad game for me. In the future... ?! i dunno , maybe they will make the game great, but now i already lost money for a game i don't enjoy and can't finish a playthrough because of it."
1609886995,"The alternate dialogue options dont result in anything different.  The bonus endings are only the result of dialogue from 2-3 side and story quests.  There are some excellent story driven side quests, but overall the city lacks activities to do.  You cant rampage versus the police, they either one shot you with explosions or you kill so many of them that they run out of police and stop spawning or the opposite they spawn non stop squads directly on top of you.  You dont get to work with any of the gangs, you simply murder them on sight, and the police are cool with it. Just dont stand next to a cop on traffic duty or he'll assume you are a blood thirsty jay walker and assassinate you on sight. 

Rush through the story and be done with this game, this game lacks the city activities of GTA and barely scratches the story telling of Witcher."
1609886909,"In 2020, what does it take to lose all the reputation and credibility that you’ve gained throughout the years? – [strike]getting caught[/strike] releasing a buggy mess of a game, that is barely a half of the game you promised…
Aaand getting caught with it.

[list]
[*]Overview
CP2077, in its current state at least, ends up as an RPG with a relatively huge and beautiful open world; with a ton of side content, but laughably short and linear main story. Gameplay-wise it reminds me of Fallout 4 or smth along these lines; a bit more fun and dynamic at times, but equally bugged and broken balance-wise. Actually, scratch that - it’s a mixture of Fallout 4 progression, combat and open world with dumb NPCs, Deus Ex stealth and Watch Dogs hacking mechanics.
And all of that multilayered cake is generously glazed with bugs, performance issues, and riddled with holes of cut content.
[*]Story
On one hand, the story and overall narration are phenomenal. Voice acting is top notch, cutscenes direction is great, and the mockup actors did a fantastic job. At times, I found myself so immersed that I even tried to simulate my character’s head movement via mouse. And sometimes I slowed down my pace, whether in car or on foot, just to enjoy the world’s atmosphere.
On the other hand - this is supposed to be an RPG, not a linear story. What was advertised was YOUR story, the story of YOUR character climbing the ranks in Night City, choosing who they wish to become as they progress. What we got, however, is a short story that constantly tries to rush you narratively, telling you that you’re constantly in a race against the clock (you aren’t). It also tries to make it a story about your relationship with one of the characters, but the issue is - despite seemingly numerous choices that supposedly affect said relationship, the only choices that actually matter are: 1) whether you complete this character’s questline and 2) what choices will you make during the final mission.
[*]Gameplay
Visually beautiful and detailed, multilevel city, filled to the brim with completely retarded NPCs. Seriously, if you ever thought that AI and traffic behavior in GTA or Watch Dogs were underwhelming, boy does this game have some news for you.
Overall, an okay-ish FPS with some neat tricks up its sleeve, but with a standard RPG leveling. Got into some area way too early? - Get ready to pump several tons of bullets into some elite enemy’s head. Want to make a full-melee build? - Go ahead, but what’s the point of melee combat in an FPS?
TES/Fallout inspired progression. In other words, you have to do/use particular stuff to level the corresponding skill tree. Some are simple and straightforward: use handguns to level up handgun handling/use rifles or SMGs to level up assault weapon tree. But some trees… Boy… Want to level up engineering? - Don’t just use Tech weapons - only kill enemies behind cover with charged shots. Wish to level up crafting? - Well, recall your days of blacksmithing 100500+ daggers in Skyrim and start crafting Epic rarity med kits… Only to learn that, apparently, nobody tested the crafting system and you can literally break the game’s economy via crafting, since you can get limitless resources (and, by extension - money) by dismantling certain items that you just crafted. The most annoying part is that there’s close to no point in upgrading items, since recrafting them is far more beneficial. Which, sadly, makes the Iconic items more of a nuisance, since most of them can’t be crafted more than once.,
Hacking and stealth - imagine a Deus Ex and Watch Dogs hybrid. Nuff said. Luckily, you’re almost never forced to go for a stealth approach, so you can just say discard your hacking capabilities and get yourself some other powerful combat implant, instead. Be advised, though - there will be some mission that you physically CANNOT COMPLETE without hacking, regardless of your skill., so you’ll have to visit Ripperdocs and change your implants from time to time.
Finally, cars. No customization; neither visual nor performance. Driving is… horrible, plain and simple. Calling up your vehicle has a 50/50% chance of it reaching you half-broken, due to dumb spawns.
 [*]Graphics
The visuals are… Umm… I don’t know - at certain points, they are amazing. The level design is, again, phenomenal most of the time. The game shows that a buttload of time and effort were put into it. But given the current state of CP2077 from the technical perspective… this picture gets occasionally ruined by some stupid bug way too often. Entire fields of garbage, flowing in mid-air; cars spawning half-broken, flying full speed into space; numerous issues with NPCs, both visual and collisions-related… It’s just hard to give any definitive verdicts.
[*]Sound
Luckily, some minor audio issues aside, everything is nearly perfect when it comes to sound in CP2077. Soundtrack is incredible; voice acting is, like mentioned before, top-notch, and the SFX quality is fairly decent, as well. My only complaint is that there are only two combat tracks that you get to hear in unscripted fights.
[/list]

[h1] Conclusion[/h1]
9/10 potential, but 6/10 in its current state:
-1 for false advertising and rushing the game when it clearly wasn’t ready for release.
-1 for numerous technical issues.
-1 for a ton of cut content, surprisingly short main story, and very limited RPG potential.
-1 for certain ridiculous balancing issues with economy, combat and progression.

With that in mind, I’m putting this game to rest until it’s finally updated to the state that is at least somewhat close to what has been promised to us during all these years. I will gladly give it another chance and update my review if CDPR manages to get out of the shitstorm that they wittingly unleashed, but naturally, my trust in them is completely compromised."
1609886814,"Einfach zu viele Bugs. 
Kann ich aktuell leider nicht empfehlen."
1609886762,"This game is unplayable even on a PC unless you have a super computer. My somewhat gaming quality laptop is at the lowest possible settings for EVERYTHING even implemented several ""fixes"" found online and was unable to get the game to be playable. There is a near half second input lag (which I didn't even know was possible on a directly connect PC not sending the data over the internet) making my reactions so slow it's impossible to enjoy any fights I get into.
And steam won't refund because I left the game on or spent too much time in the settings menus trying to fix my issues and my time shows I played more than 2 hours so... I'll wipe my digital behind with this game and delete it. Never will I purchase a game from steam again."
1609886756,It's breathtaking an an awesome play
1609886865,"The story is beautiful, the visuals are breathtaking, and if you have a rig or console that can run it, try it. Don't listen to the haters, try it out and form your own opinion."
1609886707,"A buggy, rushed, broken, mess of a game.... but it's glorious compared to a dozen of the other ""AAA"" releases over the last ten years this has been in development.

I'd take this over damn near everything i've played in years. And knowing what they did with Witcher 3, it will be ironed out. I still have faith in CDPred."
1609886532,"i know i might be a fanboy here, but despite some glitches here and there i had no problems (might be lucky and hardware related) i reeeally enjoyed the atmosphere, the story was nothing insane but quite an enjoyable ride. there is plenty of sidecontent and it is mixed up enough that you wont get bored instantly, i mean yes most are get to or into location x and do y or retrieve item xy stuff like that, but packaged entertainingly, sprinkle in the occasional nod and easteregg and a really nice soundtrack and in my opinion you got a really good game on your hands (experiences may of course differ, if you are plagued by glitches and bugs, but like said i didnt have too many of those)"
1609886532,The bugs are not a big deal. the game runs fine and its amazing so far.
1609886383,"CD PROJEKT RED  ... One moment please while I run spell CHECK ....CD PROJECT REKD
What a beautiful disguise of a #1 Game of the year prospect in this little jewel. The optimization of this failure is so bad that I had to run 1080 and low to mid graphic settings just to get a decent frame rate. 57 fps. I run games in 4k VR that perform better than this crap. I am completely and utterly disappointed after waiting for over a year listening to all the hype and crap that went with it, I angrily refunded my purchase on steam. I was looking so forward to this game and it fell flat on it's face right out of the gate. Of the 84 minuted I have logged into this game, an hour of it was trying to get it to run. I barely entered the game, went and did some training and set out on my first mission. I never made it there. It may be a great game, but I'll never know, at least not anytime soon.

HOW can you tell people that this is what the game will have and then it doesn't have it?! I pre-ordered this shit and I was avoiding Youtube reviews because I don't like spoilers and I played 40 hours to figure out most of the features are missing or broken and now Steam (who are a bunch of ****-***** and I will boycott them, I won't buy another game on Steam because they do not care about consumers they only care about stealing your money. Games are supposed to go through a certification process and this game should have been released in Early Access and not as a AAA title!) refuse to refund so many people who are unhappy with this game. How can you tell in 2 hours if a game is broken or not or if the features are there that you payed for?
It's impossible with a game this size on top of that CD Project RED promised patches on Day 1 and more patches have come so people atleast want to see if the patches fix or add the missing/broken features before immediately requesting a refund.

I am so disappointed and I wont be pre-ordering a game from Steam or CD Project Red again."
1609886362,"I know my personal experience with the game isn't indicative of everyone's, but at the time of this review I've played over 180 hours and have had only minor bug issues (less than skryim). I think the game has caught a lot of flak, but honestly its one of the best games I've played in recent history. It reminds me a lot of playing through Fallout 3 for the first time. If it looks like your thing and you've got the change to spare I say pick it up!"
1609886329,"It's honestly just not that deep, or even fun. Yes, it is buggy as hell. But the game is just so....dull? I drive around (poorly, because the driving sucks) doing repetitive quests, because otherwise there is nothing to do in the city.

It's a boring game, and I am extremely disappointed. I was looking forward to this for so long, and then this is what we got."
1609887240,"I really thought this game was going to be a lot better with the level of activities, but overall the game is well designed (besides the glitches) and I have had a lot of fun playing it. I always tell myself that if I can play a game an hour for every dollar I spend on it, then its well worth it.
I give the game a 9/10. You can't fly ):"
1609886249,"Very enjoyable, although overly sexual undertones. Perhaps that element could be more optional rather than somewhat forcing you to be exposed to some gross stuff, even approaching my worst all-time movie. The Hostel series. *shudder*"
1609886128,"Game is great and looks nice mostly, but it would need half a year of patching before its really great.
To compare gameplay with GTA 5 , GTA 5 was a much more mature game at release but Cyberpunk gains in making the world feel more interesting.

+Fun
+The world feels alive
+Very good music
+Some really nice graphics aspects
+Interesting characters

-Buggy/glitchy
-Some physics, gameplay and graphics feels like a 10 year old game
-Performance, very demanding. Thought the RTX 3000 series would be overkill for a couple of years, I was wrong.
-Looting, you have to search and review the stuff all the time
-Perk system is weak and confusing

Tip: Dont get the auto junk disassemble perk, it will disassemble valuble stuff as labeled ""junk"" making you gain money much slower in the beginning... I have to live with my choice."
1609885928,"Oh V, don't tell me doubt's creepin in!

So listen up, before you go to night city, update your drivers, change your graphic options to something not so demanding, you don't need that ultra  corpo 4k or whatever bullshit, just go classic, like we did back in the old days.

Enjoy the game and make the right decision."
1609885860,WORK IN PROGRESS - DOES NOT REPRESENT FINAL LOOK OF THE GAME
1609885665,Great game
1609885608,"Dejando a un lado que eventualmente los bugs seran corregidos el juego en si no es muy increible o inmersivo como un buen rpg. La AI de la ciudad es muy basica y una copia de la presente el w3 (incluso las mismas animaciones) y el sistema de niveles y perks es muy anticuado. Ningun perk agrega habilidad alguna, solo son mejoras porcentuales que poco motivan a conseguirlas. Por eso mismo hoy en dia no recomiendo el juego. Quizas cuando cueste la mitad y los bugs esten planchados valga la pena."
1609885579,"I’m gonna be honest here. I actually really enjoy the game. It’s definitely tons of fun. I put about 70+ hours into it. But the reason why I don’t recommend it is because of all the bugs it has. I can’t go though one day without running into problems. Like sometimes I can even pick some items up even if I have my reticle directly pointing at the item. I also can’t even preform breach protocols sometimes. Those are the two major bugs I’ve ran into and I hope they fix it as soon as possible. I would totally recommend this game if it wasn’t so broken. Sure they’ll fix it overtime, but releasing the game in its current state at full price and fixing it later is unacceptable."
1609885419,After all of the patches come out the game will probably be beyond great. Right now the bugs are off the chains and it definitely ruins the experience
1609885356,"Don't believe the clickbait hate bandwagon. You're not buying it on PS4 if you're reading this. This game is a fantastic 9.5/10 on PC. It is on par with the quality of Witcher 3 with the key differences being better gameplay but shorter main story.

There are bugs, but they're minor and almost always easily fixed. The gameplay is fast, fun and unique. You can approach each encounter in many completely unique ways depending on build and player choice. The characters are very well done, believable and memorable, Voice acting is great, especially Keanu Reeves. Quest design and player decisions are in the same vein as Witcher 3 where a tough decision won't immediately have consequences but will impact you further on adding a lot of replay value.

Night City is beautiful, vibrant and terrifying. The game is visually stunning and the world feels alive and full of NPCs going about their business.

The only main complaints I have are difficulty in aquiring legendary armor past level 50 and players becoming hilariously overpowered in the endgame. Mods are already addressing the former and my hope is future DLC will provide more challenge."
1609885314,More of a f*ing experience than a game..shitty
1609885222,so far minor bugs here and there. the story is amazing!
1609885134,classic.
1609885106,Totally Digging it!
1609884957,It's kinda poopoo.
1609884755,"10 / 10. One of the best games I ever played.


A bit of back story:
I first heard of the game from this trailer back in 2013:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2tJ6P5POks
And then I sort of forgot about until recently I saw it released on Steam.


Detailed review:

I like the main story line (even though I did not finish it yet, even after 80+ hours of game time)
It is very detailed, very immersive in my opinion, like you actually care about the characters and their relationship between you and them. Also lot's of moments that challenge your morality and ethics, which allows you to truly connect with your character as you tend to make choices that are closer to your true inner self.


Huge variety of side quests which is AWESOME. And by huge variety I mean like 80+ hours and I am not even close to being bored, or finishing the main story line.  
I would give them three tiers:
- one of a kind quest
- standard quest
- xp farm quest

one of a kind quest:
This type of quest is like a separate side story that you can get involved in. Sometimes it is long, sometimes short.
Despite its length, each is immersive, detailed, and fits very well into the setting the game creates.

standard quest:
This quest falls under one type out of a variety of types of quests (example: steal, sabotage, assassinate, and some others). Now the general goal of the quest will repeat (for example there is an x amount of ""steal an item"" quests, and y amount of ""assassinate target"" quests), but each of quests no matter what type it falls under, feels like a little story of it's own. Each quest has its own back story, its own motive and setting. 

xp farm quest:
These type of quests have a few types, each type is mostly the same no mater which one you take on (except for the setting, as the location and loot will be different for each). 
Reason I call them xp farm quests, is because they provide a different method to level up your character, which focuses more on doing same type of action for xp / loot. (Don't get me wrong, you can easily level up your character by doing main story line, one of a kind and standard quests.) I would recommend doing these quests if you want to level up quickly, and then pass all other quests like an over powered boss that the game in a sense wants you to become (could be wrong here, but this is my impression so far).


Bugs:
I am a PC player, and so far I cannot say I encountered any game breaking bugs (especially now that the save file issue has been patched).

Bugs which I did encounter either gave me good laugh, or were exploits that helped me avoid grinding for cash.
For example there was a car that I really fancied and wanted it right that moment, so I exploited some quick cash and continued to enjoy the game even more :) 
(NOTE: the game does not force you to use exploits, and does not even hint that those exist, so people who do not want to exploit don't need to worry about this, and people who do want to exploit, google is your friend)


Things I would like to see fixed:
In some cars, please raise the first-person-view camera because I cannot drive some of my favorite cars because I cannot see in front of me. But the third person view still allows me to enjoy them, so this is not something critical in my opinion.


Note to people with an Intel NUC Hades Canyon:
You need to first update Intel drivers, then update AMD drivers for the game to run smoothly.
Don't know about you, but I had serious issues with this :D


Why the bad reviews from other people?
I think over the years this game received a lot of hype, and displayed a lot of promising features, so people's expectations were really high, but the game released in a not so finished state with some features missing, thus ruining a lot of expectations. Understandably here, I think any game will receive poor reviews.

But if you are like me, who did not expect much from the game in the first place, and you like this type of genre, I think you will greatly enjoy it, like I did.


"
1609884547,"This game is great. Its true that it needs work and glitches/crashes sometimes but it takes 1 minute to reload. Compared to the 90+ hours of fun i've had with it, a one minute reload is really not that bad."
1609884483,"Let me just say I in no way went into this with all the hype that others did I simply wanted a new gta with a more skyrim based rpg aspect compared to gta. It delivers.
Currently I am on my third play through to experience all the lifepaths and get all the iconic weapons and have completed every quest.
This game does have its bugs yes and I feel bad for those on last gen consoles but as someone with a 1000 dollar computer thats easily 3-4 years old I have ran it on damn near high settings with a few tweaks, no outside mods to correct any in game aspect and have yet to encounter a truly game breaking bug.
Ive had to save and reload or completely restart the game to get a desired result and while yes not what you want to have happen but no where near game breaking. So below I will do my quick pros and cons.

Pros;
-Its a great story with great voice acting
-Free DLC's in the future
-To fully complete takes a good investment of time and although some of the ncpd scanner hustles got repetitive it was no were near as bad as the invade this fort unlock this territory template that most new games have stuck with i.e Days Gone, Ghost recons, Far cry, and so many others and they attempt to spruce it up by providing little readable lore items that explain why the massacre you just stumbled upon happened.
-The game has a dedicated developer and support team behind it so I expect things to get better with bugs once theyve had some time to iron out a few things

Cons
-There are bugs some that may ruin a cut scene with some silly clipping or mess up your aim on a crucial fight leading to a quick flatline and last checkpoint and for some who value the immersion or play with outside rules like no deaths yada yada this might be deal breaking.
-AI difficulty once you have the game kinda figured out and utilize crafting/iconic weapons with good effects you can walk through very difficult no problem. On my current play through I currently do not have a single combat or health based perk unlocked and have yet to encounter anything that has resulted in more than two or three deaths and with my previous character at max level hitting 1mil+ dmg headshots with a smart sniper or 250k with a revolver headshot while sitting with 3000+armor the game is broken easy and this is all with in game earned or crafted items no glitches no mods no nothing to alter the items.
-No new game+ mode and doesnt continue from the story ending instead takes you back to a point before the ""final mission"" it may just be me but I hate this as a ending. Either let me start over and get some items or things I may of missed while fighting much more difficult mobs or let me live the ending. I hate being made a king just to have to keep playing as a peasent ya know lol
-Does require some tweaking of in game settings in order to run smoothly. I suggest a quick google search of your GPU and processor and following a quick setup guide to really let the game shine."
1609884401,"This is a pretty wrapper with a dog turd inside. Everything is shallow and fake. Everything about the open world feels two generations out of date. Most of the things promised were cut out so they could get something finished. None of the decisions matter. Your dialogue is meaningless. The driving feels bad. Combat feels bad. The glitches are bad. Apart from just feeling the cyberpunk vibe in the first couple hours and taking a quick look around, there isn't much to keep you playing here. It really is just a bad game, regardless of the bugs. Watch the review by BeatEmUps on youtube. I think he did the best job summarizing everything."
1609884394,"It has bugs? yeah, a lot of them. 
But the storyline, the sides quests and Night City... maaan night city is amazing! 
"
1609884220,"This game in a nutshell: 'Style over substance""


Maybe they will update it and it will get better? I doubt it but hope so."
1609884169,"I don't know what people are saying about this game glitching, I bought it when it first came out and haven't had a single issue as of yet. However with that said, I would say there are some things they could have done differently. Overall 9/10."
1609884065,I could not recommend this game to anyone. The bugs and glitches play a big part in that reason but to be honest after 50 hours it just got boring. It has so many problems unrelated to bugs/glitches and there's no replay value on top of it. I think maybe in a year it will be much better but we basically paid to beta test the game. This is definitely the last time I will be burned. No more preordering for me .. these companies need to start having the mentality of releasing more polished and more flushed out games instead of the fix it later mentality. In it's current state its no more than a 6/10 and with the bugs and glitches 4/10.
1609883980,Don't believe the hate you read online. This is my GOTY
1609883914,There were a few bad glitches but overall the game was enjoyable and I managed to see a few endings without much difficulty. Once the patches start to hit it would be worth another playthrough. Runs pretty well out my slightly outdated computer.
1609883868,Great game but could use another year in development.
1609883758,"very buggy,  but everyone knows that.  when not bugged... GREAT."
1609883724,00000
1609883585,a few bugs but still better than skyrim
1609883448,"Its a good but not great game. Its a limited RPG through narrative very much like The Witcher and not the ""be anyone or anything you desire"" game that it claimed in ads. Its fun though, with a great setting and the characters like Johnny, Panam, Judy who make a big difference. Cybernetics and and general combat gameplay though is not as expansive or creative as it could have been. The bugs and lack of polish of course really hurt the game too, but overall its a good but not great game."
1609883371,"Si querias comprar el juego esperando una obra maestra como The Witcher 3, te equivocaste de juego.
El juego es muy bueno, pero lejisimos de ser una obra maestra. Esta plagado de bugs, te conviene guardar constantemente por que en cualquier momento puede surgir un bug que no te deje completar una mision y la unica forma de terminarla es cargando un juego guardado.
Por ejemplo, una mision donde tenes que volar unos tanques disparandoles y por un bug del juego, estos son indestructibles. Unica solucion, empezar la mision desde el principio (ni siquiera sirvio cargar un punto un poco anterior, por que ya estaba bugeado). 
Entre las misiones secundarias hay unas pocas magnificas y la mayoria son todas iguales. Anda a tal lugar y mata a X o roba X, etc. Solo unas pocas destacan realmente. 
Una verdadera lastima como desaprovecharon el potencial de las neurodanzas para hacer misiones secundarias realmente buenas para usarlo en forma super simple. Y para colmo la presentacion de las neurodanzas en el juego principal te las pintan como que tenes un monton de cosas para hacer. 

Resumen: Es un muy buen juego que le falta pulir infinidad de cosas, les falto al menos 2 años completos de trabajo. Una verdadera lastima."
1609883109,game suxxz lol
1609883073,"This game is shallow and gay even if it wasn't a broken piece of dookie shit there's still virtually nothing to do in shart city (trust me),  had the development team not been entirely made up of females the game would've been good.
"
1609883053,love it. plain and simple
1609883045,"I have been playing the table top Cyberpunk game since the early 90s, and I have to say that this is probably the best realization of that game in the digital media. 

I love the weapons, the mods, the cyberware, the quick hacks, not to mention a solid set of quest story lines. This game has it all. A few glitches here and there? Sure. But any game this large has to have them. Took me nearly 150+ hours to clear the entire game, and I still want more.

This instantly has gone into my top 10 games of all time."
1609883043,The story is great the bugs make it more fun to me.
1609882927,"tis good
"
1609957423,"TL;DR BUYERS BEWARE!!!!

It's a mystery to me how anyone in their right mind or who played actually good rpgs, looter shooters or open world games in the last 20 years can recommend this game.
At launch Cyberpunk 2077 is a bug riddled mess with broken half baked systems and with obviously missing content.
If you have a mid to high-end rig it looks good at least.
I really wanted to like this game despite of the well documented flaws posted all over the internet.
If you for some reason read my review I urge you NOT to buy this game at this point in time, NOT for 60 bucks not for 30.
Wait until CDPR or the modding community fixes this dumpster fire if it's even possible.

But honestly if you want to play a good game and not a 'great potential', avoid this like the plague."
1609882909,"Great game, some hitches sure, but its to be expected in a game with all these moving parts."
1609882881,"Game breaking bugs aside, it's just not a great game. Crafting is confusing, then easily exploitable once you figure it out. it's possible to make your character a virtual god even on the hardest difficulty. Story wasn't compelling. It's no Witcher 3."
1609882782,"Despite the obvious technical flaws and problems and cleary cut content...I had fun.
That's it. It's that simple.
I had more fun than with most of the other games i've played in the past year and a half. And that's what games are about. To entertain."
1609882554,"no its just not good its a buggy mess and the beginning game is just made to push you past the refund cap i did refund it tho. so yeah nothing to say besides it wont run smooth on my machine and is a buggy mess, again."
1609882432,"Please take this recommendation with a grain of salt. CP2077 is one of the most beautiful, detailed, immersive worlds I've ever been a part of. The story is incredible, the characters are memorable, and the gameplay/missions are all fun.

BUT, as you may have heard, this game is VERY buggy at the moment. I play with an i9 9900k and a 2080ti (plus 64gbs of DDR4 RAM). My system is optimized, the settings are too, yet the game can't avoid pop-up and graphical glitches. The AI gets really dumb, some of the missions were straight up broken (the first Johnny Silverhands mission didn't progress originally), and the movements of the characters in your environment get whacked out regularly.

This is to be expected in a game this big, and it's great they're patching it up. But I think it's most honest to say: CP2077 WILL BE the best game of the year. The reason the bugs are so distracting is because, outside of the glitches, it's the best game I've played in years. I just want to feel the immersion and not deal with crashes, graphical glitches, and bugs. When I can fully immerse myself in Night City, I'll be thrilled.

So basically, it's a great game, but it will be the perfect game in a few months. If you want the best possible experience, you may want to wait until then."
1609882370,Yes
1609882171,Amazing game. Enough said.
1609882152,Just enjoy it you gonks
1609882023,"if i were to describe the game in a single sentence it would definitely be ""Wide as an ocean, but 3ft deep""

took me about 50-60 hours to complete all the unique content (main+side jobs) in the game, the rest after that is just hunting around for the NCPD stuff and grinding money for cars.

one play-through is all thats worth it right now since the life paths change nothing major about the story and just provide alternate routes to the same outcome in every job. and the clusterfuck that is the attribute trees completely ruins replayability for the game with how all over the place and restrictive it is.

Examples
-Attribute tree stats not affecting their sub trees besides being unlock requirements 
-Crafting (aside from quickhacks) is entirely locked behind the Tech tree and not distributed through the other trees like similar RPG games.
- For some reason the Cool attribute tree seems to be an entire stealth/assassin build all on its own making it pretty much useless for any build other than that.
-Cyberware being locked behind Attribute requirements based on its bodily location, not its effects in some cases

its still a good game imo but only for 1 playthrough right now and theres ALOT that needs to be fixed before i'll think about doing another one"
1609881995,GTA 6?
1609881885,"Played on PC so bugs were mostly graphical, funny and only occasionally game breaking, 1 or 2 bugged quests that required a reload or two.

Story:
I felt the MSQ was short, disjointed and lacking substance. It feels like major plot points connected by loose threads that they did not have the time to complete. 
Gangs are pointless since there are no factions. Fixers are just quest givers and all quests are basically the same. (kill this person, save this person, upload a virus)
A few major side quest chains feel mostly complete, but ultimately suffer from feeling like they were written by a high school edgelord. It does not get too graphic, but it feels try hard, gross, lazy and ultimately just dull. Like watching a bad episode of SVU. 
At least 2 other quests chains are really interesting, but cut short and left at a dead end. A standout hints at a vast mind control conspiracy, but it just ends with no resolution.
There is lots of lore books, if you're into that, but none of it really connects to the story or succeeds in making the world feel more alive.

All of the small mini-encounters are you helping the cops, which I hated. It's a series of, ""here is an assult in progress,"" or ""Here is this crime, please kill bad guy for us."" Does not feel very cyberpunk to help the cops. 
Oh, the cops will attack you on the street if they see you and spawn behind you, even if you're on top of a building. Can't tell if intentional or broken.
Gameplay:
The combat feels fun and there are a few different play-styles to choose from. I opted for quickhacks and it really feels overpowered when maxed out. The gun play is fun, but enemies can feel like bullet sponges. Stealth feels broken. Seems impossible to not get detected by enemies. I'm assuming this is another thing that was not finished/fully tested. 
Driving controls suck. It's floaty and hard to control cars. Motorcycles are better, but for some reason take turns wider than a semi truck. 
The environments seem lush and rich at first glace, until you explore and realize how empty the world is. Also, everything is the same broken down, dirty rooms everywhere. It's 2077, you'd think things would not be so damn boring all over.
Crafting feels pointless, since it seems crafting recipes for armor are bugged and don't show up, or they are simply not in the game.
They put out lots of promo work about style, which fits with the tabletop themes, but they fail to deliver and you just end up looking like a clown with the Spock helmet, neon miniskirt and garish jacket because it has the best armor and you cant craft anything that looks good. 


Final thoughts:
The game feels unfinished, unpolished, shallow and not at all what the devs presented. Kind of like FF15 at launch. 

All that being said, I had fun doing the boring repetitive quests and exploring but have no desire to replay until there the game feels more complete, also like FF15.
"
1609881784,"At the time of writing, I have 80 hours put in and I am torn between trying to decide if it has been great or just average. I think it is fair to say this was released way to soon, even on pc, no doubt under pressure from management to hit the market for the Christmas period. Also, it has been a major victim of the hype that was built up by CDPR marketing.
If you had the pleasure of living under a rock for 2020 and missed all the hype and promises that were made and meet it at face value, it is a fun experience. Some of the missions and characters are fantastic, the city is also a wonder. But once you put the time in, you start to notice the cracks in the actual game world, then more and more until the whole experience starts to become less enjoyable. Walk through a busy area, only to look back and see a ghost town, gangs of the same npc's standing at street corners, summoning my vehicle and seeing it rising out of solid ground, talking npc's who's head I blew off, committing a crime, even accidently, only for the police to spawn right beside you and blow you away. At times this is an RPG that is no more innovative than an RPG that came out 10 years ago.
Long story short, this game may not be up to the desired state the developers working on it wanted it to be until mid or late summer of 2021. Knowing this has made me wonder if I am playing the early access version and if I am better off waiting for a few patches to hit. If they are going to pull a No Man’s Sky on this, then would I prefer to wait until it has got itself in order? But will my save even function after a few patches? There is a good game in here as it stands, but hopefully it will be even better in the coming months

1609881743,"I really love this I wish they delayed the game to fix the glitches because The Glitch effected the game reputation this game deserves much more

"
1609881678,"despite all of the flaws in the game, i still find it enjoyable as long as you know what you're going into. first off, it does have its fair share of glitches, though i have yet to find any that make the game unplayable. most just give me a good laugh and then i move on. second off, at times it can drop frames like hell. i've always found that a save and then entirely closing the game fixes this(note: normally it does run fine for me, i have a gtx 2060 and 16gb ram, intel i7, so the issue doesnt come from hardware for me, its from the amount of time the game has been up for.) third, it is very story-reliant, so if you prefer games with less story this is not one made for you.

all in all, i still find the game fun to play, and i think others can too as long as they know what theyre getting into."
1609881633,"Fun game, great story. Handles well on my low tier pc."
1609881560,From my experience the bugs have not been bad. There has been some glitches and bugs but nothing to dislike the the game for. Most of my gaming has been done with bethesda games and modding them. And cyberpunk runs better than my modded fallout 4 so i guess thats a plus. Storyline is good. I still havent beat it yet so idk how the well the replay value is .
1609881437,"This game has the most bugs I have ever seen. The bugs are funny for the most part rather than game breaking but I did encounter some frustrating bugs. The AI isn't anything special and the missions could have used more variety.

That being said the actors and the story kept me going. I greatly enjoyed the story and I was curious to see where it would go. I'd recommend waiting a few months to pick the game up so that you can enjoy it without the bugs."

By the time the credits rolled and I felt that I got what I came for I teared up and reflected on things in my real life.  I thought about my biggest regrets and what I could have done better.  Why is a video game making me self-reflect?  Maybe regardless of the medium ""art"" is meant to stir those emotions and get you thinking and this game did that for me.  Thank you CD Projekt Red I cant want for the finished product."

1609881047,Naniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
1609881040,I love it
1609880980,"Ignoring the hype and the controversy, this game is really stinkin' good. It has lots of flaws, and you basically require a decent PC to fully enjoy it, or one of the new consoles. The game is missing lots of content, and you can tell certain questlines were cut due to time restrictions. And lots of people have had lots of crashes. But when the game works, and when you're actually playing, rather than reloading saves due to bugs, it's a blast. The writing and characters are super well done, gunplay is solid and satisfying, and creating your ideal build is tons of fun. 
If you can run the game, I highly recommend. Thankfully, CDPR seems very set on improving the game, and with free DLC coming soon, I can only feel excited.
And it's gorgeous, even on medium settings."
1609880911,"Although the game has bugs and weird situations sometimes, it's not unplayable. Story and the possibilities are very enjoyable."
1609880857,"While there are some bugs, so far none have been game breaking and the gameplay and story is extremely enjoyable. Highly recommend."
1609880763,The game is Fucking Amazing. Unlocked 2 of the endings and i'm definitely going for the rest of them. 10/10 Would Recommend.
1609880682,Great game !
1609880436,"Need a 1660 series nvidia gpu or higher to have this run well, seemingly from what I hear even a 1080 runs terribly despite being better on paper. Looks beautiful though"
1609880159,"If you haven't been living under a rock, you know about this game and probably something about its unfortunately (but predictably) controversial launch. That said, is it good, and should you play it?

TL:DR: If you like the idea of a mashup of The Witcher 3 and Deus Ex (HR) with a few elements from GTA, and you have a reasonable PC, and can live with some bugs, then yes, it is a great experience and should not be missed. If any of the above bother you, or you expected this to be the Jesus of videogames that would allow infinite choice, side activities, etc, then stay away.

With that said, here's a fuller review:

First off, will say that while I do have a 1080, pretty much everything else in my rig is about 8 years old and I still run Windows 7. I can run this game with all graphics at their highest settings and it performs alright (looks beautiful, but low framerate). Turning off just a few key settings (film grain, etc) improves performance drastically and the game still looks great.

Graphics/visual design: Simply incredibly detailed and well done. The city is obviously the star, but the vehicle and weapon design is fantastic as well, as is the character design.

Soundtrack: If you've played a CDPR game before, you know how great their soundtracks are, and this game is no exception. Both the OST and the tracks created for the radio stations are fantastic.

Story/writing: Up to the standards CDPR set with Witcher 3, though it takes a bit more digging in terms of side quests to get the full effect. There are many side quests in this game that probably would have been main quests in W3, and greatly expand the latter stages of the story and the end of the game. The characters and conversations are very well written and dialogue feels very natural (excepting the particular slang used in Night City).

Gameplay: Do you want to play this as basically an FPS? You can. Do you want to play this as a hacking ninja who wipes out enemies without ever stepping foot inside a building? You can. Do you want to play this basically like Deus Ex Human Revolution? You can, though it is more difficult. You can also play any mix of these, or as a melee combat specialist. Basically your playstyle is pretty much whatever you want to shape it to be, and gets better as you go. The downside of this is that it does become a ""jack of all trades, master of none"" situation where each individual style has been done better in another game or series. But the options it offers up give a lot of freedom. Driving feels too floaty (on keyboard/mouse anyway) and could use some tightening up, but it isn't the focus of this game and can be minimized by using fast travel if you want.

The game isn't perfect - here are a few gripes:

Bugs/stability: I didn't experience a whole lot of bugs during the gameplay itself (nothing worse than any other open world RPG at launch, really), but the stability of the game is an issue for my rig and does crash frequently, generally taking my whole OS down with it and forcing a reboot. I can't look in the mirror or take shots in photo mode without this happening. Hopefully future patches will fix this, as neither were an issue for me before the last two hotfixes.

Customization: While not essential to the core of the game, it would be nice to be able to alter your appearance during gameplay. There are many clothes worn by NPCs that are frankly more interesting than a lot of the gear you can get and some expansion there would be nice. Being able to select different color schemes for your car would be great (could frankly be limited to what is already in the game). These are all ""nice to haves"", but the game isn't any worse for not having them.

AI: This is where the game needs most of its fixing - the police and NPC AI feels pretty janky. Frankly this is pretty minor unless you want to try to play the game like it's GTA (which it isn't), but is still pretty noticeable.

Final verdict: Easily in my top five games, and would highly recommend, especially if you like cyberpunk as a genre. I do think it will be improved with patches and DLC and become better than it is, but I've really enjoyed my time with the game so far and despite being a bit rough around the edges I think it's a fantastic experience."
1609879942,gREAT rpg IN SPITE OF THE GLITCHES WHICH ARE MORE FUNNY THAN DEAL BREAKING IN MY OPINION.
1609979407,"I definitely enjoyed the game despite the massive amount of problems it has, like every system in this game seems to be broken, but it looks great on the surface.
my sympathies to the dev team.
Where it does shine is the main story (even though its VERY short), and the side missions where you interact with with the side characters, specifically Panam was by far the best story line in my opinion. Would have liked to see more of this with other characters we came across. 

im excited to play this game again in a year when its done."
1609879772,I enjoy it.
1609879732,Chilling
1609879724,"Dunno what people are complaining about, it's a very good game."
1609879575,"Good game with a little jank but overall fun,"
1609879361,Fuckin' love it. Here's to this!
1609879279,This game is buggy and incomplete. Don't buy :)
1609879112,Great game
1609879103,It's alright - its gonna be even better once it has been released from Early Access :)
1609879629,"This is not like the Witcher 3 Wild Hunt. It is from the same makers though. So I thought give it a try and till now I like it. Some minor bugs like some characters T-posing but nothing game breaking. Its a story driven first person shooter. Many side quests. At the start you'll be like what is happening but getting use to it doesn't take too long. Give it a try if you see interesting gameplay on youtube.

One thing I didn't like was the weak costimization of the character you play. This isn't The Elder Scrolls or Fallout series strong but CD Project Red should ask them for help or someone in that darn company should've played a Bethesda game.

Also the RPG elements are pretty crappy. Open world is kinda ruined because there are guys that kill you in one shot. Kills exploration."
1609879015,Its good but not life changing so just wait until they patch things. Like a lot of things
1609878967,"I've played this game on my laptop at 720p and scaled down to 50% resolution, encountered tons of bugs, and struggled to get around 25 frames consistently. 

This is still one of the greatest games I've ever played, if not the best. Story and characters are absolutely genius. If this were a text adventure, I'd still gladly get it. The fact that some systems can run this way better just makes me look forward to playing it again when I have something like it. 

Several moments shook me, I cried, and I laughed. Damn fun narrative, loved the endings. 

Also the music is insane, blast ""All My Money on the Double"" and you will want to beat cyborg gods to death with a shovel."
1609879130,"If you play on PC (and have a nvidia gpu), this is a really fun game! Definitely has bugs which are mostly funny or easily overlooked, definitely has features missing that would elevate this game to god-tier, there were shaddy things going down at CD project red, but it is still very enjoyable with a great story and side gigs that range from masterpieces to almost boring. One of the few singleplayer games I see myself coming back to in later years just to re-experience the story, better graphics, and whatever else they add."
1609878595,"Do I really need to explain why this game is so awesome? I wish I had VR, this in VR would be epic....Like A super long half-life Alyx."
1609878553,"This game is like having sex to a crazy hot woman as a young man
-Looks mattered but you were blind to the reality of the situation
-You have a great story to tell your friends albeit you don't want to relive it
-You might want to reunite with her but you know she's dead inside
-It was great while it lasted

On a serious note, this game really is beautifully crafted but is stuck with the open world game curse. 
Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it but there's no replayability. I might come back once there's DLC's and some of the mechanics have been ironed out. 

Other than that, it was fun while it lasted Night City, but like the Nomad route I chose, I'm done with the craziness and off towards a new game."
1609878359,After a few patches i think that this game could be amazing but i would wait for this game to go on sale to buy it.
1609878255,"Good story, awesome characters, several ways to play - just bad launch day. Still patch 1,03 was better than 1.06 for me as it broke several particles on cars, robots and 2 enemy types and now i need to avoid them to keep my eyes OK. :D
70 in-game hours and still cannot change the radio station - confirmation click not working within any vehicle. :D"
1609878255,Good game
1609878205,"Buggy mess, doesn't run very well - far cry from what was promised. I will try it again in six months to a year."
1609878104,i know with the struggle of the glitches and everything in this game is annoying to say the least but this is a fantastic game at its core and im gonna stick around to see the finished product
1609878052,"Cyberpunk is a very fun finish to end game with great story and even better side quest. The world is immersive and rich and its very easy to get lost in it, while the bugs on the other hand definitely wake you fu*k up samurai.  I've spent tons of hours  in the cyberpunk and honestly after my 70th, I recommend others to do the same. 
"
1609878028,Eh its a bit buggy but if you like what is in the game and not what was advertised you will have a good time.
1609877796,"This game is fun to mess around, but runs poorly and is full of small bugs. Seeing all the visual glitches ruins the immersion of the (very basic) storyline. The main story lacks in comparison to games from the Gears of War or Call of Duty series. Cyberpunk does not feel like an RPG, or even as open world as Fallout 4. Item/weapons are barely customizable, and you get the feeling that whatever you equip makes little difference. This game feels like it's worth $30, so wait to buy.. or just skip this one."
1609877792,I mean.... I played it. I beat it. It was difficult at times because of the bugs and glitches. Story was interesting. There is a lot of lore. Some side missions were actually entertaining and different. I would buy it if it was on sale or they fix a lot of the game but it was enjoyable.
1609877713,this game fun
1609877662,its good.
1609877644,"Right off the bat, I have what is now a mid tier rig, and the two best things to do is: update your graphics, lower crowd density (mid was enough for me.)  I have done two playthroughs, and have had a blast. Yes its buggy, and yes, driving is horrible, but this game has so many great ideas, compelling sidequests, music and art that you get immersed in it between bugs making you cackle like there is no tomorrow. I hadn't been so absorbed in just walking around a world and enjoying the sights, well, ever!

If you survived Bethesda games, you will be fine, though I would say that manual save will be your best friend if you are scared of something going wrong."
1609877751,"Great game but nothing to write home about. Silly AI, there's no police in the city and do not tell me that is on purpose. I miss GTA V. City looks great but sometimes feels so empty as you cannot really go to that many places and people there are like... from Body Snatchers movies.. Main story seems very nice and some (so far what I've seen) side quests also. Kinda must buy and I do not regret buying this(!), but don't expect never ever seen this before stuff, oh dear how this is done etc. blah blah. This is just a good try but so many things left(?) like, not finished. Well, that's my opinion. Bugs are funny, maybe they shouldn't try to fix those, good part of the game, very funny ;) Cheers..."
1609877503,"It's a mess, even for PC, but i can't stop playing and i don't know why."
1609877436,"Yes, there are some bugs. But the gameplay, the graphics and everything is awesome, and I believe that CD Projekt Red will fix these bugs in future hotfixes. You have to try it on your own to see."
1609877898,"""As I've been telling you man, Night City is not just a creation, but a beautiful portrayal of the Cyberpunk genre, almost like a battlefield, a wasteland of lights, chips and wires. Where technology has risen enough not to extinguish crime, but to improve upon the already faulty interactions, giving police ultrasonic vehicles and criminals biological interfaces for hacking. Preserving the war but enhancing weaponry. A lovely transition of eons, with men giving up bronze just to pick up iron. An artfully developed world, but sick in many of the same ways. That's why they call it a dystopia, man. Because it looks like wherever men goes, wherever men looks, he inevitably finds himself bound by the same Rousseauian chains of yore [...]""

1609877194,amazing
1609877126,"I lowkey feel like this is an ugly game masked by good lighting. other than that? its good if you can run it. 
P.S
the beat the brat missions make me want to kms"
1609877115,"With GPU usage being stuck at 55% at lower settings, this is unplayable for me."
1609876928,"Awesome, but saddening"
1609876904,Just finished the game and now i feel miserable. 10/10 Would cry again.
1609876697,"At the end, its you who make a real game good or bad, and a real gamer makes all real games good games."
1609876382,"Looking past the hardware and software issues this game carries I can confidently say there is greatness inside this world and story. It's enthralling and almost jaw dropping in its aesthetic, the musical score is incomparable and the team behind it really outdid themselves. Voice acting is outstanding and the dialogue options add a feeling of immersion that provoked me to drop a ""holy fuck!"" or a ""gooooodaaaamnnn"". Really succeeds in getting me hyped for the character you play as. You've already seen the issues with this game all over the internet so I'm not gonna get into that, don't buy it if you doubt your rig can handle it in the slightest. It's a shame CDPR fucked the optimization and didn't put as much polish into the quality of life.. there's a great game buried under the issues."
1609876380,"Good game, bad bugs!"
1609876158,"its pretty pog
"
1609876101,"I want to love this game. With over 100 hours, i really can't. Visually it's just amazing but down to the core gameplay it just didn't deliver. The glitches don't bother me but the game was obviously rushed (even though we've been waiting 8 years for it) I do plan on coming back in a years time to give it a second chance. But until then, I can not recommend"
1610026416,"Although I'm not refunding, I'll say that this game is severely unpolished. It's definitely not worth the full 60 USD at the moment. The framework is there, but besides the solid foundation, everything built upon the premise of this game is lacking in every way. I don't recall the Witcher 3 having this troubled a launch... Anyway, I've run into numerous bugs even with the 1.0.6 hot-fix. Enemies getting stuck in elevators, enemies spotting you and going into combat mode from a floor below, V's car not finding V when you press V, door and elevator animations glitching, certain mission related objects de-spawning, and various weird occurrences. The path-finding on the mini-map and of AI is janky and the actions of the AI definitely is one of the stronger detractors from the game. Sometimes quest triggers or specific events are off and occur at weird times and others seem as designed, but are just not apparent to the player (Kold Mirage for instance, or one mission and a gig involving the Tyger Claws and a ripperdoc who gets his implants from landfills or something along those lines occurring at the same time). Although the story is compelling, and the gameplay loop is fun, the game needs more patches, better implementation of gameplay elements, and heavy optimization. I have a 1660 Super and even though at 1080p on low I get 60 FPS in a majority of the game, certain areas are not optimized well and will cause my 1% lows to go into the mid 30's (Area near Tom's diner, Yagami Market, etc.). Could just be my mid-tier hardware, but to even play this game without feeling like you're stripping away great looking graphical effects, you already are forking out hundreds or even thousands for a god tier PC to run this at a stable frame-rate on top of the 60 bucks for the darn thing. This release was definitely a blessing and a curse wrapped into one. I want to give this a 9.5/10 for the amazing atmosphere, story, environment, and interactive elements, but also a 5/10 for the dogshit launch. Please fix this CD Projekt Red. I know it probably is a sweatshop over there now, and investors are sinking a lot of cash into this, but I think that as devs, CPR is just as excited and disappointed as the end consumer and will be more than eager to fix this out of love for the craft. At least I hope this is the sentiment. Also personally, I would've liked to see a better inventory management system (holding down the craft button to continuously craft, being able to select a group of items at once, being able to transfer stacks of items instantly, being able to transfer all inventory items), more side character romance options that don't affect the ending (Joss maybe, Claire, an option that is accessible by both female and male V), and a better and more fleshed out NCPD arrest system. Small complaints and nitpicks, and the glaring obvious bugs just make this a super disappointing launch. I hope that with more work over the game's lifespan that Cyberpunk 2077 will be the game that we all hoped for. 

After another 14 hours of gameplay and deciding to finish the final mission, I feel like the endings are decent, and offer enough closure, but are still based on open ended choices that seem to cause totally preventable tragedies. I guess I'm just retarded and haven't been paying too much attention to details of the story, or am trying too hard to self insert myself as V. It is an RPG game though. I'll probably run the game back again and see how I feel after that and then do all the different endings off the 2nd play's point of no return.

Now all that's left is to wait for this fucking game to ACTUALLY be finished so I can truly enjoy it. I hope to god that they polish this turd as well as Rockstar did GTA V..."
1609875933,I can't finish the story. thanks bug <3
1609875925,"Its good for an early access game i guess


P.S. The game has no DRM ;)"
1609875855,Gorilla arms 1000/10
1609875552,"Leaving the bugs aside, this is an enjoyable experience. This game has all the hallmarks of GOTY, but the missed opportunities and mistakes are glaring. The wanted system makes no sense. There are some major gaps in the narrative of how Night City works (what's with all the NCPD missions, the NCPD are suppose to be as corrupt as any gang). The story is very static and your decisions have very little impact. Your backstory plays no role in the game. Lack of a reputation system. This really should not have been marketed as an RPG, because it's just not. It's an action adventure with some role playing elements. There is a lot of obvious cut content to make a deadline. I feel awful for the developers, it is clear they were not given the right timing or resources to succeed despite their talent. The game has so much potential, if this was released as an early access then I would understand the short comings. But it was not and the pricing reflected that. For what was released, it is an enjoyable game and I will continue to play it. But it's not going to have the staying power that games like Wicher, Fallout or Elderscrolls have had for me. I hesitantly recommend this game, but lower your expectations."
1609875453,"The game was a bit slow to start, but once it got going, it was tons of fun! I know there's been reports of bugs and glitches, but I have experienced very few in my 50 hours of gameplay. Of the ones I did experience, none of them were game-breaking. It's an engaging, fun, and immersive experience."
1609875413,"Only have 152 hours and on second play through.  Nomad this time with more stealth which is why I love this game.  Doing every mission again but with different strats.  First was run/gun this time more sneaky.  Heck next time maybe ill tech through everything.  So much to do!!! don't believe the media bs, this game is amazing!!!"
1609875359,Amazing game
1609875267,UNLOCK MY REMAINING 3 ACHIEVEMENTS YOU MFS!!!!
1609875258,Awesome game! i'm fortunate that I have a good enough PC to run it on high and CD Project Red def delivered. Sure there are a few bugs here and there but nothing gamebreaking. Some elements can be fixed like removing craft time delays but otherwise an awesome game! Just glad they didn't push it back more. Also story can be more RPG driven but it's definitely more polished and story driven than  all bethesda games on release. Don't believe the haters (unless you're a console pleb) and if you have a feew or 2 free jump in. I'm just waiting for the devs or modders to make more immersive content but it's oly gonna get better with time
1609875231,nice
1609875204,"filled with bugs, broken AI, MESH HOLES in the map, crashes, missing features(that were advertised btw), runs like shit, constant fps spikes, un-playable while driving.  Take your $60 and buy 3 copys of GTA 4, throw away 2 of them, and you still have a better investment than flushing money down the toilet on this ""game.""  Currently playing the game just so I can trash it on Youtube.  DO NOT BUY."
1609874858,If you have the beef required to run this game I would for sure grab it. It is a heavy story driven game with other mechanics that are up to par to support the gameplay. The main questline is great with tons of sidequests that offer content that could either be funny encounters or more serious and meaningful stories. If you enjoyed the Witcher 3 you will most likely enjoy this game as well. I loved playing it and look forward to future dlc and bugfixes.
1609874781,"It's GTA on crack. Open playable world, no nonesense if you don't want it...Choose your destiny. Good shit."
1609874717,"Looks absolutely stunning and enjoyed the first play through with only the rare bug here and there that required a reload.  That said, while it is usually a good sign if you are left wanting more,  the story line felt like it came to an abrupt end only just after it seemed like it was starting to pick up."
1609874714,"Стоит играть только на хорошем железе. Багов поймал не так много, как все пишут. Сайд квесты пездатые(не все), основная история тоже ничего. Сгорел с мёртвого мира и взаимодействия с ним. И ещё: качайте интеллект."
1609874601,"Overall i would say its a very good game though its not the game that was advertised.
This is by far the most buggy/glitchy AAA game I have ever played. Around ever corner i ran into floating objects, cars falling from the sky, falling through the map also had a few side missions that were so broken i was unable to complete them. I understand CD Project Red had time and management issues throughout the development time, but that is no excuse to release a game with a huge amount of bugs and a ton of false advertising. 
What's here is a good first person Story game and a terrible RPG, i cant help but feel cheated from the gameplay reveals giving false expectations and i hope in time they fix and add at least some of the missing mechanics.
Final rating: 6/10"
1609874507,"Never have I ever played a game with as immersing world and characters I actually care about with a ton of content to play and mini stories to discover (at least 140h worth of content for my first playtrough). 

Game is beautiful on every front: graphics, story, characters, soundtrack, gameplay and runs well on my PC with little issues and lot of the criticism the game is getting is just plain false. Most definitely my GOTY2020"
1609874477,Aside from the occasional hilarious bug I absolutely love this game!!!!!
1609874473,"I love this game. That said, it isn't without its issues. Story, characters, combat, customization, world building - all of these things are fantastic. Where the game falls short are these:
1. Devs lied (about a lot)
2. Game clearly had a lot of stuff cut (hopefully that stuff will get added back in future updates)
3. Buggy

tl;dr This game is very fun and you will enjoy it if you like story-driven and fps games. When playing it, patience with bugs is necessary and certain things won't live up to the hype. Overall, it was a very solid game that I wish they had waited longer to release so they could do all that they planned with it. As is, it is a fantastic title. I just wish it could have seen its true potential. That said, in future updates they will add in a lot of cut stuff and free dlc. I have hope for the game as it is CDPR. I hope this review helps and if you get it that you enjoy it as much as I do!"
1609874427,eh
1609874390,epic funny bugs lmao
1609874058,"I get the frustration from console players but the PC version is stable to play.  The game is excellent visually, but they (CDPR) have done something (gameplay) that I have never seen in games.  The slow down combat is lore immersive, the netrunning is fun and useful, and the brain dancing is awesome for not only story but for fun ways to display cut scenes.  I love the story and yes you get to be Keanu Reeves while having sex with a hottie, lol!  Look, just try it out with the knowledge that more is coming.  It is worth the money with the amount of story play, I just finished the human farm mission and loved the story.  A romance NPC, due to my conversation choices, actually toasted our dead friend because I did for her because she remembered, programmed, to do so.  Amazing!"
1609873995,"I have thoroughly enjoyed playing this game.   Great story, great game play, I just wish the main story was longer, but it's still well worth the money."
1609873879,the game gets super boring and the frames just bounce around super buggy
1609873722,"After 35h of gameplay, went on holiday, came back, game just crashes at start up. This on top of all the bugs and glitches??? REALLY CDPR?! Dont buy this...at least wait what...5 years till its fixed?"
1609873458,"Night City is detail rich, authentic, and feels alive. The story and gameplay are immersive, varied, and absorbing. Amazing game."
1609873324,"Its good for the first playthrough, but the gameplay is very stiff and the playstyles of the 2 available are very underdeveloped. Also there is fuck-all choice you can have in the story until the you get a binary section at the end where you explicitly choose what ending you get based upon what sidequests you've done so far. 

Wait for a sale, and when its gets bugfixed and optimised. It's good, but it has been falsely advertised."
1609872841,yes
1609872680,א
1609872676,"For all the hype and delay surrounding this game, I thought that I was in store for the greatest RPG adventure of my life time.

I. WAS. WRONG.

This game is plagued by bugs, but that is not even the worst part. The worst part is that the game just isn't fun... in every other open world RPG I've played, I feel like I got more powerful as I visited every icon on my map and cleared it out. In this game? Not at all. It is more like ""Oh great I cleared a map marker, now I have to go manage my inventory for 5 minutes"". Inventory management all the time is NOT fun.

Furthermore, all of the skills and talent directions just seem so flat--nothing ever feels particularly unique or fun and once you are higher level and have gear every battle goes from stealth/hacking fun attempt to just running around shooting everyone.

As far as the story, they just keep throwing 100s of forgettable NPCs at you asking you to do missions all the time that you forget the main story (forget? by this point I already didn't care). Trying to finish the game feels like a complete chore rather than the gripping RPG adventure I hoped for.

Perhaps the games biggest sin is how much it gets in the way of you trying to have fun. Want to unlock every talent and skill to be OP? Too bad, you can't! Want to respec your points to try a different build? You can only respec part of your build and it costs an amount that would let you only probably do it once comfortably... I had to start a new game just to try another build, how is that fun?

So yeah, maybe the game looks pretty, but maybe someone should have worried more about making the game fun instead of stupid shit like letting me adjust my penis length on the character editor..."

1609872296,Disappointing but not bad. Its pretty solid game. Its just that its simply not what it was marked to be.
1609872254,"Honestly, really not as good as it was told to be, buggy, messy, rushed, it all doesn't feel good.
This game does have potential, but that potential wasn't really polished or perfected.
The game has a amazing story, but the stealth, cars, driving, fighting, feels sloppy and unpleasant.
And yes, I know, it's not your Triple A stealth, car, driving, fighting game, but it could've done a bit better.

I'd say give it a shot if you got money to burn."
1609873002,I dont wanna fucking die.
1609991267,Please wait until they've properly patched this game before you buy. It's an unfinished game with a well-made epilogue that you can't truly appreciate because the build-up was glitched and story elements were missing.
1609872093,"Cyberpunk is one of the weirdest experiences of my life. It's buggy- It runs not great- I've crashed a few times- I've been so angry at game breaking bugs. Yet I still sunk over 56 hours in it- beat it twice- and it lives rent free in my mind- Never in my life has such a flawed game come along where I can look at it and tell everyone ""yeah it's way too buggy don't bother getting it"" Yet then myself replay it, and have such a blast- where it's endings will leave me devastated and its npcs will be stuck in my mind for weeks after I've stopped playing it. It's such a enigma I don't even know what to say anymore. I hope they make a big boy update and fix all the real issues with it- cause what is here is great- its just covered in dirt and mess and this deserves better."
1609872028,"Not as buggy for me as others have made out, but is the game complete? Absolutely not- but you have a plethora of content waiting for you in game.
Where i would say they have missed out is in terms of immersion, the NPC's are clearly NPC's- there's little to no conversations to be had or 'human' detail in terms of coding personalities which is a shame because the plot-characters are the inverse, they are warm and intriging and many layers, for example there's a few missions that come out of no-where that are clearly proximity scripted but are done in such a great way that makes it feel organic and that's what this game needs more of; especially in terms of the city itself (which has despite their greatest efforts) failed to encapsulate a mega-city, it's much more empty than a super-populated metropolis should feel and has very little culture, you don't see the biker gangs out on parade or the fire brigades, ambulances, time or day based events like drinkers leaving the club after a band has played, the immersion is surface level and if you're playing this game to complete a FPS single player campaign that's alright; it's good and doesn't miss those things. If, however you're taking on the likes of Rockstar you better damn-well put the effort in because they will show you up on every account, especially when the game was marketed with the in game customisation as a feature, I mean i get to pick if my guy has either sexual organs but i can't pick his weight or height? I digress; It's a very beautifil game if you have the rig and monitor for it, HDR is a must as it takes away that bleak Blade Runner feel.

1609940076,"The game could have been a decades' milestone á la Half-Life or Skyrim. I hope it will grow in this direction. But the overall quality of the game and the marketing lies are above a tolerable limit. Trust and business liability is lost and responsible is the executive mangement of CDPR. Why is that? Because honorable managers take the responsibilty but also marketing would likely be correct when developers would have had enough time, or respectively more developers would have worked on the project. 

There is so much more potential in the game. The story, the missions and challenges are awesome but all end too early. This is worth than all the glitches. Most of the glitches are funny, a few annoying and <1% game breaking - but just for the last save file. This discussion is overheated. The most annoying thing in the game is the fucking mini map. It is so very annoying during every ride through the city that you switch to fast travel for most of the time. It prevents you of enjoying the beautiful world design because you miss all turns over and over again or you are mislead on a straight road by jumping lane advises for no reason! This was no feedback during testing?! I cannot believe this was no issue. 
Another major flaw is the uniform stupid behaviour of AIs, in particular car drivers. Examples are more than bearable on youtube - One might ask from which CDPR manager's engram the NPC received their mind? Getting out of the car and squat next to its door is not the solution to everything.

When it comes to PC games, the celebrity integration, so the appearance of real life actors in games, never convinced me, so I expected something major cringe worthy of Mr Reeves in the game. But I was very wrong -  well done integration, good script/role, awesome acting.
 
Note: The visuals (besides the many glitches) are breathtaking and the sounds are also on a new level - just beautiful! Let me repeat: The overall design of the characters, weapons, cars and their interior, the bikes. graffities, the city's architecture, their interior - tapestry, carpets the furniture is all very very good and nicely done. 'Even the trash looks smelly. The illumination is awesome. The clothes - absolutely insane lovely stuff - would wear IRL. 

Strength of the game: Immersion - by not switching characters (like in GTA) and the consequent 1st person perspective (optional while driving) you easily become V - the protagonist.

What is missing: speed adjusted augmented direction and turn advice (no mini map for driving), car/bike tuning, other apartment and real estate acquisition, npc bike riders, horizontal and vertical cyber-enhanced movement on walls, more underground levels (some might call them dungeons), more story, more relationship options and what about elves, ogers and such, well the Animals are already in, but honestly what about a little magic too?"
1609871465,"Yes its buggy, and damn near unplayable for some but look past it and it has a world, story, and characters that make it a great experience. If you have the money, buy the game"
1609871371,"*Not negative due to bugs!*

TLDR: Wait until this game is <$30. Fun story, not very immersive.

Review:
AI is the reason I give this a negative review. The trailers sell us a living city, with AI on day/night cycles, tons of micro interactions that make everything have a purpose. In reality you get a press ""F"" to talk and they say some dumb one-liner and thats it. The AI does the same animation on a loop and the city feels dead AF. The AI was supposed be a selling point, and is without a doubt what is holding it back (not going to mention the bugs because that can be fixed).

On a positive note, as others mentioned story is pretty good and the city is beautiful. Driving is great, first game where the car actually feels big and heavy and not a matchbox car (looking at you GTA)."
1609871292,"buns, glitchy boring mess"
1609871288,Games not finished.
1609871222,"The best game ever made in my book. With the newest Nvidia drivers, runs great and the more you play the more you fall in love with the game!"
1609871163,"id rather watch a movie then play this game so much f""""""""ing dialogue."
1609871145,"This game is fun, and the leveling is extensive. There are a lot of perks to explore and it seems you can play this game however way you see fit. There are still a few glitches but i have yet to encounter ""game breaking"" glitch. Sometimes people would be driving an invisible bike (i've only encountered that once). The minimap icons glitch out momentarily when you are tracking but it disappears as soon as you walk away from that spot.

The story seems good so far, but i only have 9 hrs of gameplay so we'll see. There are a lot of high level enemies around which to me is annoying. It may seem like there is a lot to do, but you'll end up getting one hitted if you walk down the wrong street or take to stop the wrong crime. So you'll always have to pay attention.

So the character customization is pretty good. Not the best (So far nothing comes close to APB) however certainly not the worst. You can turn your character into a tranny if thats what you're into, none of my business. Decent hair selection, okay tattoo options and ""cyberware"". And there are a few other different facial features to choose from, Scars, blemishes, etc. Overall you should be able to make a fairly unique character. I am also delighted by the clothing options thus far. It also seems like you can just keep upgrading your favourite piece of clothing, so i like that.

Graphics are okay, although I will say i can't play it using ultra raytracing setting (not yet, but i will be buying a rtx 3080 when i get the money/and or they become available again. But i did catch a glimpse of what ultra settings looked like, and tbh I'm not impressed. But again i didn't really take the time of fully experiencing it, so maybe other reviews are more accurate. I will update this part when I am able to. 

The only thing i think is missing is a 3rd person view. HOWEVER I read that there is a mod to give us that option, and i am going to look for it after i post this. Apparently it is quite good So i am optimistic about it.

So i am playing this game with a rtx 2060 super, and i average 36 fps during combat using high graphics settings. I will say you HAVE to install the latest nvidia drivers or performance will be garbage no matter what setting you have on. Because before i done that i was getting around 22 fps, and i almost stopped playing until i checked to see if i had the lastest driver installed.

With that said, this is NOT a sandbox game, if you expect something like GTA where you can just run around and do fun stuff unrelated to the story and side missions you will be disappointed. Night City is mostly there for the setting and atmosphere, which it does great. If you go in with the expectation to get a story driven RPG in the same spirit as the Witcher games I doubt you will be disappointed."

KINDA... i really liked the Katana combat. the concepts of hacking and having the tech integrated.. city has a LOT of cool concepts and behaviours. the idea i would give a 10/10, however i would have to give this game an overall rating of 4/10. this game needs A LOT more work to have the appropriate polish. I REALLY like that there is the COMMITTING to a game play path whether to a happy ending or a bad one.. i have beaten the game twice now as 2 different starting locations.. but the story still bottle necked right of the get go.. and both endings were rather anti-climatic.. i have not done the research to see how many different endings there are.. however the 2 i paths i have taken .. the endings sucked.. A LOT of screen tears falling through the floor. not being able to select and pick up items that are indicated that you can pick them up. impatient dialog interrupts the choices you make. interacting with non story line NPC's is VERY LACKING, each rando NPC off the street only has 2 phrases. cops SPAWN out of no-where when you get stars.. the progression is about 10 worse than GTA. DRIVING SUCKS!!!!!  Traffic is ALWAYS in your way, actual car handling is very poor, no room to drive around the cars.. the talent trees are rather limited i feel that they could have made a few better talents. looting is alright, but again i ran into not being able to actually select the unit i wanted to pick up.... im not saying this game sucks.. i am complaining about what things i noticed that make me feel this game was released a year ahead of when it should have been. i feel this game has GREAT potential amazing concepts.. i love all the ideas here.. .. but it isn't there yet.."

1609869191,"Finally, a game adaption of a pen and paper rpg that people actually will play.  Cyberpunk has been in development for a long time, and personally I avoided all the hype.  That doesn’t mean the game wasn’t on my radar, it just means that I didn’t think it was going to be the end all be all of video games.  All the controversy of the release date and such was lost on me, having lived through the release of almost every game since digital distribution has taken over.  Also having played at least 20 minutes of a Bethesda game, or rockstar game, I can handle buggy open world experiences.
With the amount of time put in this game’s development, I wasn’t sure what I was expecting though.  I wasn’t sure if it would be a legacy like Duke Nukem 3d, or the other type of legend like Duke Nukem forever.   But after a while of game time, I can’t really explain why I enjoy the game so much.  
	The gameplay is another first person type shooter, with some magical spells thrown in the mix if you want it.  Sorry it isn’t magic, I mean “hacking”.  You can “hack” people to cause their software to over heat and catch them on fire, so not fireball, you are not casting fire ball.  The gun play is enjoyable as well.  Like way more enjoyable than I expected.   Enemies aren’t usually just bullet sponges, with rewards for marksmanship on damage and other little various things that spice it up.  
	The entire time I have been playing it though, for the life of me, I can’t explain why I enjoy it so much.  Then it hits me.  this game’s character interactions and little stories are what hook you.  You can just level stuff up, gain xp for using skills, find different ways through levels.  It really tells a linear story, but you don’t realize that it is so linear.  The start and finish have so many fun little paths and things to do.  The only other game I really played like this, that just hooked me for no real reason, was Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines.  In my opinion, this game is the heir to that game, and by god you will laugh at some of the random little glitches.  My personal favorite is sometimes when I rotate the camera, piles of trash explode.  Doesn’t effect the game play, but it makes me laugh.
	To sum this game up in a few words, if you like Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines, Borderlands, or Skyrim, there is a very very good chance you will like this game.  If you don’t though, and you are expecting Citizen Kane in video game form, I think you will just have to keep waiting.  Maybe the next Mass Effect, Destiny, Duke Nukem, or Colonial Marines game will do it for you. 
"
1609869166,"Writing this during the comedown phase after finishing the game may not be the most reasonable thing to do, but here we are. 

Yes, I would recommend this game.  While I've got my issues with it, they're mostly about how I wish we could stop pretending that happy endings aren't desirable any more and bring those back without needing to add a pinch of bitter.

Otherwise? I've had a BLAST. I didn't expect Cyberpunk to to scratch my stealth itch or that I'd grow so attached to V, but as it is, the game had everything I needed and was worth every penny.

Glitches were minimal (Roach possessing cars, mostly). Acting superb. Night City stunning. And emotions were had."

1609869496,"This is going to be a long and probably more top-down review than I would like to write within the limits of Steam review boxes. I am a long-term gamer in various games including city builders, RPGs, open-world games, and small indie games as well as many hours and effort into modding games into different games over the years. 

Where to start? Skyrim I guess is the best analogy of Cyberpunk 2077, both in technical and marketing levels. Recalling from a long time ago, Skyrim was one of the most expensive games made at the time, part of the cost being incurred from marketing and relatively long development phase of 6 years. The end result at launch was a familiar-ly moddable engine, abysmal bugs at times, and an enjoyable experience for the layman. Overall it can be said ""Not perfect, not bad"" as an end-opinion of the game. You probably have a different opinion of the game in the years afterward but overall it can be said to be good experience.

Now where does Cy2077 start in this context? For one, marketing in recent years has been increasingly been getting better at drawing in crowds but horrible to understand the core product being offered. Cy2077 does not really offer ""relationships like in real life"" but it offers RPG standard dialog to get the same experience. Cy2077 does not offer all the features advertized, but what's there is playable, gameplay is solid, and I find myself adjusting to different strategies as the game story moves on. Cy2077 does not offer in-depth cyberpunk expectations that we have gotten used to over the years, instead it presents a future that is as realistic to humane expectation within the alleged development cycle. 

Being in development I can understand how difficult these systems are to implement, even more when a core mechanic of the overall project fails and everything else seems to fail. Having taking some project management courses and reading into software construction, I understand that by having just one or two systems fails can delay and implicate the whole project. In Cy2077 you see this problem often. 

Right after you leave the elevator from the main start area, the first bug I saw out the door were improperly textured trees, allegedly the texture did not use the correct LOD texture, or was not marked to despawn when not in view of the player. This situation repeats itself a lot throughout the game, not in term of clipping trees, despawning cars and people, but problems with a modern feature in video games called render clipping (If memory serves right). where a scene is rendered only up to what the player can see within their field of view. Everything outside this view is either downscaled, removed from scene, or compressed to save resources. What can be seen as the frequent culprit, even on console is the failure of this mechanic where things either show up or they show up with the wrong LOD model. The next one is the physics engine fighting itself with objects, either through LOD models being rushed and not properly closed to avoid clipping. Another frequent issue that either might be or not are FPS-tied events, but occasionally things fail to act when they are needed. 

All of these problems reek of rushed development. Unsurprisingly these problems would have at least added 6 months of development and also depend on the ""one man army"" developer to have the patience to fix this. Seeing these problems however, from my personal point of view and opinion did not affect my opinion of the game greatly, in fact it's probably something of the message that cyberpunk wants us to know in some fashion. 

Where Cy2077 is good at is its story and the pacing of what your decisions do. I don't feel like if I backtrack a save three or 4 saves ago I would be getting the same ending, at least the details will be different. The story really drives it through at times, and well you can have more fun on side quests as well as locating the rare legendary items to make the experience better. There's also the appreciated mechanic where if you really like a particular weapon or item, you can upgrade it and retain its usabilty for a longer time than in other RPG games. I detested Borderlands 2's RNG mechanics since it felt more of an artifical means of  generating more weapon variants at the expense of the idea of the game. ""Let's farm more DPS!"" does not correlate to gameplay when I go out in the real world, and unless that was the core idea of a RPG game shouldn't be universally applicable. 

In the end, Cy2077 does want to do one thing in the end, that's everywhere when we bring the antagonist (and side-kick?) Johnny in the picture in an explanation of what is really going on in the world of Cy2077, weeds really do grow back. Unfortunately as of the time of this review it becomes a somewhat sad fact that some of the events that happen in the game that led to its misery in creation, literally and in-game, are present in the real world. 

In conclusion, the average layman would probably not enjoy their game having frustrating problems done by a questionable upper management. Maybe it's not worth the $60 that it goes for, but neither should it be thrown in the trash for items clipping through. There is an experience to be had, however you have to work through to get it. Either find guides on fixing the issues it has or waiting a few months until they fix it. Nothing in life doesn't seem to come for free, and Cy2077 might take that a bit too literally. 

As of the moment I have not gotten an ending, presumably my 30FPS (With 10 FPS lows) is slowing down my progress. I will update this review if I have a chance if the ending did bring the story to a satisfying close.

Feel free to rage and throw @#$% at this review, either way I believe some discussion is required, nothing is really ever set in stone anyway."

That being said, please bear in mind there are a lot of bugs and glitches in this game; they range from harmless physics glitches such as floating debris, to functions being annoyingly locked out. I would say however that they've all been fixed by reloading the game so far, so they haven't been game breaking."

Anyways, the game itself is actually pretty good. I'll break it down a little bit.

Story, no spoilers: (I'm about 10% in, been playing a lot of side quests) so far is pretty good. I saw a lot of hate come from how it is difficult to understand some of the concepts or things that are happening (Not just in the story but in the world) and my direct response to that is READ THE IN GAME JOURNAL. The journal is in the main menu of your character screen. That literally explains everything. The corps, the vehicles, the country, the city, EVERYTHING! It also gives background on the other characters in the story, which allows you to connect to them (Another complaint I saw was characters you couldn't connect to because of lack of backstory). Another thing that helps is when you get to a computer to read what's on the web. A lot of world building comes from the journal, and the rest comes from the web (Kind of like our world now). All of the ""websites"" are quick reads and often interesting.


Mechanics: Playing on mouse and keyboard and I have no complaints. The only thing is there is no walk button so you are always kind of running (But not sprinting). To solve this problem you can play on controller. Everything (For me) runs smoothly and I have no major complaints, and I'm sure the ones I do have are cybernetic upgrades so I'm not going to bother complaining. Driving is a bit like driving a boat at times, but it's easy to get past that. Combat is pretty easy to get down.


Graphics: My rig doesn't run them at max, but I am just under max. Looks great, I've come across no major graphical glitches. Smooth. I think the hotfix also helped a lot.


Overall: Great experience. I'd say a 8/10. If I hadn't read the journal and looked for world building it would be probably a 5/10, just to give you an idea as to how much is explained (If you are confused). The only game to get 10/10 for me is RDR2, if that puts this game into any kind of perspective."
1609866726,Great game
1609866681,dope
1609866670,eh it is ok can be better some bug but it is fun so yea
1609866568,"The stuff people are mad about is mostly valid criticism, but it's still easily one of the best RPGs and games of all time. If you can't deal with the bugs and other problems, that's totally fine, but come back in 6 months or a year and give it a shot. New Vegas and Kingmaker are also top 5 all-time RPGs for me, and neither of them functioned on release either. 

In regards to conditions at CD Projekt Red- as a company, they absolutely deserve boycotts and probably a lot worse than that for what they did to their workers. That said, the amount of love and work put into it is incredibly evident. This shit is art, and if you consider games to be anything close to a valid art form, you owe it to the devs to experience it. Willing or not, it's clear that blood sweat and tears were poured into this and the least you can do is appreciate that.

"
1609866472,good game
1609866393,Just play the damn game.
1609866361,This game is unfinished. Missions are broken. AI is very very dumb and a lot more. Wait a couple months maybe they'll pull a No Man's Sky.
1609866332,"great atmosphere, sub quests are amazing"
1609866257,Even with the bugs I still really like this game!
1609866212,"It's a real shame that the ""next step in Open World gaming"" completely ignored all the previous steps that have lead us to where we are today. This game has absolutely failed in every category of previous titles in the genre, from it's horrible AI and it's empty-shell of a world to it's fake choices for it's on-rails storyline.

The game might seem great if you just stick to the game's main script and don't question why it never deviates despite what dialog options you have chosen (1 that progresses 2 that circle back around to choice 1)... the second you go off the rails and try to enjoy the open world you'll quickly learn just how bland and empty it is. Even games from the Playstation 1 era had more substance.

What side-missions there are are abysmal. There's a lot of them sure, but they went with quantity over quality, nearly all of them are generic locations with little to no interaction that only exists as shooter fodder.

A sidequest in Skrim sends you on an adventure, a random npc staring at a house on the street had you going in and being manipulated by an evil god sending you on a quest for an epic mace... Cyberpunk has you kill a room full of people and hyperloot a bunch of generic trash for 3 minutes.

Fallout had better conversation and world building. Fallout/Skyrim had better melee. GTA had better driving, vehicle customization and civilian AI. Saints Row had better character clothing options. they all had better character customization. Yakuza 0 had better minigames and honestly a better story. Mass Effect had better romance and character development. Watchdogs had better hacking. The Witcher had better and more in-depth sidequests. All of the above had better side content.

This isn't even mentioning the bugs. Compare this game's world with that of RDR2 and the whole thing just falls apart as the biggest missed opportunity of this generation, if ever.

The game as an Openworld RPG compaired to similar titles is an absolute flop, it's just people who have no idea what it means to play an RPG that are content with it. For a single-player story game, it's decent, but they advertised it as an openworld RPG and that it is not."
1609866043,There are some bugs but if you have a good enough rig the graphics are amazing. Game play is pretty cool and the different options and side stories are pretty amazing. They don't feel like fetch quests because each side quest offers a story.
1609865794,"Highly recommend, this game is great. 
Glitches are very minor for PC"
1610024536,"Great game despite it´s flaws. If you want open world to fool around, this most likely is not the game for you. Story is the main event here, both the main story and side storylines.
I encountered some minor bugs which were merely amusing and appeared rarely enough not to be immersion or game breaking. During almost 80 hours of playtime game crashed only 3 times so can't really complain about that either. 
If you have the horsepower to run this on higher settings and ray tracing turned on, it´s easily one of the most graphically impressive games so far."
1609865491,save your 80 bucks this is a pos
1609865411,Definitely worth the buy.
1609865302,"So I finished the game, and steam asks, would you recommend this game to other players?

And I'm sorry to say, I won't. 

I played with a AMD Ryzen 7 3700X, 32gb of ram and 3060TI. It ran at a constant 60 fps with everything pretty much maxed out. So it's not because of performance issues that I wouldn't recommend it.
Also, only once did I experience a game breaking bug where the keycard I needed for some elevator fell through the floor. 1 reload and it was solved.

So why won't I recommend it? Just because of the very poorly the entire world feels. NPC's are retarded, the whole body mod/weapon system is boring. I didn't realy rush through the game, but I didn't need any of the body mods. I would have liked to get a cool car, but that requires so much money that it's not worth is.
Also the cars drive like shit. 

Yea the game looks pretty nice when you stop and look around for a second, but that's not why I buy games. I would much prefer the game to have GTA 5 level of graphics, but a story line that would suck me in, and leave me sad that the ride is over. I finished the game and all I could think was, ""meh"""
1609865269,10/10
1609865253,I love it for the visuals.
1609865220,"Despite all the bugs, the game is super fun and really immersive/realistic in my eyes."
1609865196,Cyberbugs 2077
1610051494,"This is by far the most controversial title of recent memory. No other game generated this much of hype, hate, love, disdain, and other emotions from a wide range of people, outlets, and journalists where it spawned numerous opinions that barely reflect the reality anymore. 

So where to start? It is safe to say that the single, biggest issue with Cyberpunk is that it was marketed and hyped up to biblical heights, comparable only to vaporware like Half Life 3. Living up to these unrealistic expectations were literally impossible and further fueled by false marketing promises on game features and content that never seen the light of day. 

Cyberpunk undoubtedly arrived in an unfinished and broken state with hundreds of bugs, glitches and glaring performance issues that are not in-line with the min/recommended specs. The game is virtually unplayable on last-gen consoles and low tier PCs even though it was marketed as such.

This is where most reviews will stop and mention that “but, but but… Skyrim, Wither 3, No Mans Sky etc. was a buggy mess and I’m sure CDPR will fix the bugs in no time” and yes, that is probably true. CD Project RED is a 100% committed to fix the bugs and provide steady updates. I truly believe that over time this might be a new No Mans Sky scenario which is now widely accepted as gaming’s ultimate redeem act. 

However, there are glaring game design decisions, not bugs that will probably never be fixed especially after launch. It is financially unfeasible to redesign the game and implement what was originally the vision and marketed for years. Putting also in context the shacky 8 years of development with multiple redesigns and scope creep.

[u]Wake up Samurai, we got a linear storyline to burn[/u]

The developers of this game had no clue what type of game they wanted to create. They liked the open world idea from the Witcher but wanted a linear story driven experience also, packed into a style of a first-person shooter. What ultimately resulted in Cyberpunk is now more of a story driven linear Looter-Shooter with RPG elements rather than a Next-gen RPG experience they originally advertised, falling short in every genera aspect, never able to fully deliver in any of it. 

The RPG aspect of the game is very limited, cut-back and ultimately unfulfilling for fans of the genera. You have very limited decisions with an on-rail storyline and most of your customizations you can do barely affect the outcome. Lifepath choices, a big advertisement point, is an ultimately disappointing feature that does not drive narrative or provide anything of value other than an additional voice line. Branching dialogue options are basic, strait forward and does not allow for any roleplaying whatsoever. 

[u]It’s a city of false dreams…[/u]

Driving or walking through Night City gives the impression of a breathtaking, alive place which have never been seen before in video games. Pedestrians shopping at kiosks, cars passing by, managers arguing over the phone, police investigating a crime scene, local gang members taking a break etc. A beautiful, non-choreographed and immersive place to be in.

But than you stop. 

You realize that NPC’s are lifeless, don’t do much at all, have no daily schedule like it was promised and unable to properly react to any player action. Night City is just a pretty, artificial bio-scenery that has no depth beyond its surface. 

AI pathfinding and car driving is abysmal. Nearly any action that sets of an NPC from their predetermined path will cause the AI to freeze up, freak out or to do some other weird immersion breaking action.

Complete lack of Police AI wanted system, and chase mechanic with an unrealistic enemy spawn mechanic that lets police pop up in your field of vision. It is confirmed that there is no Police Ai pathfinding/driving mechanic developed so they left out the whole feature at launch resulting in the most ridiculous and utterly broken Police response. Even 2001 GTA3 had way better police and chasing system in this regard. This function is utterly broken and clearly taken out before launch as in 2019 they expressed in detail to the press of the complex mechanics of police response and even sort of bounty hunters (Max Tac) going after the player. 

[u]…and I am a big dreamer.[/u]

There are hundreds of minor or significant quality of life issues, balance problems and missing features or cut content.

Other than the main story or the side quest there is very little offered to enrich the experience and immersion. There are no minigames or side activities and you cannot really bond with your hard-earned NPC’s and love interest or do stuff together. There is 1 type of racing and 1 type of brawling and nothing else.
 
Apartments are useless, with very limited things you can do in it. No decoration, customization or functionality that would want you to visit said apartment often. You also cannot purchase more desired flats, though you earn some basic ones throughout the story. Cars cannot be collected and displayed in a garage nor they cannot be customized, even though on the street you see several variants of different models. 
Entire parts of the city are blocked from the player and the metro/subway system (featured in the marketing demo) is completely cut. 

[u]“Wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle”[/u]

With all this said on what Cyberpunk Is not let me tell you what Cyberpunk really Is. 

[b] Night City is an incredibly immersive, well-crafted place where spending time is simply fun[/b] . The atmosphere completely sucks you in, wanting to spend just a bit more time with each session. The gigs and side quest are wonderfully hand-crafted and often charmingly bizarre. Characters are interesting, lovable and voice acted to perfection, Jackie, Judy, Panam, Jhonny, River and many more are memorable and well developed. 

It’s exceptional art design, graphics and mesmerizing scenery will make you awe and gaze in wonder at every step. The music is superb with a banger soundtrack that will crank up the mood of every situation. 

Gunplay and weapon design are well done and enjoyable. Even though the combat is very bullet spongy, easy to exploit with lackluster weapon customization, the guns are still relatively fun to use and do the job.

The game undoubtedly is a buggy, unfinished mess with so much more that could have been added to enrich the experience, but still, I want to go back. I want to spend just 5 minutes more in this uniquely weird and bizarre world. Finish one more gig, explore the shoreline of Pacifica or walk in Kabuki market one last time.

Unfortunately for the features that were promised, the lackluster character building, RPG options, lifeless NPCs and broken police, there really is no immediate and obvious fix and it is hard to see how CDPR would even have the means to address any of them. 

There is great value to be found here. An immersive world with a great story and memorable characters. However, the only way that you can enjoy it if you accept it’s shortcomings and limitations. If you have ceiling high expectations or think that this game is anything like GTA, Skyrim or The Witcher, then you will be disappointed. Cyberpunk is Cyberpunk, and it plays by its rules. I am not saying I don’t want this game to be different, to be more, but you have to understand that it just simply isn’t. And accept, hell, love it for that fact.  

The glitches and bugs in the current state will often break the immersion and pull you out of this magnificent world, which is truly a shame. I would recommend waiting a few months, as stated before CD Project already expressed that they aim to fix everything and provide content DLC from Q1 2021.

It is uncertain by great margin how all of this will affect the multiplayer portion. Until then, however there is another gig waiting for me in Night City.

[b] 10/7 Good[/b]"
1609864874,Really fuckin good but could be much better if the public could just chill for a fuckin minute and didn't force CD Projekt RED to release the game to early
1609864845,Came for tits stayed for the tits
1609864865,"I have been waiting for this game since before they communicated their intention to make it a video game, when I began to narrate the role-playing game ""Cyberpunk 2013"" (around ninety-something ...) ...

* The story: 9/10 (for me the whole issue of the soft and the soul is transcendent)
* Technical quality: 2/10 (too many bugs in its initial deployment)
* The gameplay of the open world: 1/10 (there are hardly any repetitive tasks left and get better items once the plot ends, but absolutely no RPG)
* Stakeholder management: 0/10 (Lots of unmade clarities that led to misleading launch messages)
** Total 3/10

It is evident that the game is a Viable Minimum (term of work in software dllo) but not clarifying it prior to deployment in production, and planting so many false expectations that one assumed lists at launch, have undoubtedly made a game that could having achieved everything, in a game that has been enjoyable (I closed with 2 of the final 5 I understand there are available) but not revolutionary.
We just have to wait for them to add everything that is needed, it shows that there are things that they left planted as a base to add functionalities later (buttons that are obviously interactive, but without interaction yet, etc.).

At least apparently the criticism that is raining down on the company about the game is working, because as of today I have tried to replicate the nasty bugs that I witnessed at the beginning, and several have been corrected.
I thank the entire critical community for making themselves heard; without criticism, there is no improvement

I will continue to better narrate Cyberpunk's Tabletop role-playing game, although it has been nice to see in part some of its background code and published as a video game (although several of the wounds that ProjectRed did to this great TRPG hurt me)."
1609864760,"Wake the f*ck up, Samurai 

We got a city to render."
1609864669,Far cry in the future
1610068307,"Alright, first and foremost; this game is still buggy. Does that mean it's a bad game?

Honestly, no. The game is good, if you can get past the bugs that everyone crows about. All that it will take to make this game great, is a few fixes from the Devs. But, even without that; the game is still good, if running on a decent PC.

Pros:
Combat is top-notch for this type of game.
Soundtrack is good for this Genre.
Story-line is very good, and you can tell that it was what the developers were going for with it.
Character Creation, at the beginning of the game is up there with a few titles.
Customization is fairly good, even if I think it needs just a tad bit more love.

Cons (So far anyways...):
It is still a buggy mess. (Though I can happily report that one of those bugs saved my bacon. Lol, Car fell from the sky and murdered a sniper for me.)
Customization (Clothing, Weapons), again... I feel like this needs a bit more attention, even if it is good enough.
Story Cinema Length. ... ... ... The story is great, but the length of every bit is so far up there; that it should be considered more of a movie. (Of the 18 hours I have played with my Male Corpo Samurai, only 6 or 8 hours were spent with actual playing.) Keep that in mind when you want to play this game, the story is freaking long; though it is still good imo.
NPC-AI... ... ... ... do I really need to go into this. There have been a few Patch-Fixes, but they are still just this side of Retarded Puppets. Drones are the smartest enemies in the game, and that is only cause they can fly.
-Edit of NPC-AI: They are a decent bit smarter now, though... I still feel like they are dumb in certain things. Spawning being one of them...-

Do I recommend Cyberpunk 2077? Yes. Yes I do. It just needs a little more TLC to make it what everyone was expecting. I hope that CDPR fixes the game, but then again... 2020 was a POS year for most people. lol."
1609864398,Da.
1609864380," I was super excited for this game throughout 2020 as it suited my love for futuristic (and also realistic) world scenarios and I had high expectations of it due to CDPR and their Witcher games like many did. There's a lot of problems in the game. Many that are already stated but I'll only mention the ones that in my opinion are complete immersion breakers, disappointing and the biggest reason why I'm giving a negative review to this game.  

 The game has a really good emotional story, yes, and I personally love Johnny Silverhand's implementation into it BUT the story becomes linear because of him and the ability to choose your path from the start is only but of an illusion. Its obvious many things are either unfinished or removed from the game and one of them was the story before Keanu Reeves and personally for me that was their biggest mistake. Giving an rpg a linear story. I'm not saying Keanu shouldn't have been in the game but the story directors should've constructed it differently(unless they had no choice). Aside the unfinished and scrapped parts that could be fixed the story itself can't and that is my biggest disappointment. And lets don't mention Witcher 3 (that needs to have a linear story) has more impactful choices that can either ruin your mood or make you happy from the smallest side quest to the main quests.

 Speaking of unfinished I've tried my hardest to ignore all the flaws ai has. The combat is interesting, especially the hacking mechanic where you can become super op but it's just not satisfying and a big immersion breaker when the ai acts so primitively and barely tries to be hard to hit. I endured it throughout my entire playthrough until the ending which completely ruined it for me and the bugs didn't help. Many sequences like breakthroughs and reinforcements didn't happen and they were just sitting in one place waiting to be aggroed. The music also sometimes just stopped playing which completely ruined the feeling of badassery that I should have been experiencing then.

 Basic things that every open world game has are completely nonexistent. At the start I knew that some are missing but I didn't expect it to be to a such extend and it bothered me more and more. Some big parts of the game that are often talked about like braindances are nothing more than junk and there are barely any random encounters too.

Sadly the pros of the game are vastly overshadowed by the cons like the music and its beauty but that doesn't make a good game and I understand the drama this game had during its production. How it was terribly mismanaged/crunched and the devs are not to be blamed for that. The game is unfinished and buggy and I really don't know how they would fix all of those problems but my recommendation is to wait for the patches and then think of buying it then.
 
"
1609864173,I think that this is a solid singleplayer rpg. I am enjoying exploring the world.
1609864053,"At this stage I wouldn't pay full price for it; it's a servicable RPG with servicable gameplay and a servicable story with some interesting characters every once in a while. The city itself is marvellous though, if only that immersion wasn't ruined quite so frequently by wonky bugs. All in all, I'd rate it 6/10 which wouldn't justify full price for me again; maybe this time I'll actually learn not to buy any game at release."
1609863766,"Wanted to be something more, ended up somewhere in between heaven and hell. 
But when you are in heaven, simply the best. 

Just get the right hardware to reach the gates."
1609863635,"Buggy. If the developers clean up the bugs, it'll be amazing. Even at the time of the writing, with the buggy state it's in, this game is good."
1609863479,"Full of lies and deceit. Game is garbage but has an OKAY story - that takes way to long to do because there are so many separate dialogue sections that take forever to get through. 

Boring, repetitive, and full of LIES. 

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. 100HOURS in and STILL NO WAY IT WAS WORTH IT."
1609863423,"Game bad.
Keanu good."
1609863381,"Absolutely love this game, glitches and all. That being said I run it on a pretty high-end PC so your experience may differ which is a shame. If I had horrible performance and the glitches it might be a different story but for now I can deal with some T-posing. Honestly don't know if I can recommend or not, guess it depends on the amount of patience you have."
1609863371,"This game is amazing. It launched with many bugs but I have never experienced a crash to desktop in this game. The worst bugs I've had were some quest triggers not activating causing me to have to reload a previous save to advance the quest. This does not happen very often however. 

Game performance has been mediocore as I average 45 FPS with a Ryzen 5 2600 and a GTX 970 on low settings with medium textures. Keep in mind that my PC is not top tier and my GPU is 6  almost 7 years old. 

The game truly shines in musical score and writing with an interesting of somewhat convoluted story supported with phenomenal character writing. The music is on point with the worst being repetitive combat music. 

honestly 8/10
With a better GPU probably 9/10
All bugs fixed 10/10

Once all the bugs get fixed and CD project red releases additional tweaks and quality of life changes people will say this game is one of the best to ever come out."
1609863492,"[h1] The Prologue -- Part 1/5 [/h1]
[!!!] This is a long review. Part 5 ends with a concise, summed-up opinion on whether it is worth the AAA price-tag.

This review is written by someone with little to no expectations. Despite my awareness of the game ever since the Bullets trailer, and my urges to eventually get to play it(especially whenever updates dropped), I always kept the prediction at the back of my mind that, at its best, it'll be a futuristic Witcher 3.

Admittedly, my taste for games can often be as daring as the British's food palette. Mild. So keep that in mind.


[h1] The Good -- Part 2/5 [/h1]
--> The narrative! Oh, I think Cyberpunk 2077 could've been a contender for one of the best games out there, had it mostly scrapped trying to be an open-world RPG. Imagine a world where Cyberpunk takes us on a ride of a Mafia II esque nature - would be a sight to behold. And it is, somewhat, should you focus only on the [b]main missions[/b] and some of the more narrative-driven side quests.

--> Most deserving of my praise is specifically the [b]ending sequences[/b], a part the game calls 'past the point of no return', where the free-roam aspect is taken away and you're left with a rather thrilling final showdown of the story presented.

--> The synthwave/retrofuture/whatever vibes I get to experience just chilling driving down some road are certainly something to mention. The sit in a car, listen to the radio go off, have the time of your life without progressing to the actual game must've how I racked up quite a bit of my hours. The only game that's given me the same feeling thus far has been GTA V. Nighttime on a badlands road with the cityscape on the horizon is just perfect.

--> Combat gameplay is fun! It's what makes most of the game's gigs(quests with no narrative or much substance) actually fun to grind out. I would advise playing it [b]loud and fast[/b] to get the most out of Cyberpunk's 2077 combat, with a katana cyberpsycho speed build being my favourite, but guns certainly do not fade all that much beside the samurai cosplay.


[h1] The Bad -- Part 3/5 [/h1]
A lot of Cyberpunk 2077's features seem so [b]cardboard and makeshift[/b]. It has fallen victim to the ever looming darkness over the game industry where the business takes precedence over the developers' vision and wishes. This includes but isn't limited to these issues...

--> The lifepath system is extremely underdeveloped. The intro quests are only a few minutes each, only to get shuffled into the very same [b]generic mercenary path[/b]. The lifepath-specific dialogue lines are an illusion of difference, because they make no impact on the quests other than flavour - the same goals are achieved with or without using the 'knowledge' of a certain lifepath. Having played through corpo and street kid, I have to say I enjoyed the corpo the most, with some of the 'I own you and this city' dialogue lines delivered very well. But even that falls flat when the corpo-specific line ends and you're suddenly, rather non-immersively, thrown back into speaking as the generic mercenary.

--> [b]Player choice falls[/b] only to the endings. If there are tidbits of choice during the narrative's middle, they only reveal themselves at the very end. Up until the 'point of no return', the story is extremely linear. I feel more should've been done to have several routes leading up to the endings.

--> Speaking of routes, [b]the approach to levels[/b] seems extremely more [b]shallow[/b] than it is to be expected as well. Often at times the only difference between a techie and a solo musclehead will only be whether you break a door open with your bare hands or 'hack' it open.

--> Braindance(a virtual reality esque technology where you relive recorded memories as your own), as a feature that was spoken about so much(especially within the game world itself), was only used a few times for a plot device's sake only. I'm hesitant to include the lack of braindances' presence in the bad, because, well, the [b]tediousness[/b] of doing them those few times for quests made me doubtful whether they'd be enjoyable even if they were available for anything other than moving the plot forward where necessary. So, instead, I'm including them because I hated them.

--> The [b]romances[/b] in the game felt like they [b]could've been more[/b]. I think Meredith Stout's presence(or lack thereof) was what got me the most. She's a really cool character, a mean corporation lady not necessarily meant to be likable at first. But you can side with her from the get-go, and if you say the right things, she says something of the likes 'perhaps we'll work together in the future'. That specific line was what hooked me to be waiting for her calls or messages like any other quest/gig giver's(fixers, as the game calls them), only to, for the course of the entire game, get a [spoiler]single sex scene and nothing else. Thanks, I guess.[/spoiler]

--> For a city that prides itself in looks and fashion(as mentioned in the character creation screen), they really [b]messed up the cosmetic aspect[/b]. Sure, it's a 1st person game, but boy if I don't want my character looking good every time I pop that inventory screen open. If you don't want to get one-shot by most enemies, you'll want the best gear you can get your hands on, and with the randomised way the gear works, you'll be looking like someone who's going on a date with someone you really hate and thus put on the most embarassing, out of touch clothing you could find in your local dumpster fire.

[h1] The Ugly -- Part 4/5 [/h1]
[i]""And... Oh dear lord, they never fixed the bugs. And there are so [b]many[/b] of them."" - Internet Historian on F76[/i]

--> Most of the bugs I experienced weren't game breaking. Missing items from npcs' hands, npcs and cars sinking into the ground, cars behaving extremely strangely. Sometimes called cars being delivered by catapult. Or staying in the air above me for some reason(like Roach on the rooftop, except there was no rooftop). Some loot wasn't pickable, but I didn't care that much as it was common junk.

--> I got a lot sourer, however, when I couldn't exit a braindance and had to do it all over again, or when some quests failed to progress due to some mishap. The most soul crushing moment was to get my hands on such a specific bug that I had to [b]restart my playthrough entirely 60 hours in[/b], because for whatever reason, at least 1 or 2 hostile npcs in every encounter/quest/gig could no longer be killed(but they could still kill me). Research on forums has me thinking it's something to do with corpo lifepath and legendary quickhacks, but that's what makes it so bad in the first place - I don't even know enough about it to report it.

--> Performance is a tough topic to speak of. One machine to play it with is only so much experience, right? Certainly not for an opinion - but here goes: I think it was only ever [b]optimised for high-end rigs[/b]. My mid-tier, if you could call it that in 2021, 1060/i5 needed some heavy adjustments in the nvidia control panel and the game itself to help run it smoothly. There are some steam user based guides on that, so make sure to check them out if you're playing on an average computer.


[h1] The Epilogue -- Part 5/5 [/h1]

All in all, I'd give it a [b]7/10[/b].

It leaves a lot to be desired, but it's been a lot of fun for me. I'm a very specific type of player, perhaps best explained in the hours I've sunk into GTA V and Skyrim: decent narratives are super fun for me. The explore->kill->loot cycle is fun for me, too. And honestly, the trademark feeling of emptiness at the credits screen is the sole seller. It's not worth its full price should you expect it to change your life, but it is worth it as one of the many things you'll pick up, spend some time on, appreciate it, then move on."
1609875965,"Personally, I've never spent this much thinking about a review for a game. It's tough, because you have two very different sides of the same coin - two very different sides to which I moderately concur. I really did enjoy the game, but at the same time I can't disagree with the considerable amount of bugs, lies and undelivered promises. With this said I wished there was a ""neutral"" option, but due to the fact I don't want to see the negatives even more normalised on the game industry - I can't recommend [i]Cyberpunk 2077[/i] as of now. 

Again, I had a lot of fun when it worked - but just because it's CDPR doesn't mean I'll give them a green pass. I've changed my mind about a lot of games before, so if I see noticeable changes in the future - I'm more than happy to be convinced and subsequently modify/change this review. Until then, here're the two conflicting views I have:

""CDPR has restricted the review process of the game, claimed that there would be no mandatory crunch, lied about the game running well on last-gen consoles - there're even a considerable amount of promised features not present in the final product! [i]Cyberpunk 2077[/i] feels unpolished too, a world full of bugs which lacks on interactivity: these are things other major companies do and unlike CDPR, they don't get away with it.""

""Yeah but the game was delayed countless times as well to which fans reacted by sending death threats to developers; [i]The Witcher 3[/i] had its problems too - they'll be fixed, have you looked at [i]No Man's Sky[/i]? Besides, when it works you can see the amount of care and detail it has been put! There's a good game underneath all these issues.""

I'd say - choose your pill. Or take both."
1609862912,"This is next gen!

Yes, sometimes its buggy , and yes sometimes you need to restart the game.
But what a story , what a world , it is so unbelievable alive. 

Never ever have seen that in a game before. And most bugs are fixed due to updates. Its really playable! 
Buy this game in submerge yourself in a world that is close to RL. 

"
1609862754,"Buggy as hell, AI is a joke, GTA San andreas has better AI then this dumpster fire"
1609862416,"Pretty buggy, broken and a lot of features are missing, but the story is really good. Some of the combat is fun too. Driving bad."
1609862408,"good game! some bugs here and there, nothing game breaking but some are annoying, and hope they will b fixed. good story overall, specially in the side content. one thing, i wish it would be clearer how choices impact story outcomes."
1609862386,"This game is great. All the butthurt on the internet is because of the immense hype the game garnered in the years before its release. 
Sure, it isn't perfect. It's way too buggy for a finished product, especially since it was delayed like five times. Some gameplay elements are broken. I'm sure CDPR will fix it in time. 
Also, I don't really care how the game runs on the ps4, I don't own one, as I'm exclusively a pc gamer. 

HOWEVER, the game is still an absolute joy to play. The atmosphere is amazing, the setting is great, the characters are fleshed out (Keanu's character was amazing in my playthrough, and his acting was great), the story is interesting, original and superbly written. 
The graphics are great, although the game could be optimized a bit more. Don't have an RTX capable card, but it still looked amazing.  The music and ambiance is stellar, as well.
Also, the game isn't too short, in the same way Skyrim wasn't too short. You can speed through the story fairly quickly (approx. 20h), but if you take the time to enjoy the side-gigs, the exploration and the lore, it's gonna take a lot more time. It took me 50h to finish the game, and I didn't do all the side quests, and I intend to replay the game as a different faction, because it actually changes the game.

All in all, a great, but a bit flawed game. I enjoyed it immensely, and will probably keep playing it for a long time."
1609862379,"Game play, story, characters, setting, combat, builds, all amazing. The game itself is good, bugs and such take it from a 10/10 to a 9/10 or 8.5/10. still highly recommend."
1609862362,I give this game 5 Johnny Silverhand reload animations/5
1609862355,nice
1609862330,Despite the bugs the game has really good story content and great aesthetic which makes exploring fun. Combat has potential to be better with tweaks and bug fixes bug. The characters/voice acting in this game stands out and interesting. As you explore the city and play the game keep a lookout for npc interactions which would make for some funny moments. With future bug fixes and more story content the game has potential to be better. Overall would recommend for people who likes story driven games.
1609862312,"At the point of writing this review i've played more than a 100 hours during my first playthough covering most if not all of the sidequests and one ending of the mainstory.

Where it shines
+Graphically stunning and beautiful
+Good Character writing
+Good Story Plot
+Plenty of Side Quests

Where it needs to improve
+Bugs,Bugs Bugs
+Talent Tree
+Vehicles
+NPC AI
+More interesting Side Quests



The game is graphically impressive and makes good use of ray tracing so its a definate boon if you are lucky to have acquired any of the new 3000 series cards.However, you don't need a top of the line rig to run this game. I've tested it on a laptop with a 1660ti card and Night City is still beautiful under medium settings.

I am absolutely loving all the characters in the game and they are beautifully written and you will be smitten by a couple of them no doubt.However, i wish we could do more with them especially in regards to romances. It feels essentially like a virtual one night stand with any of the romanceable NPCs afterwhich CDPR thinks you'd just want to forget all about them and move on.
Its a damn shame because i'd love to do more activities with any of them(bowling,anyone?).

While there are plenty of side quests to be had, i just wish there were alot more unique ones available. I think it'd be fair to compare with TW3 since its the same devs. In TW3 you had plenty of smaller side quests with some backstory and almost every one of them is unique. In Night City, you'll find that the variety lacks and wanting.

The talent tree definitely needs some looking at. I mean you have a skill that allows you not to be detected underwater.Its useless because so far i've not had an encounter that revolves around a large body of water, or drain or sewage system. It goes to show that some parts of CP2077 is unfinished and very much needing some optimisation. 

As far as Vehicles are concerned, i hope CDPR will continue to work on them because i've been using a motorbike to cut across the city simply because driving a car is tedious and oftimes the controls are way to sensitive and/or it takes forever to make a U-Turn. A motorbike turning like a bus is not a good thing at all.However, i'm loving the vehicle designs and i hope they continue to make improvements on this.While i will not compare this game to GTA5, i still would like them to take a leaf or two our of Rockstars book in terms of vehicle driving. Like GTA 5, i'd like other drivers to behave accordingly when i crash into them. For example, i'd like them to get out of their vehicle if able and try to take me out etc.

NPC AI, well, dont expect anything revolutionary because the AI in this game ain't the sharpest tools in the shed. Its way too easy to lose cops and i wish my enemies would try to flank me or do something other than staying within my sights.


In conclusion, i am absolutely loving this game but CDPR has many many issues to fix. There is plenty of untapped potential in this game which i hope in the future will be fleshed out. I still would be recommending this game because while i acknowledge this game is far from perfect or revolutionary, its still a fantastic game and i have faith that CDPR will continue to develop NightCity.

1609862267,"Has it's problems, but still easily one of the best games I've ever played"
1609861924,"Everyone claiming this game is early access quality has obviously never played an early access game. Are there issues? Absolutely. Were our expectations not met? For sure. But the expectations were set more so by ourselves and the community than the developer. I'm not defending the downsides of the game. It's just not as bad as people let on. Its a solid game, with some problems I trust CDPR will at least try and manage."
1609861802,"Honestly the game has a lot of issues but over all its a lot of fun. Combat has issues, its imbalanced, it has /bugs, and the driving is really really bad. But the game as a whole is very fun, if you want a really good story with mostly fun combat this is your game, just make sure your comp can run it, not just minimum, you probably want a little better than recomended to play the game without issues"
1609861584,"das ist sehr gut, ja"
1609861432,"Played more the GOG version probably upt 50 more hours.

If you liked Witcher 3, this is probably the next best thing in a different setting. 

The game feels it needs more improvement but overall Its still a great experience especially the story. 

If bugs concern you best to check back in February"
1609861403,"Yes, it has bugs. It was released early. So for the people that want to know the simple question ""Is the game good"" well duh yes its amazing. It just has some bugs that couldn't be fixed because people with their panties in a wad demanded the game release be earlier."
1609861265,CDPR delivers as always
1609861228,bugs werent too bad and the Stor was entertainig. Would recommend
1609861217,Great game....highlight of 2020
1609861215,good game
1609861067,"Another example of why you should not preorder games. 
Not an RPG - story is straight as rails and multiple branches is very rare.
Not a GTA - there is nothing to do in the ""sandbox"", civilians react to you only when you straight up shooting them.
Not an IMMERSIVE SIM - the game will make you play only one way, if you go against it it will brake.
CyberUpgrades - imagine to rip out your bones to be 10% healfier.
Progression system - games concept of rpg is increasing stat numbers.

So much of promised content cut from the game that it looks like an implant harvesters victim.
AND OFCOURSE BUG BUG BUG OF ANY KIND.

IF YOU LIKE UNFINISHED BUGGY MESS BE WELCOME TO PAY MONEY FOR TESTING THIS BETA BULLSHIT"
1609860959,"Great RPG. Fun gameplay, an interesting story, and lots to do"
1609860827,"A masterpiece in the making. Obviously, we likely shouldn't have seen this title until Holiday 2021, but here we are — it's available so of course I've played it. It's easy to forget the CD Projekt Red is a young, indie studio. They may have bitten off more than they could chew, and it's hard to argue that the launch wasn't one of the most botched in history. But I believe that, by the time 2021 is over, we will have seen this labor of love come to full fruition.

PROS:
* Writing: CDPR clearly knows they're known for this, and they didn't disappoint. Like Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, there are great narratives to be found in side quests as well as in the main story. Not since Witcher 3's ""A Towerful of Mice"" quest had I been brought to a sobbing ruin. The themes of freedom, fate, identity, and wrath versus mercy, are executed masterfully. I'm very pleased to see that, despite the towering ambitions CDPR's devs had with this title, they did not allow the story to be second fiddle to any of its other aspects.
* Music: both the original score and the original, in-world music is just top-notch. The various radio stations of Night City all have their own aesthetic, and there are plenty of genuinely good tracks in there. Not since Horizon Zero Dawn have I found myself wanting to jam out on a soundtrack even when AFK.
* Visuals: having played this via Stadia as well as Geforce NOW pretty much from launch day, I can attest to the amazing look of this world. The retro-futuristic art style absolutely nails that aesthetic of how the works in this genre from the 1980s and 1990s envisioned their respective dystopian futures.
* Keanu Reeves: I have a hard time imagining how I would have ever connected with the uber-douche-y Johnny Silverhand, had I not been predisposed to really, really try, given his being played by the uber-likeable, Breathtaking Boyfriend of the Internet. By Act 3, I was getting lost in those dreamy eyes on the reg. And I loved the 40-ish take on Keanu's appearance — not the baby-faced kid from Point Break or Speed, but also not the well-seasoned, mid-50s version we have today in things like Bill and Ted 3 or the John Wick series. They picked the perfect, perennial version.

CONS:
* Customization is underwhelming — character customization is very basic. Fashion and utility are unfortunately bound together, making it a difficult trade-off when trying to give your character a certain look, while also trying to maintain your stats. Likewise things like grooming, tattoos, vehicle mods (functional and/or cosmetic), are all conspicuously absent.
* Immersion is interrupted and/or undermined. Consumables are usually only usable via the inventory UI, with absolutely no audio/visual representation of said consumption. You can pretty much count on 100% of female Black NPCs asking you ""Whats up in the big world?"". And It's a low-down, dirty shame that, given how enjoyable it is to just be riding in a vehicle as a passenger, taking in the world of Night City as it zooms by, that there's no train rides. Not saying that I don't want the Fast Travel feature pretty much as it currently exists, but if there were a ""scenic route"" travel option (i.e. travelling throughout the game world from point to point, but being able to experience the trip), I would definitely choose to travel that way a significant amount of the time. Like when the main quest finally brings you to Pacifica — definitely would have taken a train down there for my first trip.
* Police/NPC AI is unacceptable. If you can't have a sense of humor about this particular flaw, just go ahead and wait at least 9 months or so before playing this game. I do my best to avoid interacting with the placeholder mechanics for the cops and NPCs out and about in the world. Clearly, the devs didn't plan on the current functionality. Mark my words, though: this will improve.
* Keanu Reeves: I love the guy, of course. I'm not a monster! And as much as it sounds brilliant on paper, given his extensive history with the cyberpunk genre (Johnny Mnemonic, Constantine, The Matrix, John Wick, A Scanner Darkly), he just seems miscast. To have an A-list Hollywood actor in a game and have both his vocal and performance capture work be thoroughly upstaged by the rest of the cast... it's very unfortunate. After hearing reports of his attachment to the project many years into its development (i.e. definitely wasn't the original plan), I was immediately inclined to believe the reports because it makes so much sense. If they wanted to use a Hollywood actor for the role of Silverhand, it should have been someone like Nicholas Cage, Rami Malek, LaKeith Stanfield, Bradley Cooper, any of the Hemsworths, Russell Brand, Donald Glover, Pedro Pascal. Given the fact that apparently Mike Pondsmith drew his original inspiration for the character from David Bowie in Labyrinth, someone who can channel Bowie vibes could've been great. And that could be anything from Jemaine Clement to Tilda Swinton, to the serendipitously named Johnny Flynn, who played Bowie in the recent film Stardust (checked out the trailer and yeah, that would've definitely worked). A recent report of a supposed anonymous CDPR dev mentioned Cillian Murphy — again, I can see that as well."
1609860742,Works great on a high end PC. I know many have had technical issues on consoles and some computers but it working awesome for me so far. Gameplay is fun and packed with detail.
1609860708,"The game has a lot of bugs on this date, but i`m sure it will be fixed, like it was with Witcher. I like main (but the main story can be a little bit longer c: ) and substories. The atmosfere is great and Johnny ... he is reeeally breathtaken :D:"
1609860696,"Not in-depth review, just my opinion: I really enjoyed the story and game mechanics were very interesting. Did not suffer too many bugs or issues. Only 1 crash during 100+ hours of play. 

Side missions in this game are all meaningful and not just busy work. Overall recommended. 

"
1609862248,"A long awaited game, Cyberpunk 2077.

You may have, it is almost impossible not to, heard the news about this game being bugged or glitched to bits. You may have been led to believe opinions which are not yours, for it is better to form an opinion yourself. I find the game to be a combination of Watch Dogs, Sleeping Dogs and Perhaps a bit of Grand Theft Auto.

Honestly, the game has been over hyped, yes. Expectations were way to far fetched as for today's standards. And even beside that, it will already have heightened or upped the expectations for future games. The sheer amount of detail in this game in just absolutely insane. 
Normally, I am not the person to walk around in games, most aren't but this game; the amount of detail in the streets, everywhere you look is a little bit of life told; You look up and see the billboards, advertisements or just the cyberpunk styled buildings which are just breathtaking on their own. You may even find walkways up in the buildings, a hidden piece of detailed construction just for that one moment or just that one mission.
Looking down in the streets or the land around you may find the litter or every building to be almost unique looking. Having its own story and life. 

For the story, the writing is good, very good but it almost feels a bit too railed, see it as a metro going to its destination and you are its chauffeur. You may stop along the way for other people and other insights someone you may let in. (With this I mean other characters you may do side-quests for which may give a bit of insight into the game.) But all in all, you do still arrive at the destination where everyone eventually does; the credits. 
Obviously, the game can't go on forever, it may get some DLC one day which might be another story you can experience. Or it will be able to mod the game make some stories other players may experience on their own.

For me, I found the game to be a bit overwhelming at first, by that I mean that I wanted to take time to look at every little thing. But as I was looking at one thing, the next thing was already halfway into happening, I found this to be both good and bad at the same time: It made the game feel so alive but I also felt forced to continue in a way. 
And now for something which I did not like; the UI. Again, this was quite overwhelming  but in a negative way using the phone needed multiple menus, at first when trying to open your phone brings up a tablet looking menu where you have to scroll for your contact. In the case that you want to read or send a message to this contact you will be taken into the pause menu which in itself is also ""a bit too much''. 
That could have made a but more fluid, a bit more live. think of phone which is in Grand Theft Auto V. the world still revolves around you and you actually get the option to actually cancel a phone call...

All in all, I find the game to be very good, perhaps a bit bland in some aspects, but suppose that is what we get if we force a game. But even for a forced game; it will have set some expectations for future games from other game companies. 

Below here I will write the good and bad things for those who are interested in key points instead of some story.


=====================[Good]=====================  
- Absolute detail everywhere.
- The overall story.
- The graphics.
- Ways to play; Melee, Ranged or by hacking.
- Side quests.

=====================[Bad/Annoying]=====================  
- The UI and pause menu which have an abundance of things.
- Not being able to ignore or cancel phone calls.
- Non-critical choices in the game; You do get some but nothing along the way of choosing between two evils.
-  Shards: You find them everywhere and they have a lot of text which often doesn't matter much.
!- Worst of all; sneaking and skipping dialogue. (If I am sneaking around and suddenly a conversation starts; I normally don't want to be squatting. But I just end up skipping the dialogue because it is the same button.) 

=====================[Could be added]=====================  
- Being able to change button functions for controllers; keep pressing the wrong buttons for opening menus. Or keep skipping dialogue.
- Being able to sit everywhere; There are a lot of benches and whatever around. Would be nice if you could sit there.
- Eating animations. There are a lot of places to eat or order food, physically pressing a button on a machine or sitting down to eat (which is optional.) would be a nice detail.
- Vehicle customization; Speaks for itself.
- Leisure activities; such as smoking, brain-dances, cooking, bowling. It's the future, but without fun? Could do better there.
-  Archive Contacts, don't want to scroll through a big list of people to send on message.
- Optional 3D and 2D map; 3D map is a bit too much.
- Cutscenes where you actually get to see you character.
- Plastic Surgeons.
- Actually being able to use your chosen gender based genitalia. Perhaps even have it as a murder weapon, even if it is for just one mission...Or not...

Again, the game has heightened expectations for future games and companies. And for a forced game it is still good. even though it has been meme'd to the point where it is ""Fun"" to point out bugs.

I'd give the game as of 1/5/21 a score of 83/100."
1609860566,"I like it. It runs on my laptop perfectly. I have a rog zephyrus with a 1660 Ti max Q and ryzen 7. Everyone needs to calm down about this game. Mass Effect Andromeda is more broken than this game is. No mans sky launched with basically no working features. Calm down, its a good game, I am aware that there are still issues for some players (my best friend has a proper desk top and he can't get it to run). If you like long RPGs with tons of optional missions and story elements then this will be great. Tons of replay value. Just understand that even if its rough today with every patch its getting better and more stable."
1609860515,"after ignoring all the bugs and updating the driver, it's ok,"
1609860420,awesome
1609860182,"On the PC version I've encountered minor bugs that at worst have required a reload and have wasted maybe 15 minutes of my time. With that one complaint out of the way, the game is a masterpiece on par with anything that has come out on PC in the past 21 years (I'm specifically thinking of Deus Ex that came out back in 2000). Be advised that the story can be a bit grim, but it's a massive living breathing world filled with interesting characters and stories, and 'both' protagonists. The story feature about having an extra mind inside your mind was an excellent storytelling device."
1609860152,Great game. Love it on my computer.
1609860152,cyderpunk : )
1609860151,"is good,"
1609860099,Best RPG story I've played in a while
1609860078,"Despite the controversy I would overall recommend this game, if for no other reason than that I still do have faith that CDPR will turn this into a no-man's sky repeat.  I've been lucky and my only recurring bugs have been weird visual ones but they're less common now than they had been at launch.  I'd say that even if you don't get it at full price, grabbing it on sale whenever that happens is a very strong recommendation. right now I'd value the game at $45 US but personally I've certainly gotten far more than $60 of enjoyment from it."
1609859893,"Great story, linearish, but had a good time playing."
1609859599,"I have had no lagging and only a few minor glitches since I've began this game, so i have been pleasantly surprised. The story IMO is fantastic and there is so much to do. The replayability is high and only going to get better when more DLCs release."
1609859590,I really enjoyed this game. Got it at launch. Definitely some issues but I only had one game breaking bug where a car loaded in the wrong spot after a cut scene and I couldn't progress. There was an autosave at the start of the video so I only lost about two minutes of playtime and everything spawned correctly the second time. There are definitely some quality of life improvements that need to be made. The minimap needs to zoom out further when driving and you should be able to mass craft/destruct things. Imo this game is only going to get better with age. With futre DLC and fan mods this game is going to be something I play again 5-10 years in the future. Giving the game in it's current state an 8/10 and I'll update this in the future to let you know how I feel.
1609859550,Personally the only issues i have had so far is loading screens taking a while. I'd say its 4/5 stars. Definitely getting my moneys worth for a single player game. Definitely looking forward to any DLC.
1609859404,"There are minor bugs here and there for me, nothing game breaking. Wanted to get that out of the way first. Everything else is money, this game is so much fun!! Shooting, looting, and leveling up..all while in a cool open world to explore. The has been one of the best games and well worth the wait. I still have so much left to see and do and hasnt felt stale giving a very nice pacing throughout. This game wants a beefy system because the world is truly next-gen....dont be a turd and complain if your system cant handle it."
1609859397,"Runs just fine on my archaic i7 4770K /w GTX 780, did not experience any gamebreaking bugs and aside from the small glitches and questionable AI, the game is amazing!"
1609859313,"Recommended based on an assumption CPDR will fix the issues in the game even though we did not get what CPDR has promised/showcased. Here are some things that everyone must be aware of:

* Content was removed, probably to meet the release date
* Engine is NOT optimised. From insane hardware requirements (recommended specs are a joke) to stuttering to pop-ins to clip-ins
* AI is only artificial and no intelligence. Highly recommended to never interact with non mission characters
* Physics engine is broken. You will randomly slide, fall, get stuck
* Sound engine is broken. It will stop working at random areas. Imagine receiving a call and not being able to hear what the other person is saying and poof you have accepted a new mission 
* Higher difficulties don't improve AI or stuff. It just makes you a potato.
* Shooting it meh

Fortunately the game has not crashed a single time during my play-through. There were some game breaking bugs which were fixed by reloading the most current save."
1609859207,"Its breathtaking, you're breathtaking"
1609858874,"What can I say? Previously I had played 40 hours of Death Stranding (another amazing game) and thought ""wow, I put a lot of time into that."" Well this one just doubled it, and may triple it in the future. I loved this game. At this point, there's a glitch here and there. It's not perfection. But past those issues is an awesome world with deep characters, good stories, and some of the best gameplay I've experienced yet. Definitely in the top 3 games of all time for me. Thank you, CDPR, and I hope you guys can get past the negativity and maybe get some rest as well."
1609858726,"Not too buggy for me, kinda feels unfinished, still my game of the year choice."
1609858724,"Its still rough, but overall I cant stop playing. Good Game, poor optimization. Potential to be great."
1609858637,I look at it this way $1 worth of play per hour of game time. I am having fun on my pc game. Is it perfect no but is worth it? Yes. will it get better. I hope so and think it will.

1609858469,"At its current state, I would not recommend getting this game. As of 2 weeks after release, the bugs are still very common and immersion breaking. Although the game looks breathtaking, the awful pop-in and texture bugs just nullify it at times. Key, emotional points in the story are ruined because of these glitches too! Overall, if you want to get this game, please WAIT. The developers seem to have put many hours into this game, but after 3 cancellations, and promises of quality control and bug testing, this game is a buggy, unplayable mess!"
1609858447,"I'm having fun with the game. I just replaced my motherboard and processor. So I'm happy to be up after a 8-10 month of down time(dated and got married). There are glitches in this game, and per post CDPR execs cut content and other shannigans. Hopefully CDPR will fix the bugs and other issues. But I'm still enjoining it."
1609858354,"This game is incredible despite all the bugs (and there are tons), cut content and rough polish. I can't imagine what it would have been with another 6 months of polish. 

The story is great and the world is incredibly immersive. Combat is very robust. Unlike many others, I don't mind the driving mechanics - I actually think they're decent.

If you can wait for CDPR's promised patches, then wait. If you can't, that's fine too and you'll still enjoy the hell out of it. 

I can't wait for a 2nd playthrough once the game is patched up."
1609858320,i have 180 hours played beat the game in every way possible and to be honest at first i thought it was a great game but really its just the same exact thing 3 times and then thats it there nothing fun to do its just the same missions over and over again  gta 5 u can atleast play it after words but this it just ends nothing to do in game other then same missions uninstalled
1609858117,"This game surely has it's issues, the physics engine is out of this world.. I mean literally, how can the body I drop just fly across the area !! . Stealth was almost impossible because of this, none the less, the game portrayed a great story and changes in main story that directly depends on which missions we wanted to complete. Overall it was a great experience, as I was playing on PC I didn't notice any huge graphical flaw nor crashes. I would play it one more time maybe after all the main fixes and the free DLC :)"
1609858111,great game with TONS of side quests. People are saying there are a lot of bugs and glitches but I have yet to see them (roughly 15 hours of gameplay so far).
1609858072,"After 20 hours of running around and doing missions:
Fun: yes
Bugs: yes, do not turn game unplayable though, remaining optimistic about updates
Story: excellent
Combat: easy, intuitive
Driving: First Person is a bit too sensitive, 3rd Person quite good, crash mechanics need improvement though
- Radio music: would give it an 8/10
"
1609857946,"Good for an alpha test but as a £60 game? No. 
A very unique RPG with initially ""meh"" gunplay and amazing upgrades with many unique play styles. I've mainly been doing side missions which have a lot of charm and are very interesting with decent rewards. One early side mission had me talking a rogue AI car out of driving off a bridge and I couldn't stop laughing, you can definitely see that the devs loved this game which they were forced to put out early. I haven't played enough to review the main story but so far it is pretty linear and filled with lore buzzwords which I personally don't like.
The bugs are a major downside to the experience as even visual errors really break the immersion during some scenes, my game had major frame drops during what was supposed to be a sad scene which totally ruined the experience. Ive also had game breaking bugs which prevented me from moving which are unacceptable. I also had to essentially optimise the game myself with an online guide to change around settings even in windows settings. I have a mid range card and processor which made me think it was just my PC letting me down but after tinkering I hit 60-140 FPS, it really rekindled my interest to play.

I wouldn't recommend buying this now but allegedly March will have a big update that would essentially be the finished game. If you don't mind a few bugs and love RPGs I would recommend but accept it as an alpha forced onto us by the higher ups a CDPR. I'm thinking of replaying the game in its final state as this game has a ton of replay value with builds."
1609857750,"In spite of its many shortcomings, the world design and the city is just too amazing to miss. And also, terrific soundtrack."
1609857693,its good fun
1609857582,.
1609857577,The prologue around 8 hours and the ending around 8 hours too. In completionist run about 125 hours of gameplay without any dlcs. For me it is mix of Deus ex Saints row and Withcher. Game has few bugs some of them are game breaking and some of them are quite funny Similar to skyrim. Well it is solid 9/10 if they will release moding kit or modders will take wheel i would say this game will age gold. Like skyrim.
1609857547,Worth the price tho
1609857442,Loved the main story and the secondary quests that focus on V's friends.
1609857188,"Disappointed.
"
1609857050,"Best RPG ive played since the Witcher 3.  People like to complain about bugs and the world not being ""immersive"" enough - those people are sad, pathetic individuals.  

Missions are fun.  Funny situations and dialogue.  Combat is fun - AI is admittedly bad though (like Goldeneye bad).  Crafting is about as fun as it can be - you can deconstruct any item to build new ones.

I did every single side quest available at launch and beat the game with the ""secret"" ending in 92 hours.  Pretty good for any single player game.  RDR2 hasn't kept my attention for even 30 hours.

 If you like doing boring - waste of time - game mechanics like hunting, mercantile skill, drawer opening animations or horse play then maybe look for something else to spend $60 on.

If you like having fun then play this game. 
"
1609856997,Forget the hype or any preconceived ideas and just treat it as any new game. The graphics are outstanding and some of the missions are great for me far too many boring ones. I doubt this games target audience is 70 year olds.
1609856859,I am loving it!
1609856817,"This game is borderline- No, just straight unplayable.

Minus the performance required to play this game (which is through the stratosphere at this point) the game is glitchy as fuck. From my experience, it reaches a climax of glitchyness right after the extraction of ""The Chip."" My car floats high in the sky, my gun 20 feet ahead of me and somebody instakilling me or flinging me within milliseconds of spawning. Hell, the cops spawn on me sometimes when I spawn in.

The game is amazing in terms of open-world capability, but this creates a disillude that I haven't seen in any other game and it arguably ruins the game in some capacity. When you encounter a story mission, it feels too forced for such a game like this. ""Forced"" is the best way to put this, there is nothing else I could do in my words to elaborate it.

This game's story is something I love but it ruins the whole theme of Cyberpunk 2020. A piece of anti-capitalist literature turned into a neon-retro nightmare.

Don't get me wrong, the game is good, the story is great especially with Keanu Reeve's performance. But its a glitch-filled mess, don't come expecting a easy time driving a car or progressing, go easy mode on this game for as long it is in this state, it already feels like a nightmare."
1609856605,"This game can run a bit sloppy at times, but so can a delicious lasagna. This game's story is fantastic, especially if you never watched any of the trailers before playing. I had the extreme privilege to play without watching any trailers, as I wasn't initially interested in cyberpunk. When a news article came out about the game's release on Dec. 7, I decided to make an impulse purchase. Boy, was I not disappointed. This game has some of the most fantastic characters, story lines, and random encounters I've ever experienced second, in my opinion, to Fallout: New Vegas, which I grew up with. However, the only area I believe this game outshines my love for New Vegas is in the voice acting. The sheer dedication the team put into making each line feel like it was coming from a real human, instead of an actor playing a character in a video game, is phenomenal. 10/10 Lasagnas"
1609856567,"Steam won't let me refund this incomplete game.
11/10"
1609856378,"Great game, needs a few quality of life improvements. This ain't an RPG but glorified FPS. 

8/10"
1609856347,Idk.. the bugs and shit is a thing but the narrative is so strong. Side missions are as interesting as the main story arch. I'm 60 hrs in and I havent even explored everything.
1609856164,"Bugs may occur at times, it is obviously far from finished, but as you play on you can see the effort put into this game, how like there is a lot and LOTS of shards (Messages in the game) about random stories here and there, and I believe that the story line is amazing, I love it, even with the bugs"
1609855940,"Well well well. I cant get a refund becuase i spent over 12 hours ""in game"" trying to optimize and test the settings and im not able to get it smooth. so yeah waste of money . i wouldnt buy it if i knew"
1609855857,"Okay.. 99 hours for this game. I know it is much for somebody maybe but i have do this, i have to play this game till it make me crazy.

I will make my comments for this ""ACTION GAME"". Not the one promised as ""RPG"".

It was hard to decide to give this game a recommend or not. But as you see i decided to give it a ""No"". I am sorry CDPR but it is not seems as a game developed for 8 years. 

First of all i want to talk about pros.

[h1] PROS [/h1]

Great ambiance at every enviroment
Great sound effects as street sounds, indoor sounds
Great lightning without ray tracing
Cool AI modelling
While you are playing, you feel like you are really at there and that lady who is eating something is really eating at that stool

Is that all? Yes, unfortunately it is.

[h1] CONS [/h1]
[i]Where do i have to start? [/i]

BUGS?!?!? There are tons of bugs... While you are in cutscene.. When you call your car.. Even if you are trying to scan, there are some moments ""oh my god how/why???"".. While you are walking.. TONS OF BUGS..
If you want to play this game, just wait for another 1 year then play. How a bug can happen when you try to pick up loot from a body. Yes it is true. You oftenly can not pick item from a or a surface. Yes it is true, you suddenly die without any acknowledge. Yes it is true, your car spawn under another car and when you try to get it it explodes, etc. etc. i can write more but i dont want to...

Game force you to spend evenly your skill points to body or tech for open some doors. But here is the news!! You can enter room with another way as like broke a window or climb to the roof! Why do i have to spend points to body or tech? Oh you can not say i am smart then... Hmm or you can not bully someone. Is that really it? The conversation you will make with somebody (with your skills) will eventually connect to the same conclusion. Your skills wont change the conclusion even if you bully someone, yes..

""Stealth is an option for this mission"" is a lie. YOU CAN NOT DO STEALTH SOME OF THE MISSIONS. Oh there are some turrets, lets close'em. Great! Oh cameras, close'em, okay we are doing great for now! What?? What is happening?? How they noticed me? Oh i see... They can see through walls.. LIKE WHAT? :D Okay let's do it again, close turrets, close cameras, then again now they noticed me while they are not even looking me :D Some of missions was like that, and some of missions was like ""okay there is no way i can enter there stealthly"" because it is...

Then suddenly, even if you have double jump speciality, you simply can not double jump. Because fuck you thats why :D. You have to restart game for this. 

Then suddenly, even if you have weapons on quickslots, you simply can not use a weapon, even you can not hit anyone with your fists. Because fuck you thats why :D. You have to restart game for this. 

Johnny's records... You can not pick up like %80 percent of those records. Don't bother about it yourself.

After i finished every side quests + NCPD quests there is nothing left to do. You can go and grab something to eat, you can drive a car and you can fuck a hooker, you can buy some weapons and you can buy some clothes. Thats the end of the game. Yes those are not enough for me, maybe those are enough for you.

In conclusion, you can play this game for action but don't hurry much. Just wait for a couple years then play it after CDPR corrected some of those bugs."
1609855573,"Поспешишь - людей насмешишь. Эту фразу походу CDPR знать не знали и даже не хотели знать.

Можно долго описывать проблемы с которыми столкнулись как и игроки PC MASTER RACE, так и в большей степени консоле холопы. Но честно, как бы мне не хотелось смешать с коричневой смесью эту игру, я не позволю себе этого сделать.

Очень долго можно расписывать плюсы, минусы, вырезанный контент (пишу на момент января 2021 года. Может уже многое и вернули обратно в игру), но честно, после прохождения истории - не хочется совершенно. Лично для меня это эпохальная игра десятилетия, которая навсегда врезалась в мою память, да и миллионов других геймеров. И уж поверьте, эта игра ещё сделает свой камбек. 

С учетом всех проблем я ставлю заслуженные 9/10. Все таки полную десятку игра не заслужила ни по каким параметрам. Когда в графе минусов, их число будет приближаться к единицам, а количество плюсов взлетят в потолок (хотя их уже там довольно много), тогда и будет преславутые 10/10 и 11/10. 

п.с. А так, не слушайте никого. Поиграйте сами и составьте своё мнение."
1609855540,"Brilliant game just finished my first run of the game with a few minor bugs hear and there but nothing to put me off playing. now i'll let it cook for another year and have another run when CDPR patch the shiz out of it and hopefully it will feel like a new game, win win in my eyes."
1609855519,"If you can see past the same type of bugs every other open world game has and aren't trying to run the game on 3+ gen old hardware, it's a decent game. The narrative is top-notch, but it's held back by sloppy combat mechanics, awful driving, and lots of bugs/glitches. Ideally I'd suggest waiting until late Q1/early Q2 2021 when CDPR will hopefully have the game patched into a more stable state, but even then, it's still going to have the issues of being a generally poorly balanced gameplay experience. I kinda wish CDPR had made the narrative into a graphic novel or a Netflix series or something rather than putting it in this tired example of everything that bigger developers have been doing wrong for the past 15 years."
1609855313,"Colorful, detailed, aesthetic but dead."
1609855448,"Save your money, just buy it on sale. It doesn't worth for current state of the game.

Weapon - with all the weapon I owned, the only customization on weapon I can made is the sight and silencer.

Vehicle - You can purchase a vehicle, but damn it all second hand. And no customization for the vehicle. :(

Braindance - You have the braindance tool but you can't play it :(

V - from the start I was a poor Mercenary, stay at H10 Apartment. After max out street cred and selling paints for living, I still live in H10 apartment. :) [spoiler]Hey, I can create a female character with a dick but I cannot make use of it. wtf? :)[/spoiler]

World - All the street food can't be tasted, Clothing Shop can't try on clothing, No NPC riding bikes [spoiler] Well...NPC suck in 4 wheel, so 2 wheel... :) [/spoiler]

Driving - The driving are weird in game, it felt like you are driving a soap.

Cyberware - My Mantis Blades can't climb walls, My Gorilla arms can't force open doors, My Monowire can't do hacking.

Afterlife - There are many drink inside the bar, but they don't have a drink named after my brother.
[spoiler] Vodka on the rocks, lime juice, ginger beer and a splash of love. -- A Jackie Welles [/spoiler]

Story - The main story is quite short, i think some side quest is better than main story. Maybe just me doesn't satisfied the main story, well it depend from person to person.

Will update if the game is add more features [spoiler]AKA features that has promised before release :)[/spoiler]"
1609854887,Great game!
1609854657,"under the buggyness, it's a great experience."
1609854583,"Even with all these bugs this is definitely the best game ever. The ending was very emotional, touching, and the perfect way to end off the game. 10 out of 10
"
1609854573,"Picture this:

Your favorite dish is Lasagna. One day, your Mom comes up to you and says ""I'm gonna make you a good Lasagna in two months from now"".  Obviously, as the lasagna lover you are, you get pretty excited as You know that your Mom has made quite a few Lasagnas in the past, and they were mostly pretty good! Mom goes on saying ""I know what worked in the past, and I've learned from my mistakes, so this Lasagna will surely be the best one I can possibly make!""... You start getting yourself excited.

For a few weeks, your Mom doesn't say a word, until finally, she starts teasing you again. She tells you about this new ground beef she found that just tastes so delicious when done right. She describes the new kind of cheese she found, that she knows you'll love. Not only that, but she tells you about the recipe, shows you some photos off of Google pictures. Your excitement couldn't get higher. 

Two weeks before the supposed feasting day, Your mom says ""Actually, I'm gonna need some more time, so that the Lasagna really is perfects and satisfies you fully."" You, slightly disappointed, understand that decision and allow it. Then it happens again and again, and you think to yourself ""Whatever, I've waited long enough, at least there is a delicious meal at the end of the journey""… Of course, due to all these delays you get somewhat suspicious and start questioning your mom's capabilities but at the end of the day, you know she's made real good lasagnas before, so you stay calm and maybe suspect it to be a bit unfinished, nothing that a few more minutes in the oven wouldn't fix. Your mom keeps hyping you up.

The day finally comes, and you sit at the table, excited as ever. Mom appears from the kitchen and brings you a Pizza.

You start eating because you're so god damn hungry, and get a little confused after a few bites… ""This isn't the lasagna you've promised"" you say. Your mom just stares at you with a smile. You're confused. Disappointed. But you keep eating the god damn Pizza because you're so hungry and in fact, you love a good Pizza! And this Pizza isn't too bad either, maybe it's missing a couple of your favorite toppings and the crust is a bit too crunchy, but you still devour it. You don't even mind that you had Pizza a couple of times at your grandmas place a few weeks ago. Again, you really like Pizza and this one is good enough… But in the end… Its still not the Lasagna you really wanted and your mom promised you…

Cyberpunk 2077 is the Pizza. A Pizza that I can not recommend at the moment due to the glaring issues, glitches and bugs that are all very much so present. I may come back to this review a few months down the line again, and see if it is a game worth recommending. I personally enjoyed my time, and if you know what you're signing up for, you can have a good time, just as I did. But if you're expecting a good, deep RPG as promised with maybe a couple of glitches here and there, you will be disapointed. If you go in expecting Fallout 4.5, in a breathtaking city with a very thick atmosphere and enjoy the grindy nature of a game like this, then it may satisfy your needs.

Final verdict: Pizza/10"
1609854549,"Love this game, the city is huge, the main missions and major side missions are very memorable, the dialogue with Keanu is supreme.  Graphics are great and run well on my 2060, love DLSS.  Majority of issues you heard about in the dramatic launch have been fixed. Highly recommend to people with good rigs. This is really a next gen game."
1609854533,"After nearly 70 hours spent in the game, I feel I can finally give my verdict.

[i]It's okay.[/i]

Here's why:

1. The main story is short for an RPG. You end up at the point of no return faster than you'd expect and it is a bit of a let-down.
2. Character development is rather underwhelming. I found myself very reactionless at certain points even though it is clear it was going for some sort of emotional trigger. You can't expect for us to find some sort of reaction when you can only interact with them through 4-5 missions.
3. There's a lot of content that doesn't impact the game. It keeps you busy for hours digging through a trash pile outside in Badlands, but it doesn't have much of impact on you in the end story wise. I found it time consuming and okay, but it wasn't as rewarding.
4. Crafting could be improved. 
5. Yet, in the end, the city itself is a good place to be. It has great design, interesting bits to find and stare at and consumes quite a lot of your time.

It's a good cyberpunk game. It's missing things there and here that can be improved over time. There's a lot of places to expand and improve, change and develop. For now, it's a fine game, maybe in future it can be a great game. 

I wasn't expecting much but found myself spending a lot more time there than intended.

"
1609854525,This game gives me the chills! Absolutely beautiful!
1609854372,"it`s such an immersive game, sure there`s some bugs and missing features but what is there already is GREAT!"
1609854372,"Ignore the hypetrain and the salt. On its own merits, this is an immensely fun title that will give you 100+ hours of action. Story is fantastic, and if you're willing to look past a few bugs (which'll get patched out or modded out anyway - they are already) this is a title I'd highly recommend. 

Awesome gunplay, hacking is great, RPG elements are sound, and the city is one of the most atmospheric settings in gaming history."
1609854034,"Honestly cannot get enough of this game...

Best game I have ever played, without a doubt."
1609854005,"Great game with a very high replay value. You can do so many things in Night City.

Gameplay-wise its fun and even challenging at times. If you love Open-World Exploring with a good Storyline and interesting sidequests/side storylines, then this game is definitely for you.

It has minor annoying bugs that will occasionally reset your progess by 10-20 minutes (because you have to reload an older save, which fixes most bugs), but they're not so common. 
Most bugs are just weird/funny and dont hinder your progess whatsoever.

You need a decent PC to run it with tho. But other then that, this game is very nice."
1609853668,holy moly
1609853566,"great story, alrite gunplay, cool but limited upgrades, bad driving, great world design, Keanu Reeves, glitches galore."
1609853547,"game is buggy for now, but it doesnt seem to stop me from enjoying the game. it is kinda short even with the side missions and what not. the story is great. the combat is really intuitive. advanced skills, perks, upgrade trees. graphics are amazing. overall cyberpunk 2077 is really good and after cdpr patches her up the game is gonna be god-like"
1609853513,really2 worth for buy.. very2 awesome
1609853169,"Отвал башки, 1488/10.
Теперь и у меня есть повод носить цдпр на руках и молиться на них :D"
1609853044,Judy Alvarez
1609852965,"I love the game but was disappointed in the end of the main  story line, rather depressing, and despite all the glitches it was still fun"
1609893647,"I had high hopes when this was first announced but the more I waited, the more the excitement subsided. Gameplay footage a month before the game was released gave me the impression not to expect much and I haven't been wrong. I just couldn't resist buying it a day after release any way, just on the off chance I was wrong.

Some of the controls are silly/unresponsive/slow and the stealth function is pretty pointless as it somehow always turns into a shootout for me despite being overly cautious (I've completed Deus Ex Mankind Divided without tripping any alarms lol).

The subpar graphics (I can run on medium with a GTX 970) have textures popping in and out with even vehicles disappearing but physically still there. Glitches/bugs are rampant (unable to pick up items) and I'm stuck with having subtitles come up from Silverhand saying a line from a distant completed mission every time I load into the game.

Overall, underwhelming ""futuristic"" Grand Theft Auto. Maybe it'll get better but I doubt it."
1609852399,"Immersive city! Got quite some minor bugs on release. Hoping some features and patch will be add later, just like Witcher 3! But again I'm very impressed by the look of the city, very immersive."
1609852198,Warcrimes are enabled
1609851781,"Despite the issues with bugs and glitches, I adore this game. The story is great and the side quests often surprised me with how detailed they were. When I could slip into a side quest and it felt like it was a main quest of its own with a few branching secondary quests, thats when I fall in love with a world's lore. The fact that Pondsmith does voice over for a radio station also makes me feel as if the Game master of this vast campaign is letting us in on the deeper sectrets of the world as he starts arranging the next part of the story. Its the small details like that that really make this one of my new favorite games. The game has tons of issues, from grindy crafting that takes too long to buggy vehicle physics that pull me out of this wonderfully immersive world. those are what some will feel like great let downs in this gem of a game. Those issues make this a diamond in the rough until CDPR fixes and improves those glaring problems."
1609851773,"Enjoying the game very much, despite all the Bugs. The fact that it has high hardware requirements was well know before, so nothing to complain about."
1609851698,Still waiting for Penis 2 to come out
1609851682,breath taking story
1609851652,"While the main story and side missions are great, the latter are, at least at the beginning, hidden between all the ""useless"" side gigs.

You will probably get between 30 to 100 hours out of the game, depending on whether or not you try to complete all the random side gigs, which generally are ""go to place and steal/rescue/kill everyone"" type missions. 

The game has a bunch of bugs, luckily nothing game breaking happened to me. However, some user experience decisions I can not understand.

You may only craft one item at a time, which is fine for equipment, but healing items, material upgrades and ammo? I don't know how much time I've wasted by holding down LMB, waiting to finish the craft, and hold down LMB again, because of course you need more than one magazine of ammo.

Generally there are no confirmations before you buy a vehicle or fast travel, which is annoying if you misclick a fast travel point while scrolling the map, or try to get in a random car which happens to be one of the cars you may buy - this will immediately buy it and you either have to reload, or deal with the loss of money.


While CDPR has made the overworld look densely populated, they achieved this by pretty much removing pedestrian/vehicle AI, culling objects as soon as they are out of sight, and using 2D car models when you're a bit farther away. 
There isn't anything to do in the overworld if it is not a shop or mission related - yes, there's the one random side mission [spoilter]with the guy that froze his crotch[/spoiler], but I've not had any other random encounters. No easter eggs, no mini games, no secrets to be found by exploring NC means that when you are done with the missions and gigs, you will have no reason to play this game again, except to replay the story.

The wanted system is a joke. Cops spawn near you, even in inaccessible areas, sometimes even in front of your driving car. But not to worry, as you can lose them by moving away two blocks, even on higher wanted levels.

Despite all this, as I've said in the beginning, I enjoyed most of the quests, but the game lacks polish and the world feels empty, despite being filled with a ton of vehicles and NPCs, as they might as well not be there from a gameplay perspective.

I would still recommend this game, I personally had fun and would argue that at approximately 60 hours to complete (most, I think) side missions and the main story line, puts this at 1€ per hour, which is a decent return on investment. 

Compared to something like Kingdom Come:Deliverance, which had a starting price of 40€ and was made by a much smaller development team, CP2077 is a disappointment."
1609851318,"A solid RPG, undone by all the hype built up over the years and a rocky launch.

It is shameful how the gaming media has been trying to sabotage the game, though. Ubisoft and Bethesda have been releasing games that are buggy messes on launch for decades to raving reviews."
1609851304,its good but be wary of bugs
1609851181,"It's good I guess. :)

+ Good Story
+ Diverse Characters
+ Amazing Graphics (if you have a high end PC)

- Glitchy
- Buggy
- Demanding on Hardware

Verdict: Recommended but wait for additional patch/es to be rolled out."
1609851038,"I haven't had the stability issues others complain about, albeit I am running a pretty high-end rig (i9 and RTX 2080 Super). The storyline is fantastic and the world is as immersive as Witcher 3, in my opinion. I'm excited to see future improvements, but I'm happy with the product as it was released as well."
1609851021,"Played about 100 hours (mod I installed made steam not know the game was running hence my 30 hours played time on steam) and 100 percented  the game. Hella of a way to spend $60, and I can't wait to replay it in a year when everything has been patched, the DLCs are out, and the modding community has had its way with it."
1609850700,"In its current state it is rather buggy but, in my opinion makes it more memorable great gameplay romance options are few which is dissapointing"
1609850638,"I've mostly ignored all the conversation and hype leading to and following the release of this game.

I find it to be a perfectly adequate game with an enjoyable and solid experience in its main and side quests.

The game has plenty of missing or broken aspects (photo mode, character or vehicle customisation, NPC/driving/police AI... perhaps too many), I'll give you that. But all in all, it's a game that me and my friends are thoroughly enjoying after dozens of hours in it.

Night City on its own is my highlight of the game, it truly shines and it's a pleasure to get lost in it.

I trust CDPR will, in first place, do the right thing to address the issues reported by the community, and that the community itself leaves the current attitude behind so the game can evolve to be the game everybody wanted, including the devs themselves."
1609850525,"CDPR ""It'll come out when it's ready""
CyberPunk released
G.R ""IT'S RAW""
Вырезанного контента так много что на 70 часу начали кровоточить глаза."
1609850490,Despite all the bugs and nonexistent AI this really is a masterpiece. I have never been so immersed in game world as in CP77. Can´t wait for a moment the game will be completely fixed.
1609850477,"Yeah it's fairly clear that the devs needed more time to optimise and clean up the bugs, and likely more content they wanted to add, but what's here still manages to be one of the best games of recent years. A great story, brilliant dialogue and characters, as well as pretty fun (but somewhat clunky admittedly) gameplay really makes this shine."
1609850296,"Yes, there are indeed bugs, but no more than you would expect in a well polished Beta. Given the gameplay and the all the functionality that DOES exist, I'm more than happy with the current state. The love for their product that the Devs have is very evident, and if there was a way to fire the 'people' who told them to push the game out, without harming the devs, I would be all over it."
1609850222,"Yes... The game is buggy. Yes... I'm still waiting for updates to solve issues not allowing me to finish a side quest. But all of that doesn't take a away from a great game that has fully immersed me into what I always felt a near future cyberpunk setting would look like. The city is amazing to see an explore (The wastelands… not so much) and there truly are side quests and gigs to engage with for a long time. I fully recommend, and even more so as new patches come out and solve the pending issues with the game."
1609850123,"despite bugs, still very enjoyable
"
1609850013,"Despite the issues with this game I feel very good about this title. CDPR is gonna fix it, im not worried."
1609849696,This game is amazing!  The graphics are fantastic and the story is great.   Highly recommended!
1609849542,buggy but good
1609849369,"Ok let me just say this, im about 30-40% done the storyline. and i havnt seen many glitches let alone any game braking ones. i've only seen floating doors and a pistol with about 10K health that i had to kill in order to progress.

on the other hand it has a good story, 10/10 would recommend it"
1609849266,love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1609849135,"A masterpiece of narrative amidst a sea of bugs. Still a very good game and definitely worth it, regardless of the controversies surrounding it."
1609849070,Gud Game
1609852694,"[b]Firstly wish i could have the neutral/mixed recommendation option for anyone who reads this review. Nevertheless bellow are reviews from my own perspective.[/b]


[b]Story[/b]: okay. many plot holes esp for Jackie it needs more depth. The life path you choose (corpo/nomad/street kid) basically narrows down to one V after you are done past the prologue not as advertised. 3.5/5.

[b]Game Feature[/b]: Marketing team are way deep onto the dangerous territory. Basically the feature missing is outstanding from their marketing materials even the existing UI and features are unpolished or feels way downgraded compared to their demo preview the massive loss is on the customisation character UI, enemy information bar, buying another apartment/property, a stable way to generate income besides killing/pacify enemies, third-person option camera on foot, hacking mechanics, interactive world details, vehicle manoeuvrability, NPC AI, and many more. Then this is the worst feature available from the game Police+Wanted system; police may just ""teleport"" in front of you and sometimes if you get the bug while killing enemies you could get one star in 3 seconds they just show up regardless of you inside or the building the problem is they just one shot you and ruining the mission. The features are way oversell; borderline false advertisement even they said work in progress [b]1/5[/b].

[b]Graphics[/b]: This is where the game able to shine, ray traced feature simply makes the world looks marvellous, although even on the quiet place with barely any NPC walking still experience noticeable drop and might experience glitching at some in game hour. needs major optimisation [b]4/5[/b].

[b]Stability[/b]: some quest could not complete/soft locked until you redo the quest or it just stop working, citizen AI might suddenly stop working and be frozen in place while walking or driving, game could crash if you try other running program such web browser, music/sound bugs, NPC air walk above ground or all NPC within kilometres suddenly runs in fear while we just walking around, jumps and u fall under the ground  indefinitely or teleport to another place, FPS issue and many more. it's still a bug observatory, 1.05 patches still haven't been seen helping much either [b]1.5/5[/b]



Overall my self enjoy the way the world looks (graphics) while the experience might be tolerable or not for some of you if you factor in the world interaction in it; i suggest if you have some buddies or relatives that have the copy you may try it your self before buying it. Cheers."
1609848971,Pretty good
1609848864,"I know many are complaining about how buggy the game is. And I did encounter a few bugs. However none of the bugs are of the crippling type. The majority were little graphical issues that did not impact the gameplay. No bugs prevented me from completing every side gig as well as the main story. And what a story!
"
1609848852,"released as an incomplete,overhyped mess"
1609848687,This game is absolutely Crack Cocaine
1609848400,"The whole game is better than its parts.
Inconvenient driving (GTA or Saint's Row The Third are better), mediocre stealth (Deus Ex HR/MM and Dishonored 1/2 are better), shooting here is like in Fallout 3/The Outer Worlds, AI is somewhat unconvincing or even stupid, etc., etc.
On the other hands there's big and beautiful Night City, interesting characters (Jackie, Panam, Claire, Johnny and others) with their story arcs, atmosphere in general, netrunning/hacking skills and other things.
And when it all comes together it becomes a buggy, undercooked but still good game that I'd recommend at least to try play."
1609848388,"It's not perfect, but it's a great game. I wouldn't call it revolutionary, but it's a lot of fun in a stunning setting. I almost never replay this type of game, but I will replay this one.

As of 1.06 on PC, the bugs are not game-breaking, though still frustrating at times."
1609848363,not even worth pirating
1609848287,"It has some bugs, also some glitches and sometimes the UI is not working fine. But, besides that, I'm really enjoying this game."
1609848032,"CDPR really has outdone themselves. I originally bought the game one the xbox one S and beat the game playing the corpo role and even through the MINOR bugs in the game i really enjoyed the game. i decided to see if my laptop could run the game and it turned out i can run it on max everything. I recommend this game to anyone who wants a deep story with fun and exciting driving, combat, dialog and much more. GREAT JOB to everyone at CDPR and i for one cant wait for you're upcoming DLC and future projects.

Anyway gotta delta back to NC. fox92"
1609847967,Found myself running around like a mad man eating all the food and drinking booze making bad decisions for undesirable outcomes relying heavily on LOAD GAME time travel.
1609847963,"I really liked Cyberpunk. Great atmosphere and storytelling throughout the mainstory, the world and side gigs made for a very complete and overwhelming experience. The combat was very diverse and you can come up with a nice variation of builds like a netrunner that just makes heads explode and goes undetected behind enemy lines or just a gun ho Rambo that destroys anything in its path or an insanely fast slowmo using katana wielder that serves up enemies like a cybernetic blender. Only downside is in the end the game gets slightly too easy and could use some work there and sadly there is no new game+ or any endgame content. I enjoyed every single hour ive put in it and still crave for more."
1609847243,"If you will don´t count the bugs this game is awesome. Beatiful world, fascinating story, good game play, very well written characters. And in this state of game when there were some patches and updates this game don´t have that much bugs at all. for me personally 10/10
"
1609847215,"It's fine, needs work wait before you buy."
1609847092,yes i like it and yes its buggy. thats all i have to say.
1609847045,"Averaging about 30-60 hours per playthrough depending on how many quests you do, great value. Highly detailed open world with amazing graphics, good replayability, bugs aren't game breaking most of the time and worth it with the free DLC coming,"
1609846912,fun
1609846906,"Despite the bugs, glitches and cut content, I still had a lot of fun in the game, I really got attached to the characters in this game. I truly hope in a year this game will get the praise it deserves, and hopefully this game will succeed even more with time. I enjoyed every moment in this game, and I expect a lot more from it. 

For everyone who probably want a full immersive journey in this game, I would suggest waiting 6 months to year, because probably until then, the game will be fixed, with new content coming too."
1609846711,Great game!
1609846596,"This game could've been something remarkable but it wasn't ready to come out so soon. That said, I still really enjoyed it and would recommend it in a few patches or if you have a beefy pc. During my playtime I've had minimal bugs that annoyed me, mileage may vary for you. Game story is short and feels like a lot of content was cut to be short and meet deadlines, skips and interesting ideas and/or paths not explored for no apparent reason."
1609846304,Never got past the title screen. 10/10 would watch title screen again.
1609846255,"like it, great story-telling and very related sometimes..."
1609845999,do you cum?
1609845626,"Can't wait for it to be fully fixed, some models/textures are slow to loads, mainly characters/cars, and some dialogue the NPCs lips doesn't move, but all in all, very enjoyable, nothing game breaking has happened thus far."
1609845476,"Very fun early acces game, cant wait for the devs to finish it!"
1609845288,great game just dont play on console
1609844550,"Is the game fun? Yes. Is it buggy at times? Yes. Is it worth the money? Yes, all day. Get the game."
1609844547,"Good
"
1609844435,"I can't recommend this game in it's current state, It's up to CDPR to fix this mess."
1609844406,SHIT AGTME OG MY GOFCUK ING HATE IT
1609844397,"Graphics 10/10
Story 7/10
AI 1/10
Bugs 7/10 (if you find bugs, usually...save and than reload, it works)
HW needed to play (not yet invented / area 51)
UI 5/10
Crafting system 3/10

10 means no issues / best
1 means bottom of the hole, worst.

Hope CDPR will improve AI and optimization for this game....I mean....I play it on a RTX 3080 :). The most annoying thing is the low level ""AI"" in this game, repeating people on the streets, same patterns, ugly textures for cars on  the road, as you view them in distance, Also crafting system is.......gezus, bleaks! that`s not a crafting system...is a total mess up. They should have added blueprints in game and make missions regarding them.

I recommend it, but still......is in same category as No Mans Sky, maybe a bit better."
1609844383,only come across very little bugs and glitches but over all love the game
1609844357,"Overall the game was a solid experience, their were some bugs but overall it was a great. 
Probably should wait a couple months before buying it so the bugs get ironed out and game becomes more optimised (will probably be on sale by then as well).

8/10"
1609843983,"Is it big? Yes.
Is it ambitious? Indeed.
Is it buggy? Absolutely.

But, at the end of the day, this game is very much enjoyable once you can get your head around everything. I suggest giving this game a go when you get the chance, but perhaps wait until the price tag is lower before you buy it yourself."
1609843848,pet cat
1609843532,"The reason why I give this game a negative score is that they lied about the state of the game.I really enjoy the game so far, but it could have been better if the game was polished and extra content added that was cut.I would wait another year for Cyberpunk to release or went early access like Baldurs gate 3 that the reason why I'm giving it negative score for now."
1609843404,yes
1609843233,I like it
1609843164,yes there is bugs i play WAYYYY More buggy messes so im used to it but this game is so much fun
1609842948,"Finished the story after almost 60 hours Ingametime (with lots of sidequest made), just to leave the city with your best bud(butt - 8 years development spent in Panam's model .. worth it CDPR <3 ) in a romance!

The story is really fascinating, the characters you meet are great. Was always thinking how things would turn out for me and the others, if i decided different at some point of the game. They're really staying in my thoughts the whole time, even after playing through the main story.

Due to everybody saying there are a lot of bugs in this game ... have to say there are some, but smaller ones, never had any crash or big problem with the game (i9 9900k/rtx 3800/32gb RAM - fyi)

All in all, i'm really happy with what i saw in this game. Gonna play it again with another playstyle.
Can't wait for the DLCs! 

"
1609842779,Great game.
1609842685,.
1609842524,gwn ruk wel mooie stad ik zal hem niet weer bezoeken
1609842680,"I had fun with cyberpunk 2077, but the question steam prompts you with for reviews is not ""did you personally have fun with cyberpunk 2077"" but rather ""would you recommend cyberpunk 2077 to others"" and frankly, i think you need to be very good at eating around the rotten bits to enjoy this game. i'd recommend it with a big asterisk next to my thumbs up that says ""how good are you at ignoring garbage and how much do you desire keanu reeves carnally?"" when moused over. if the answer is ""not very"" to either i'd say just replay deus ex or something. generally this sentiment is best represented with a ""no"".

the game itself is not really all that well-designed; the leveled world is poorly communicated which means occasionally the game will lead you to a cool encounter that you'll realize too late in needs to be saved for when you're Stronger (though how much stronger the game refuses to say), the world is packed with Gigs, and like maybe a third of them are actually enjoyable or lead to something novel, with the rest being deeply uninspired fight/sneak through area and kill target/take item affairs. you get your phone blown up all the same when you invariably drive past these gigs, and the game does a very poor job of organizing these calls and texts and voicemails that you are practically assaulted by in every area you enter.
most traits and abilities when you level are +3% damage or +10% reload speed or +30 health which feels like [i]nothing[/i] for most of your time with the game. occasionally you progress enough in a skill where you get something new to do but by the halfway point of the game you'll have exhausted all of those cool new options without even really trying. assuming they're good, of course. you can get a knife-throwing skill that [i]destroys the knives you throw permanently[/i] on use (this actually kind of rules in a meta-sense, because it is such an insanely stupid and impractical ability that it feels like a convoluted, surrealist punchline to the world's most elaborate joke)

that said, v and johnny are a fun pair of protagonists, and their dynamic is surprisingly smooth throughout. the game really dovetails a lot and doesn't give you many big plot-affecting decisions for the bulk of its run but you [i]can[/i] more or less reliably choose how v reacts to the world around them, and going along with a friendly, idealist v to contrast the more cynical and acerbic johnny is a lot of fun conceptually, especially as the story continues and the fates of the two become more intertwined. certain members of the supporting cast are similarly strong, and i found myself ringing up these characters of my own accord just to see what's going on with them. there is a scene, in this game, where you attend a funeral, and it is [i]fantastic[/i]. the characters in this game at their best are a joy to be around. at their worst they can be pretty bad, though, and enough of the cast is composed of rather forgettable stock archetypes that it becomes a problem at points remembering who is who, what they do and why they matter.

night city itself is a character, but its characterization is more....inconsistent. it's a bleak and hopeless place, which fits the tone for cyberpunk, but a lot of cdpr's attempts to write it as seedy and sex-obsessed fall flat when you gaze upon the city and see the same three billboards repeated ad infinitum. their presence also tends to undercut the game's more serious scenes, and night city's obsession with sex is more ""everyone on earth is a 14 year old googling boobies"" than ""shameful and dehumanizing objectification of human beings by corporations"". the objectification really only works one way, too--as a friend put it, keanu reeves beats you up and the game is too cowardly to frame it as even [i]kinda[/i] hot.
there's a pretty repulsive queen stereotype you bump into about halfway through the game during a sidequest whose whole deal is that he's a sex freak who sells faulty prosthetics to debt-ridden prostitutes and it made me roll my eyes out of their sockets. there was also a controversy about the chromanticore advertisement and that's kinda whatever but there's a vending machine where the image lines up to make the soda cans come out of her schmeat and that was hilarious actually. the game has some rigid ideas about gender that crop up when you're creating a character, too, but that quickly becomes white noise.
night city is also pitched by the game as a place where the law is not your friend, which is conceptually interesting and suitable for its genre until you actually play the game and it gives you a whole system for picking up gig work from the feds (why does johnny silverhand not immediately kick your ass for accepting this work..?). not very punk rock of you, cdpr

there are five, technically six, endings of cyberpunk 2077 and they all involve doing the same mission, more or less, but with a different entourage (there are, in total, three possible raids on the Final Boss Area, but there are split ending decisions for one, and another ending for the other two). i think i would rank the arasaka endings as my favorite for the sheer contempt the game shows you for siding with the corporation in a game called cyberpunk. it is an incredibly funny ending and going through the body of its endgame with its key advocate throughout the story is an exercise in seeing a kinda cool ""corporate samurai"" dude turned kinda cool ""lives in a van down by the river"" dude complete his metamorphosis into the most miserable middle aged man you know. it rules.

and there's also the elephant in the room: this game's development has a well-recorded crunch problem. i don't think there's a ton to say on it that hasn't been said before, more elegantly, by people way smarter than me, but i really think it bears repeating that this is a game and genre about corporations exploiting and dehumanizing their workers and it was made by a company exploiting and dehumanizing its workers. you can likely trace a lot of the problems stated before back to rush jobs done by people on their 80th hour of the week who just want to go home. this isn't to say buying the game is an evil unto itself, i mean--the game's already made, the hours have already been worked. it'd just leave a bad taste in my mouth to drop a review without mentioning it.

in short, night city is a land of contrasts."
1609842128,Having none of the glitch issues or rendering issues other people have had i would recommend it but only on a good gaming pc/laptop at this point
1609842026,good game nearly laughed my lungs out at some of the bugs 6/10
1609842307,"Welcome to Night City chooms.

The ONLY game I bought out of hype. 
I think anyone would agree that CDPR has built too much hype around it over the years. 
And the hype builds over the shadows of the success over Witcher 3.
Now that is good to create awareness in consumers' mind regarding its content but I can say that some of the things they mentioned have been cut in the game or simply have not gotten the time to finish it yet, or should I say, a promised never fulfilled ? Whose fault are these disastrous shit ? I don't fucking know lol. Maybe it is the investor ? The management? It seems like the other developers were not too keen on the formers decision in trying to rush the game out. Should have they delayed ? fucking yes, but then again, other factors come to play as well. Covid and some other shit, chooms.

Now what some of the fucked up things in the game?
Fucking bugs and glitches
- jumped to some walls and force pushed 250 - 400 m away ? haha
- jumped on some walls and instant death
- jumped on some worldly items and instant death
- found some places i shouldnt explore and i fell from the world towards oblivion
- unpickable items on the ground which kinda mess with my fucking mind for 5 minutes straight
- the first person view was not working for me for the immersive shit they tryna pulled. though we can see ourselves in the ending felt like bird released from a cage rather than a reward for all the time spent through it.
- disappearing of clothes that came off and came on, on you and other npcs maybe i should just cum instead
- fucking johnny's subtitle stuck every fucking now and then!!
- i can still see the npc boss's health bar after i nailed their asses
- one of the big bug that was troubling me even towards finishing the stories are damn fucking delamain glitch, his ""glitchiness"" seems to infect all the other character's voice calls with the screen tearing on and off damn delamain you are useless anyway haha
- you get overlayed voice calls, overlayed of npc talking to you, everything is quite messy, its quite shitty

Artificial Unintelligence?
- npc is fucking dumb and lifeless thats for sure.
- random t-posing npchooms just minding his unbusiness ( cos there are none lmao)
- npc doesnt walk, they fucking hover on the ground while moving, same goes to the player 
- ""oh hi mate"" , V said, and when he turned his head 360 ""wtf he is fucking gone""
- npc dont have routines, generic npc with one or two lines
- multiple npc looks the same
- chooms in night city dont use umbrellas when it rained ?
- car npc are fucking dumb as well have i mentioned that ?
- car npc crash 95 % at the tight corner on the player first MEGABUILDING lol
- car npc never find other route if we blocked em since they were just very linear on the road damn
- police just spawn, no build up no nothing, that tetetetettttt alarm is not considered as build up choom
- you cant buy fucking hot dogs on some random streets ? fuck choom im sad
- kinda sad i cant kill everyone, i mean i understand the children, but i cant kill the grown up ? 

There are lots of other shits as well
- no key changes for opening journals and shit wtf?
- menu interface is still confusing for me
- when you pick an item, they will show what you have gotten, well each item i picked there will be like i donno 10 seconds delay? so if i pick 10 items, i had to wait for like.... shit man fix this
- how to know what color is the guns ? wtf
- i cant carry any items except pick them up put in the inventory ? shit even half life 2 can do 
- i dont like the character creation because it felt very limited, thought i have more control on the creation aspect but nah, 
- beard dont grows, hair dont grows, hmmmm
- shit i donno what else to talk about 
- crashed my pc many times hopefully not damaging any of my hardware 

My friends were very excited in playing it from the hype they have developed over the years. Was not going well for them during the launching. But I endured and went on! I am a dreamer, and so is V so I had hope.

Now lets talk about the preem stuffs in the game.

RPG elements
- yeah you can build yourself to whatever fucking role you want, stealth? terminatoresque ? fucking spongebob with a blunt weapon? well maybe not
- i accidentally made myself a mildly tanky hacking tecchy stealth james hitman bond. damn 400k crit damage with a pistol never felt good
- it was quite hard from the start but halfway through you are able to fuck(homicide not sexual) everyone, but still the npc would just one hit you with their sniper, but im a james hitman bond dammit they never see me coming.
-im gonna build tank ninja solo build after they patch the game!
- i like how you can increase the stats of each build and spending time using those builds increases the progression perks which makes you more powerful! felt like skyrim! need more game like these
- kinda bummer you cant be fat, or get dirty, or get skinny, look tanky hm

Story
- 12/10 stories are fucking great, you get to hear keanu reeves say fuck, motherfucker, bitch, shit most of the time he appears!
- though quite a bummer with jackie welles, thought coulda had more time with him but still, preem shit chooms!
- the story was able to transport me miles and miles of emotion cruise, how shit felt different on the streets, on the big city, and with the nomads. and how the character have impacts on the players, damn 
- npc might be dumb, might felt a repetitive on the way they implement the quest, but the backstory of each quest, side quest, gigs, even shitty ncpd jobs are amazing and build little by little the environment and condition of night city.
- hey cdpr put some puzzle on the quest eh, or more monty python silly shit, trust meee brohhhhh
- i cant romance judy tho cos im male V now thats a bummer since i like her ass hmmmmm...*fap (donttellmywife)
- Mr. Blue fucking Eyes man.
- Alt Cunningham...well her story is way too short, hopefully the dlc will have more of her? cdpr?!
- yeah main story was way too short, developers stop listen to shitty journalists pls.

music
- damn thats good bro i love it.
- various battle songs <3
- temperance ending music <3
- johhnny silverhand fuck through arasaka song <3
- nomads songs <3
- fuck the radio though i dont understand how it works really fuck 

Unfair for me to judge the graphics because my monitor is shit but I guess its nice and alright. Some of the views are incredible though!


So to sum it up: Shitty NPCs, immersion fails badly, a whole gallery of bugs and glitches, rushed products, emotional and amazing story but too short! 

8.2/10 hehe im tired of writing giving you a rushed product right here right now 



Alright I write few more,
I adore CDPR,
hope they patch the game to its full potential
I trust these developers
they made Witcher 3, 
the best game I ever played, since GTA San Andreas.

So wait up the patches, and play when it is damn stable.

* Major issues experienced:

- Some mission become unresponsive (had to restart the whole mission for an old auto save). 
personally i had around 25% of my missions become unresponsive.

- Audio overlap when interacting with NPCs and in some occasions when there is background music/conversation near by intermittently the sound of the NPC i'm interacting with becomes low.

- The insane number of times the Frame rate dropped drastically from 50 fps to 10-15 fps while driving and specially at night time. (GTX 1080 overclocked with  1440p low settings)

- The Skill tree is unbalanced if you max out intelligence (hacking) only you are already overpowered.

- The AI needs a huge improvement  - cars can't even manage the road. NPCs don't have any daily routine (mentioned in the trailer) which results in the game becoming boring so quickly.

- The apartment (home) has barley any use other than extra storage and sleeping (you can just skip time from the menu). you are unable to upgrade the apartment or purchase an apartment in another part of the city.
 
- When driving a futuristic vehicle you would expect a self-driving feature like watch dogs sadly that isn't available in the game. 

-------------------------------

Its really sad to see people recommending this game while it's incomplete ( Fallout 76 ).

I would ONLY recommend this game after they release all the features that was promised in the trailer.

"
1609840602,I liked it!
1609840556,"A very good game. Not perfect yet, but it has the potential to be an all time great. With future patches and DLCs I am sure it is going to achieve what it deserved.

Pros :

- Good story
- Awesome OST. ""Everyhing Burns""
- Big World. ( Not fully complete, hopefully with Future Patches. )
- Lovable NPCs
- Lots of Side Quests
- Awesome Graphics
- Secret Ending ( One of the most satisfying final mission I ever played )

Cons :
- Bugs
- More Bugs
- A Lot of Bugs
- Main story is somewhat short
- So many missed oppurtunities. ( They even coded non-gravity walking in the space, that is used for only 30 seconds, in only one of the endings)
- Did I say bugs ?
- Immersion is not contunious. Sometimes it is at its peak, sometimes you feel hollow.
- Bad optimization, even on PC.

All in all I give it 85 out of 100. Played around 400 hours as of now. I am sure with future patches and DLCs, it will reach 99 out of 100."
1609840440,"People may shit on it. call it cyberjunk and whatever. but it feels like a modern skyrim. Awesome game but buggy. And for me, one of the best things to come out in 2020!"
1609840343,"games has lots of bugs and glitches, apart from that game is awsome ."
1609839751,"Haven't encountered any bugs in my first 42 hours. Yeah there are little bits and bobs that could be better, like the ""get out of the moving car"" physics. But overall, it's an interesting story, interesting ways you can mess with your character/build and I don't for a second think I wasted my money."
1609839623,Best Game in the WORLD <3
1609876964,"They advertised this game as the best game ever and gave so many promises. And now we have just some common game like Ubisoft's projects, but I think even those more interesting than Cyberpunk. This game has nice story, characters, atmosphere and art design, but gameplay is quite boring, open world is dead, npcs are dumb, side quests are disgusting, and that's really surprising because CDPR created The Witcher 3 whose side quests are one of the best among all games . Cyberpunk 2077 is a huge disappointment. 6/10"
1609839237,"Your expectations, your problem.
But the marketers screwed up, and the developers are not to blame.
i like this game, all aspects of the game(but physics) and i recommend this game.

And one more think, Panam is better than Judy :DDD"
1609839164,The criticism is extremely exaggerated.  I have experienced fewer bugs than I ever did in games like Skyrim or Fallout even years after launch. The game is very fun and I've enjoyed my time so far.
1609839064,real good game (even if you know it actualy not REplayable) no regret to buy it
1609839504,"Without the bugs, this game is really mediocre. Also this game ended up being nothing what CDPR told and was shown in the wire videos. REALLY disappointed in CDPR for lying. The short main story was good and some side missions, but everything else is avarage / bad. A LOT of content has been obviously cut and the crafting and item systems suck. This was supposed to be a ""RPG"" not an Destiny style linear looter shooter action game. Totally mediocre experience."
1609838726,"I started this game off on my PS5, It was the ps4 version as there is no PS5 version (yet). It was a buggy nightmare, the graphics were visually disappointing and I was overall left unsatisfied with my purchase. Then I downloaded it on steam and had a whole new experience, there was still occasional bugs, but nothing near the unfinished feeling console version, this PC version had better graphics that my system could handle, less graphical and gameplay bugs (even though this one suffers from some bad ones) I was actually more or less happy with the decision to switch. I love this game, but the developers really need to get their act together. This game with over 8 long years of development still feels like a beta. It also needs a lot of optimisation. I get huge frame drops looking at some types of grass and even just entering different areas. I have a RTX 3090 and and i9, this really shouldnt be the case, but with ray tracing it is understandable. Overall I would recommend this game"
1609838935,"Yes, this game had glitches and bug issues on launch, especially on last-gen consoles, and should have been delayed release for them. But despite all that, nothing game-breaking for me on a mid-range PC preventing me from enveloping myself in the rich story and lore of this world/game, and its' characters. The characters are so well-done, some solid character growth in not only main characters, but side and support characters also, and some support characters being a bigger role than others(Panam vs. Misty). O!, and for the love of god, do the character side quests!, it's so much more fulfilling as a game and is great backstory/development, I won't give any spoilers! It's been a long time since I've poured this many hours into a single player experience and just kinda sat there, staring at the screen,with a mix of emotions both good and sad, no matter how you slice it, this is not a fairy tale ending game, just some are arguibly better than others. Almost all bugs, for me at least on PC seem to have been ironed out. The Music, characters and progression, story-line options, and the handful of gritty, bittersweet, or downright horrid outcomes of many things in this game really makes you want to play it again, maybe a lil different next go. Get this game if you're looking for something a little more...human, and will hit you differently when the credits roll and music starts."
1609838510,glitches are bad for now but definitely worth game play. lots for fun
1609838497,"Amazing game pity about the bugs and fps drop but i can deal with it. Cant wait for some performance updates and some dlc info. If i could smash V,s phone i would lol."
1609838416,Once all the bugs are ironed out I believe this will be a great game
1609838305,Buggy but rich.
1609838065,is good
1609837962,"Before I get started: Parts of this game are very, very good. It's everything between, and sometimes during, those parts that stop me from recommending the game.

- The game looks great

- The story is serviceable but lacks any kind of consequence or choice prior to the ending. Also, without spoilers, there is a part where the story just became 100% less interesting to me and I can only think that choice was made late in production

- Voice acting is extremely uneven. I blame the direction and audio mixing more than the actors 

- This game is EXTREMELY EASY regardless of Difficulty settings. This makes the mediocre ""looter shooter"" elements even more unbearable because none of the Weapons really matter

- The Open World is incredibly shallow. It only exists to make pretty screenshots

- Enemy and NPC AI in general is probably the worst I've seen in a AAA game

- Game economy is a mess and makes no sense. From Crafting to earning and spending your money nothing here looks like any thought was put into it

- The Skills and Perks are nearly all a bunch of meaningless stat bumps(For example, a Perk gives you +5% crit chance while a random trash weapon has +100% Crit chance)

- The bugs. My god, the bugs. I have a very high-end PC(top 2% on 3DMark) so it isn't a performance issues. I have encountered over 50 unique bugs, two of which were progression-breaking bugs, and I know there's a lot I still haven't seen

tl;dr? Come back for the ""Definitive Collection"" and you'll have a much better time."
1609838759,"Cyberpunk 2077: a game that could be great, but currently is just pretty good.  I played on PC, so I don't think I encountered as many bugs as people have complained about online.

[b]The Good:[/b]
[list]
[*] the main storyline is great classic science fiction writing - I find that the best science fiction examines ideas and proposes questions about life and morality through a speculative imaginative approach and on that note, cyberpunk 2077 definitely delivers.
[*] Night City - such an amazing looking futuristic city; they really nailed the look (honestly I am a huge fan of the Blade Runner aesthetic), the Arasaka parade is stupid beautiful
[*] combat is pretty fun and offers different play styles - I played as a rifle/pistol wielding hacker (as a formerly corpo V) and put points in Int/Reflex/Tech this time around, and I'm actually excited to try out a melee build for the next time I replay
[*] the soundtrack is amazing 10/10; off the top of my head, I really like ""V's Main Theme"" and ""Outsider No More""
[/list]

[b]The Bad:[/b]
[list]
[*] It's definitely not as much of a RPG as I expected.  The large majority of your decisions, like other people have said, don't really matter: ex. the origin lifepath doesn't matter on quests (just flavor text), not a lot of decisions that you do on previous quests affect future quests/world down the line (and if they do, it's just the next quest and then forgotten about), there's basically only one major decision point that affects the ending and it's pretty obvious.  [spoiler] After you leave Hanako after having talked to her in the final act, you go up to the roof with Misty and you basically make a decision on how the last act and ending will play out through a dialogue option. [/spoiler]  That being said, although it's no Dragon Age Origins level of RPG goodness, it's not as on rails as Red Dead Redemption 2.
[*] Bugs: I did encounter a few bugs but 3/4 were pretty minor.  Some examples: 1) one time I fell through some stairs and died, 2) my car when summoned never stopped and just ran away from me, 3) floating palm trees visual glitch but I fixed that by updating my graphics card drivers, 4) I was unable to complete the CyberPsycho Bloody Ritual quest because the cyberpsycho never spawned (and yes I checked multiple times online that I was doing it correctly but was too far ahead in the game to roll all the way back to before when I first encountered the bug to try and restart).
[*] Enemy AI is not too smart
[*] Cut Content/Could flesh out the world more: I completed every gig/side quest except for 2 and by the end, it did start to get really repetitive because the gangs all felt the same (like nameless mooks I could just mow down for every quest).  Also more unique dialogue options would be nice - some of the ending voicemails don't make as much sense in context because it seems like they just reused the same dialogue for multiple ending choices.  (same with romance lines).  Also, V's lifepath really should matter more than like 2 quick scenes and a montage at the beginning.
[*] Crafting could be better
[/list]

[b]Other Silly Things:[/b]
[list]
[*] why can't I own a Tyger Claw style car/bike? >:( Their modded cars (I still think about the bright yellow Mizutani Shion car I picked up with the neon lights on the windows) and bikes are so much better looking than the default ones.
[/list]

Overall I actually really found myself really enjoying the game despite the bad reviews and would like to replay it once more content is added and bugs are fixed.  It's good scifi at its core."
1609837902,"Ok, the game might be a buggy mess, and Witcher 3 is a better game, but Cyberpunk 2077 is still terrific."
1609837787,very nice
1609837698,"Varied gameplay, an immersive city and badlands experience, and lots of interesting main and side jobs to get lost in."
1609837589,"Next gen game for next gen hardware, 

If you got what it needs, you're gonna have a hard time to stop playing ! 

The fusion between narration and open-world is one of the best part of the game. I've never seen this in an open-world RPG. And the build variety is what makes it so replayable. I'm on my third run right now and it still makes me feel like playing a new game.

The city is breathtaking (sorry :D) and exploration is always rewarded. I'm still fiding new little stuff after two complete runs and 200+ hours ! 
Concerning bugs and glitches, i've got some, but nothing game breaking. The most part was just so funny i can't even be mad about it.

Finally the photomode is just insanely fun ! 

i7 9700k, 2080ti in 1440p RTX everything on ultra, and mostly at 55fps (some small area in the city make it fall to 45ish, others make it go up to 65ish)."
1609837553,"Disappointed is perhaps the best word I can give about this game. 

Most people already talked about the plethora of bugs and technical issues, and these are issues that I'm fairly confident CDPR can swiftly fix within a few months or so. Some of the more difficult bugs (I assume at least), such as the overall AI issues and police response system, might take a while longer, but I'm not a developer so I can't give a clean answer to that one. 

But all that aside, Cyberpunk 2077 is, unfortunately, a fundamentally broken game. Even with most of the technical solutions doled out and patched, the gameplay isn't as unique or as exciting as it makes it out to be. There are a TON of things they've got to add in or fix or better yet, completely revamp, because it's currently not the game they promised to be. Even if they release a few DLCs that manage the current dearth in features such as interactivity with the shops or some basic customization of cars, the gameplay isn't as fun as they advertise it to be. The story, while interesting and great, had some glaring narrative issues (the infamous prologue montage, for one) that detracted away from the 'open world RPG' element that companies like Rockstar mastered.

Now, I'm not really angry at CDPR for not delivering. They were overly ambitious, and I have no doubt they wanted to release an immersive and phenomenal game for their customers. And for what it's worth, I did get some enjoyment in the characters and story. Overall, I'd say this is a very mediocre game. I would be very reserved in recommending the game even with the technical issues fixed."
1609837295,"This joint bussin, downfalls aside"
1609836750,"“Has potential, modding is starting to take off, and bugs are being fixed. Might be better to wait and see where it goes (or watch my gameplay of it, wink wink).”"
1609836684,Can throw grenades at children.  10/10
1609836623,It's Aight
1609836607,"My review in one link: https://youtu.be/_CymqHdNYkg

- gladly refunded
- huge disappointment"
1609836096,"Haven't been hooked on a game this much since New Vegas. That's not an exaggeration, there's just so much to do in this game! so many side missions with interesting short stories and so many places to explore that its easy to just get lost riding around the city. If you can get past the hilarious bugs, there really is something of value here, and beyond the mistakes and botched release you can really tell CD Projekt had great ambitions with this game. Bugs aside, the only bad things about this game are:
1. The beginning is quite slow, so much dialogue. I understand RPG's have a lot of reading, but I know a lot of people personally who said they were put off by how slow the beginning is, which is a shame since the game is so fun once you're allowed to explore the city on your own. 
2. The weapon and system is frustrating. This may be personal preference, but it sucks that weapons get stronger as the game progresses. Destiny did this as well, and it drove me nuts. I hate the fact that I have to give up the weapons and armor pieces I like to use simply because the game keeps throwing stronger guns at me. I wish guns had a consistent damage out put and that instead the focus was put on being able to customize your weapon with several different attachments such as barrels, clips, stocks, etc that would change the stats of a gun. Kind of like Fallout 4 and how you can add mods to your weapons to change their damage out put, firing rate, etc. The armor also gets stronger as the game goes on, but I don't mind it as much as the guns that i'm actively using and seeing most of the game.

That aside, I'm really enjoying this game, and hopefully when the patches roll out, more people come to enjoy what Night City has to offer, I'd rate this game a good 85/100 and post bugs (and if they would change the weapon system) a solid 95/100."
1609835978,Amazing gAME AND SOMETHING FRESH FOR THE INDUSTRY.
1609835912,GOODDDDDDDDDDDD
1609835859,game full of bug but still fun to play
1609835397,"So TL,DR, This game is not worth 60 bucks, but I did enjoy it. The gunplay is mediocre and uninteresting, and the melee combat is just going between killing and heal spamming. The game also runs terribly on a brand new 2k USD machine, new drivers included. Also, hearing about what content was cut makes me really disappointed as that might have changed this review. You are buying a full price game that is still very much a work in progress.

To go more in depth, the combat can be summed up by calling it uninspired. With the exception of the melee vs melee combat, nothing feels fun or mechanically interesting. Unironically, I think the combat tutorial has better combat than most the actual game. The gun systems sound interesting on the surface but honestly I found that the unique ideas in this game are not useful enough to be used as a primary, which means more often than not you are going to find yourself just pointing and clicking like every other game, but as I said, that doesn't feel good in this game. 

There really isn't the insane level of customizability as I was expecting, which is a factor too. If you mainly wanted to get this as a really cool cyberpunk world you can make a cool punk character in, the base game might be a tad disappointing, but I hear that the mod community is already hard at work for alot of stuff. I can't attest to that but I can say that despite being disappointed, I was able to make a character I was happy with. That being said, it's truly surprising that you have so little actual customization that is actually punk, piercings come in sets and you can't switch the sides of them, while there are a ton of eye options they don't have the actual eye tattoos that actual people have right now. Clothes have armor values, so you often have to switch from good looking clothes to good performing clothes. I think you can upgrade them but I am not sure, I know you can do that to keep some of the cooler looking ""iconic"" weapons up to snuff. Overall, it's missing alottt on the cosmetics side, which was the reason I and a few others ended up buying it.

The performance issues are pretty disappointing as well, my rig is an AMD 3900x, RTX3070 (couldn't find a 3080 in my country by the time the game came out), 16 gb ram, and everything is running off of an SSD. And this game is still too much for it on very high + ray tracing (with DLSS mind you=. Turning off ray tracing sometimes helps, but it's honestly very inconsistent. My partner with lower specs can still run it at 60 with lower settings, but honestly it's going to be disappointing for everyone's rigs. This game is demanding.

Lastly, the endings and story fucking suck, no other way to say it. There's like one good one, and no matter what you chose you don't get to continue to play in night city. If you want to, you have to load up your old save from right before the final mission and just ignore all that shit as if it's not there, despite the game really pestering you and wanting you to go do the final mission still with all of the screen glitches. Honestly can't wait for someone to mod a fresh start thing into this like the popular skyrim mod so that I can stop listening to Johnny Silverhand be a piece of shit person or so that my screen stops glitching out because the game never lets you wrap up the cause of it, my enjoyment of this game will go way up.

But if you buy it, I genuinely hope you get enjoyment out of it. CDPR really rushed this out, but it is still fun at times."
1609835311,Nice World
1609835194,"I think it's fun, there's bugs, some weird graphics issues here and there, however they are fixing them steadily with patches, but for PC it overall runs nicely. Story is fun, and a bit emotional depending on which way you take your life in the game. Overall I think it's fun, it suffers from mass overhype and letdown syndrome. Not really sure why people were hyping this game up like crazy in the first place, maybe because Keanu Reeves said a thing or two about being in the game on a stage? If you go into this game expecting it to be a ground breaking achievement in video game history then you will surely end up disappointed lol."
1609835086,"Great game Honestly,
Only downside is that the last side quest i need is Delamains quest and it bugged out for me.
other than that the bugs aren't completely Broken to the point where it's unplayable.
(aside from the completionist in me being mad about the uncompleted bugged out Delamain quest)

The music, voices, and emotion put behind the story really brings it to life and creates an enticing story that makes you want to play until the end.

Kerry Eurodyne's Boat song best song"
1609908796,"[I completed the main quest as a Streetkid, and completed (I believe) ALL of the side quests. I played with an i7, 32GB of RAM, an NVMe SSD, and a 3060Ti. There will likely be spoilers.]

[h1]INTRO:[/h1]
Merchants yell in the street. Monitors and stereos blare commercial after commercial to those that pass-by. Someone bellies up to the vendor to grab ramen. As the sun goes down for another day - neon pierces through the air, and fog begins to settle in the streets. As another day begins to transition, another way of life begins to fill the sidewalks, alleyways, and parks. Night City, night or day, rain or shine, dust storm or not - lives and breaths.

One thing is for certain: if the developers were trying to make it feel like a real city, they did a damn good job. Markets are bustling with people. Styles change when you approach different regions. One area might be filled with local art and trash in the alleyways, others might be clean with high-end cars. Parts of the cities change in architecture and style, not only compact or spread out in regions - but also built differently vertically.

But once you look past the masterful world-building CD Projekt Red put into this - you realize one thing: There was a lot of missed opportunity here.

[h1]TRANSPORTATION/EXPLORATION:[/h1]
The cars drive horribly. Through mods, this can be improved but… I can’t help but feel like it was intended for controller use. Just holding W, you can’t get any grip and hook up - consistently spinning tires for numerous cars. I imagine with a controller, throttle response would make more sense with gradual trigger presses vs analog “THE KEY W IS ON LOL.”

The rail system was clearly abandoned, and will hopefully? make it back in the game in a later update or DLC. Accessible aspects of the map are unfinished - and the rail system website is even “under construction.” But they have these “fast travel” locations placed all around the map. Feel like they could have done something specific to that zone, maybe V getting in a bus or a taxi or something while it shows the map you’re going to…

If you liked exploration, driving around, etc. from like GTA V, then you’d like this aspect.

Though it is worth noting: The majority of buildings, you can’t get into. And not only that but if you can - they are only enterable once - or only one room/one level. It is also worth noting that there is no vehicle customization. Which, in a world all about making yourself unique/standing out...

[h1]COMBAT:[/h1]
Fun. But not as revolutionary as one would think. “Mods” really are just stat changes to how much damage you do, reload time, etc. Instead of making for unique experiences, you’re just leveling to make super OP weapons. I think if I were to play again, I’d do a stealth gameplay - with physical weapons like a katana, or cybermodded arms. Currently, I just go in guns-a-blazing and fuck everything up in insight. No one stands a chance, and I’m done in just a few seconds. Feels like Borderlands.

Also, it is worth mentioning it is missing the wall-running like they once showcased at e3 2018.

[h1]CRAFTING/INVENTORY:[/h1]
I am curious if the developers anticipated hoarders like myself. I was constantly picking up weapons, and breaking them down. But the inventory management system made it brutal. You can’t mass break-down items, and the sorting needs to be expanded upon for specific categories like clothing.

I believe there are skills you can level up to increase how much you get in return from breaking things down but it never felt like enough. I was constantly having to go to a street vendor and buy Epic components for some reason.

[h1]SKILLS/CYBERMODS:[/h1]
I think I touched on this before but skills do nothing other than really just pad your stats more in a positive direction, making you OP. Cybermods on the other hand can change how you play, affect enemies you fight against, etc.

Figuring out Ripperdoc had the best gear for certain Cybermods was so cumbersome, time intensive, and frustrating for me. I wish I didnt have to travel around the map to see basically the same items over and over again.

[h1]STORY:[/h1]
Decent. But I did not like the writing of the V’s dialogue in Act 1 or 2. I have a feeling the writers purposely made V (and maybe Silverhand) quite dislikable for them to develop/grow on you as you go through the game… But some of it was just borderline overboard, almost cringe. “Being a living legend” bruh. Maybe the worlds a lot different later on, but it just felt lazy.

The developers showed the complexity of your choices in a demo at e3 one year, about the various layers of choices and abilities you can utilize to your advantage (and sometimes unknowingly, at a disadvantage) - but unfortunately, this did not happen much beyond the mission they showcased in the gameplay demo. Seemed like there were actually very limited dependencies as you move on in the story, much more linear than one would believe. There are of course numerous dialogue options you can use… But the effect is not vastly different in most cases.

One thing I will mention outside of the primary story was the lack of things to do. Like you get a taste of Brain Dances but only when they’re relevant to missions. You’d think there’d be more entertainment options, joy toys to pay for, drugs to utilize, random people, to interact with, etc. for being in the future! Buuuut it just felt like “oh yeah, there’s a lot of cool stuff in this world!” but nothing for you to actually partake in. 

Additionally - there are a million cool items that you collect as you loot around the world but none of them you can actually do anything with. Records? Ashtray? Dildo? Can’t do anything with it, just break it down for components.

I was hoping for more romance options for all options/preferences. Seems limited if you pick just one way, but if you’re open to others you got a lot of options. I don’t know if Joytoys were the response to this but after doing it once there was no real reason to do it again.

“Side gigs” either contribute to the main story, which leads to some interesting development with Johnny, or explore some new parts of the map you wouldn’t normally visit otherwise… But I was quite surprised to see the lack of cut-scenes with all of this. Everything was done from like the first-person view, it felt like.

I wish I didn’t spend all that time doing the reported crimes for the NCPD, what a waste of time. With finding all the cyberpsychos, they atleast had interesting stories or provided “mini”-boss like events...

The thing that makes the story so good is the characters. They are truly unique and a breath of fresh air. The casting did a fantastic job of feeling authentic, having a lot of emotion, etc. Rogue, Jackie, Panam, Judy, the fixers, etc - they’re all unforgettable in their own ways. (The performance I actually found lackluster/broke character for me was Johnny/Reeves.)

[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]
Wonderful world-building and interesting characters will only get you so far; scope creep got CD Projekt Red in a funny place to the point where they had to sacrifice so many elements of the game (that would have made this a perfect title) in order to get this out in time for release. There is so much to expand upon, but as it currently stands - it is a solid foundation.

If you are a fan of open-world RPG's - think Fallout, The Elder Scrolls, The Outer Worlds, KOTOR, Witcher, etc. you owe it to yourself to play Cyberpunk. Below, I will write out specific parts of the game, and my opinions on them.

To start with, the graphics. I'm running a 2080 and Cyberpunk is, without question, the most beautiful game I have ever played. The lighting is perfect, the models for people are absolutely amazing - as well as the animations for them - and everything people-related has a level of detail that's unmatched. You can literally see that Panam has scars from piercings she used to have that are never once shown or mentioned in the game. I will admit that some of the less focused on models can be sub par, and the specific one I'll point to is of the cat. The cat looks like it has never fully finished rendering. Otherwise, it gets a 10/10 on graphics, and I'd challenge anybody to find a game that looks so beautiful in so many different settings.

Gameplay - this game plays like a combo of New Vegas, Deus Ex, and Dishonored. If you don't like the sound of that, I don't care about your opinion, end of discussion. Anybody saying that gameplay options are limited clearly hasn't taken the time to actually explore and find out all the different stuff you can do, cause all three of my V's have had drastically different gameplay styles, to the point where I have to re-learn them if I go back to an old save.

Writing - hands down the best writing of any RPG, ever. Every single character feels well-written and evocative; Jackie Welles is one of the most endearing characters I've encountered in a video game. Johnny Silverhand has a clear charm over people - to the point where even in real life, people are huge fans of him - despite him being a terrorist who killed millions. Panam Palmer is one of the most relatable, wonderful characters I've ever had the privilege of riding shotgun with. Judy Alvarez, as manipulative and awful as she is, still comes off sympathetic. But more importantly, all these characters succeeded in making me feel an emotion of some kind, of getting me invested in the story. In this way, Cyberpunk 2077 truly feels like a story unfolding, and not just a theme park for you to stroll through while random events happen, like a lot of open world RPG's.

Driving - I make a specific section for this to say - the driving in this game is very good, but you won't know it until you get a better car. At first I thought we were back to the awful GTAIV handling of everything, but once you put some eddies into a proper vehicle, you realize how fun the driving is. Give it time in-game, you'll see.

Overall, CP2077 is a wonderful game, and a lot of the vitriol is quite clearly from people who either expected things from the game that were never even close to being stated as the case, or from people who just want to dogpile and clearly never even bothered playing it. I can't speak for console performance, but on a half-decent PC, this has been one of the best gaming experiences of my life."
1609833876,Another masterpiece from CDPR and it will only get better with time as they patch minor bugs and do some qol changes. Also have high hopes for witcher 3 scale DCLs and online mode in future.
1609833840,"Amazing! Utterly Breathtaking, compelling story, beautiful world. Can't get enough!"
1609841128,"I spent 50 hours with this game and since I don't want to continue playing, I want to put my gaming experience in this review.

The Graphics

 the graphics of cyperpunk 2077 are pretty good, the lightings and textures are well done and nice to look at. generally a beautiful game.

Gameplay

the gameplay really breaks the game. the weapon handling doesn't feel good and it's not fun to shoot because the opponents swallow more bullets on hard than juggernauts in mw3. it's just not good. 
driving in the game doesn't feel good either. you can compare it with gta5 when the map is snowy because the cars slide a little too much. and then there is the fact that the minimap is not zoomed out and you miss every 2nd intersection and you feel like a fool every time because you have to guess where to go.
 I don't think I have to mention all the bugs because they can be found everywhere in the game.

 The Story

I thought the story was really good up to the point when I played and that doesn't mean that I stopped because of the story, it's very interesting and the characters are well written.

Conclusion

my conclusion about the game is that despite the good story i rate the game not good. i found it very boring and i didn't enjoy it and in my opinion i would advise against the game. unless you are someone who doesn't really care about gameplay and you play games because of the story then this is a game for you. nevertheless, this game still has a lot of bugs that make the game unplayable. i give this game a 4/10 because it's really boring and just not fun to play and if i want to play a beautiful game i can play red dead 2.

but it is from CD PROJEKT RED so it has to be a 10/10"
1609833468,"Currently a bunch of stuff is broken, and there are features that rub me the wrong way, but overall it's a wonderful game. I won't get my hopes up that things are fixed in patches, but to me it's worth it as is right now."
1609833274,"I'll start off this review with a quick rating system for those of you who don't want to read a long review.

Graphics - 8/10 (played on medium)
Sound - 9/10
Music - 10/10
Gameplay - 9/10 
Characters - 6/10
World - 12/10
Combat - 8/10 
Story - 7/10
Replayability - 4/10

Overall - 9.3/10

Alright, now comes the juicy stuff for those who are still around. I'll elaborate on all these scores.

Graphics - Oh boy, where do I even start? The game looks incredible, even on medium settings due to my computer's limits. Never did I stop and look at a poorly made texture, think about some weird low-poly model I saw. The game looks amazing no matter what you look from and at. Night City is amazing and captured perfectly down to every last detail. Love it.

Sound - The sound of this game is incredible. Every action has its own response. I often found myself walking around some old, worn buildings just to hear the sound of my footsteps and the crunching of stones and glass beneath by feet. Don't even get me at the eargasmic gun sounds. Every single sound of the weapons in this game, well, you just can't get enough. One weapon I remember fitting into this well was the Carnage shotgun. I mained that shotgun just to hear and feel it. It feels incredible.

Music - Yes. I have nothing else to say but yes. I'm a sucker for electronic music and this HIT. THE. SPOT. The tunes turning up when you get into combat just feels so good, preparing you for the fight and getting you so pumped up. Another thing, getting into your vehicle and turning on NightFM feels so right. It's some of the best music out there, on par with Payday 2 and Boneworks. It's great.

Gameplay - The game feels great. One specific thing I'd like to highlight is driving, since many people seem to hate on it. Driving is great if you know what to do. I myself am a sucked for racing games, and I was able to catch up to this game's driving mechanics very quickly. Hell, I even struggled to handle Forza afterwards. Anyway, enough of my racing game nerd tirade, the game controls very well, and just feels natural to play.

Characters - Here's where the game starts to dip down a bit. The characters are forgettable, boring and flat. There's a few good ones mixed in there though, ones that really touched me and felt good to talk with. Most of them are just boring though. Now, the designs? Incredible. Every person looks unique, and you never see repeat models. 

World - No arguing, this is the best part of the game. Night City and its surrounding areas are the best part of the game. It felt amazing to get into my car and just cruise around Night City. It feels like a living, breathing city, and like it's be there if you exist or not. if you like good open world design, get this game. It is TOP TIER.

Combat - Combat in this game feels great, and there's a lot to learn. When to lean out of cover, use items, all the works and more. Not to mention the feel of every gun and things like that. It's perfect. Using a healing item has huge impact, and every gun you use feels powerful. Shotguns and sniper rifles capture this the best; the sheer powerful blast of a shotgun or massive boom and head-bursting power of a sniper rifle cannot be beaten. I recommend doing side quests to level up before tackling the main story for sure, though.

Story - The story of the game feels real, and it's very easy to follow. I myself often struggle with remembering things in complex stories, and the story of Cyberpunk 2077 was easy to follow and kept me engaged for every part of it.

Replayability - Certainly the most lacking part of the game. Doing the same things over and over again is not much fun, it's like watching a movie after having someone spoil everything. There's just nothing there to really keep you engaged. There's no different paths to take, so it gets boring after only one playthrough.

Overall - Go and buy the game, it's great! Sure, many people complain about it being a buggy mess, but I experienced very few problems during my playthrough. I have a Ryzen 7 1700 and a GeForce GTX 1060 3GB and it ran fine, so you don't need to steal a spare server from Nvidia if you want to play the game. Plus, the game will continue to be patched and optimized as time goes on. Now get in Night City and live your best life!"
1609833003,"Needs another year of polish, minimum."
1609832958,"Too glitchy, too many bugs. Too much dialogue. Gameplay is literally only about 5 hours the rest of the time is sitting, standing, and talking."
1609832580,it fun
1609832464,is good
1609832397,"It's a very rare, that a game makes me want to re play it. But there is something about this game that makes me not want to put it down. This game has BUGS, and I mean big flying beetle bugs, but it has a certain charm that makes me OK with it. The driving can be a little wonky at times but over all I like it. And the story is FANTASTIC. this game was more than worth the money, I wish i could play it for the first time again."
1609832176,"Still a few bugs, but I'm having fun and there a lot to do"
1609832017,lie
1609831987,Hey has its Glitches here and there but overall a great story and awesome game on PC  8.4/10
1609831856,"Cyberpunk 2077 is an awesome game. Sure, it has minor, major, and pretty darn fatal bugs - but if you can manage to handle the bugs, it's a good game otherwise. Just keep that in mind though when playing; bugs do exist and they will (almost certainly) haunt you. Thankfully the devs are actively patching the game."
1609831743,"Great game !!!.  Blame stock holders for early release,  not the guys from CD RED that worked their butts off. This game shouldnt be realsed for old consoles i.m.o.  Cheers !  Niech zyje Polska !"
1609831725,"It has bugs, but don't be fooled. On PC, with adequate hardware, the game runs well, looks great, and is fun and engaging. Writing, voice acting, side quests, immersive world, it's all well done. It will never satisfy those with impossible standards though."
1609831696,couple bug her and there but FUUUUUCK ITS GREAT ANYWAYS
1609831687,"yes it's buggy, but it's also a damn good game and I have no regrets."
1609831489,"I got this on launch day. I got the Witcher 3 on launch day. I LOVED The Witcher 3. BUT this game. Filled with bugs, a story and atmosphere that felt dead. No cars on freeways, AI have a determined path and cannot change that path. NPC’s all react the same whether shot or stabbed. This is worse than a 10 year old game. I had hopes till it was delayed and knew. Once they delayed after going gold they were doomed. DO NOT BUY PLAY GTA V if need be."
1609831353,Fuck what people are saying!!  play this fucker your self and get in there deep
1609831320,"There are spoilers: So I really wanted to like this game. But as a Black woman i am once again left out of the success of the games story-lines. First of all There is no account, and I mean NO account for racial subtleties in Haitian and Black ""american"" interactions. ( its like your Haitian characterizations were pulled from a movie) White writers would naturally be clueless, white american culture is not great at this. They talk and treat you like your character is white, and its written this way as well, its so confusing, i actually get called a gringo by one of the quest characters, so maybe its just another Blackface, like my character is actually registering as white, kinda turned me off.

Then there is the Lesbian issue. Like the Blackface issue, we need you to hire lesbians of color to help you form your stories okay. I expected Judy to at least be like Panaam in the fact that her missions carry weight and rewards, and give the the sense of triumphing over her enemies. I still cannot understand why the tyger claws who are literally just idiot AI's have to win in her scenario. ( I would've thought everyone was ready to see sex trafficking pimps get their asses kicked, its creepy when you cant put pimps in their place.) but I guess that isn't all of us. I mean after 2020 get us a freaking break,not only does she have too much ineffectual actions in her missions,but its basically just defeat, its not hard in the scope of the story line to let us topple a gang. Take over their operation, I'm 74 hours into the game and I feel like my only friend died (Jackie) , my lover is poor and sad and all i do is run around and shoot at morons for other richer morons only to spend most of my time fighting for some street cred (that doesn't do anything) not to mention the no respect having white boy trying to steal my body to live out his failed life. Cringy

After 2020, that don't hit the same CD Project RED. 
After 2020, that don't hit the same CD Project RED.

The interruptions you get when you romance Judy are much more jarring, then you don't get to finish her special mission because Johnny? Your character at this point is strangely oblivious about the obvious backlash from assaulting the tyger claws leaders (you straight up murder them then leave???) and just leaves Judy and the ""dolls to fight for themselves.

Cringy

Your literally running around in the game trying to level up and act like a Boss in the city, which V actually does do, that why it feels like the neglect to Judy's story-line is intentional. The dialog had me cringing almost the entire time, V sounded like and immature boy looking for a one-night stand despite the fact that I'm specifically pursuing the woman as an ally, as a love interest, not a second apartment.

Cringy

Please stop writing tragedy  porn for lesbians and celebrate more than just Hetero- white male love.  I  know everyone doesnt celebrate different races, and love perspectives, and I know you have a couple of women on the team already, but this was a miss. Please consider healthy well thought out and expressed criticism. 
Judy doesnt not feel finished and after loosing Jackie, there should be a bright spot for your lesbian gamers, as well as your gamers who are Black Women"
1609831312,"Awesome game, sure it has it share of bugs but it's a really good RPG and it's only going to get better with the upcoming fixes + DLC's AND the 2 future expansions. I would say the best way to enjoy as much as possible this game is going into it but at a slow pace, invest (put) yourself on V's life and do many of the side quests and Gigs you can do, it's a really an amazing experience for sure."
1609831271,"as of a few weeks after launch and a couple updates, i LOVE this game. it is VERY buggy, but the story is VERY epic. highly addictive!"
1609831208,I don't recommended this game. There are better games out there that are better to buy at full price.
1609831150,This game has potential give it a chance one you get into it its a shit ton of fun
1609830957,"This game F***s like a dump truck. 
Play it. The bugs are nothing. The story, the lore. 
That's the good stuff."
1609830909,you have to be able to look past bugs but I have had a blast playing this game.   I personally can't wait for more DLC and story to come out.  That might be the perfect time to hop in if you are worried about bugs and the like.
1609830822,"I wasn't sure what to expect when i bought this game. I had watched a few videos of game play and had a basic idea of what to expect, but what i got was 100% better than i could have ever hoped for.  
i haven't found a game in a while that makes me debate going to bed or not.  
if you're looking for a solo play through game with great skill trees and new gun mechanics, look no further. 
i have only found a couple bugs since playing, and they were easily solved with loading a previous save.  

10/10 would recommend"

EDIT.....Oh hes fine, Butt Wine...enough said"
1609830508,"By far the best open world game of its type. Replacing Fallout 4 and Wasteland 3 as my go to game. 

Yes, it has some bugs. Doesn't really affect PC badly.  I wish they had more cars, I wish they had more guns, etc. But its really a wonderful game."
1609830276,GTA and Borderlands had a baby with Skyrim type glitches. Enjoy!
1609830197,"just a buggy mess, with little to redeem itself so far"
1609830177,"This game is a horribly buggy mess. It is not a good game. Even if all the bugs were fixed, it wouldn't be a game worth $40, let alone $60. The driving is terrible, feeling floaty and unresponsive regardless of the vehicle you choose. Speaking of choice, there is basically none - your decisions in game largely have NO EFFECT WHATSOEVER. 
Want to shoot from vehicles when driving around? NO.
Want to change your appearance after your start the game? NOPE.
Want to drive across the city without losing control of your vehicle? GOOD LUCK.
Want to see where you need to drive displayed on the road ahead so you can focus on the world around you? FUCK YOU, LOOK AT THE TINY MINI-MAP THAT DOESN'T GIVE YOU ENOUGH TIME TO MAKE YOUR TURNS.
 
And then you have the bugs. They are numerous, they happen every session, and are a constant distraction at best, and force you to restart missions at worst because they soft lock the game. 

This isn't the game we were promised. This isn't the game they advertised. This is an arduous and padded story of some douche named V whose story you have to live through, as opposed to create/influence. There is almost no point in this being a game, as opposed to a Netflix series.  Do you want to see pretty things, and not think too hard? Buy this ""experience"", you moron. If you want a series of fun and exciting choices, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. IT IS NOT GOOD."
1609829978,"At the time of writing this review I saw countless bugs, game breaking glitches, audio bugs that req reloading, guns not showing, poor texture qualities on load in, had 1 crash, quests not showing up or starting upon reload, character models glitching out in t poses or just disappearing off the face of night city and you know whats the craziest part of all that is I REALLY love this game despite all the issues listed above which are not even all of them. Here is a quick pros and cons for my feelings of this game

PROS

+The story was a slow start to me but after the introduction mission I was hooked the premise and the motivation checked all the right boxes for me and the ending I got felt like a personal tailored ending for all the choices I made in my 83 hours of playing. The story is just as good of quality as their previous games coming from someone who has played every witcher game 
+The gun play is so smooth and the variety of weapons and customisation is great. I like the slick animation each gun has when you equip it for the first time, I always loved picking up an upgrade and thinking what cool animation will play this time. 
+I maxed out intelligence because I loved the quick hack system it felt like mass effects biotic class where I am telepathically slinging spells and I got to the point on normal difficulty where I could clear a room without even shooting a bullet. 
+ The cars and driving were a delight, the variety of cars really incentivise me to go and collect them all and test each of them out, some are good for the city while some are good for the desert area it made choosing them feel meaningful although I had my go toos
+ The skill system is very fallout esque and it also translated to skill checks in conversation and the environment much like the fallout games as well. It was always a tough choice to pick a skill and it felt impactful and not just another stat stick I was throwing on my character. 

CONS
-As listed above the amount of bugs and glitches. The amount of times I had to reload were way too high for an 80 dollar title
-Stats on the clothing are only armor and other traits it felt like a tacked on part of the game I would have been fine if clothing was purely cosmetic and the skill tree led to increase in certain stats. 
-the question marks from witcher 3 make their return as ncpd scanner hustles and just like witcher 3 they are usually 1 of 3 things and I completed them all but they were just about as interesting as witcher 3 question marks, I feel like these were another tacked on item for pure completionism 
- The AI in this game is brain dead and more work definitely needs to be done on the way they react to V especially during combat. 

In short I cannot wait to see this game in a completed and finished polished state the amount of fun I have had in its current state really shows how good of a game this is to its core and that really makes me look forward to what cdpr has planned for it in the future. I hope they take as much time and loving care on DLC like they did with the witcher 3 DLC as I will definitely be jumping back in to play those. This game gets an 8/10 for me. 

"
1609829960,this game is so good(bad). there are no(lots of) glitches. i would (not) reccomend this game to anyone.
1609829716,"Fantastic writing and a rich atmosphere really make you want to explore the city. The setting is enough to hook you, and the gunplay is really fun if you like to jump and slide. Game is already more stable than when first released."
1609829667,"I just don't know man... this was definitely not the game that they promised.
It feels like the game is still in it's early-alpha phase with its open-world elements. 

I will change the review depending on how things change."
1609829507,"Here are my specs. 
FX-8350
GTX-970
4GB VRAM
16GB 
And I played this game on a 1TB HHD

This game was amazing. 

Its story was by far the best part, It was gripping and had me in tears at the end, it truly rivals the best movies/TV Shows, This game has loads of narrative choices and I felt like I truly made an impact on the story. 

I played this game on medium graphics settings and averaged about 30FPS Which is still makes for a very beautiful gaming experience. They're visual bugs but they were far and few between, They were mostly funny if anything. 

The combat was fun and stylized, though a tad easy I would recommend playing on hard."
1609829296,"Good main story, beauitful city/environment. Shooting/melee was pretty fun, too. 

Negatives: Incredibly dumb AI (worse than GTA San Andreas), dumb enemy AI, no police chases, city sometimes looks like a PS2 environment. Bad physics and attention to detail. Map is crammed full of icons and objectives and becomes overwhelming. Bad driving controls. Can't ride the cool futuristic train and can't pilot/ride the hovercrafts except for missions. I was expecting much more from this game. I think it would have been better if it weren't open world, because the open world to me felt quite lifeless and fake compared to other open world games. However, the story and environmental design make this game worth recommending.
6/10, try to nab it for $30 or less"
1609829176,"Besides all of the bugs, the game is pretty fun. The story is very immersive, the environment is intriguing, and the dialogue is fun. The game is poorly optimized though, and the glitches can be frustrating, Hopefully these issues will be patched in time, but overall I recommend playing."
1609829128,"I'd love to revisit this game later this year and see the improvements. It's unfortunate it shipped in the state it did and inexcusable for last gen consoles, but the PC release is at least playable. Cyberpunk 2077 has a way to go before it feels properly optimized and some of the design decisions are questionable but easy to fix. 

The story itself is extremely well written and keeps you engaged while exploring the streets of Night City, Already I can imagine how vastly different the outcomes of future playthroughs will be based on some of the decisions I made this go around. Even the side quests are well thought out and mostly lead to satisfying results. The game also has an abundance of loot to collect with many distinct effects and interesting ways to play. 

My first playthrough was on Very Hard where I completed 100% of the side quests. The gunplay itself is a little shoddy coming from other shooters that feel more thought out. Melee seems like it could be fun, but some of the AI reactions and the way they slide to land a hit that you could have easily avoided just doesn't feel good. At the moment there is no way to reassign the dash which procs when double pressing a directional key (either W,A,S, or D) making it super annoying to make minuet corrections while lining up a shot in ADS, usually breaking your stealth as was the case many times in my playthough. Some cutscenes also force you into a 75 FOV with no way to correct it after the scene other than reloading your save. On two occasions characters called me during dialogue where I needed to select a timed option and it wouldn't let me select until the phone call was finished.

Overall Cyberpunk was enjoyable and like I said earlier I'll be revisiting it in the future. I just wish CD Project Red would have marketed this release for what it is, an early access title."
1609828891,"If you read Snow Crash by Neil Stephenson before playing you will absolutely love feeling like you are Hero Protagonist with your 50K damage Katana you can find in the first few sequences of the game. If you watch Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, you will feel like you are the Major with your rapid quick hacking to make mince meat out of your opponents. 10/10 game."
1609828745,ver gud
1609828742,The only good thing that came out of 2020!
1609828498,"epic bugs can be funny, rarely game breaking. Nice game, only buy if u hab good pc"
1609828403,Good game and story so far
1609828300,Everything is perfect besides graphics. Buy this game.
1609828179,"Great story, amazing music, likeable characters, and the best designed city ever in gaming. Combat is fun and visceral, but numbers-wise could use a good bit of balancing at higher levels."
1609828157,Very much love the game so far.
1609828128,"good but not amazing.
the hype definitely hurt the game. the dialogue, story, and character interactions were by far the best aspect of the game. the gameplay loop is fun, though. moreso an illusion of choice rpg vs actual consequences until the final few choices."
1609828109,"overall great story, looks amazing if your PC can run the game properly."
1609827846,"It's a fun game, but it's obvious a lot of content has been cut out. It's buggier then day one skyrim release. 

If you want to buy it knowing it's buggy and essentially an ALPHA RELEASE then have at it. I've put 41 hours into it and I've had a blast.

I've also encountered more bugs then I could keep track of and many of them so different from one another. 

Honestly, wait til 2022 and maybe this game won't be so rough."
1609827710,awesome game - not a huge fan of the combat but other wise game is incredible.  I love the city!
1609827576,So buggy you'll need a terrarium.
1609827568,Lots of buds but still fun to play
1609827510,"[spoiler] The Devil ending is just like real life... grind and toil aimlessly for a corporation to end up on an operating table, afterwards told you will die in six months. [/spoiler] Good game though."
1609827403,"OMG It's so bad that No Man Sky seems like an okay game
Jesus Christ lord saves us"
1609827386,"I have hardly played the game, and I cannot deny the game is pretty and the graphics are excellent.

However, I am very disappointed in the NPC's/nightcity and gameplay. Nightcity is big, but it is dead, no character. It is like a big pretty painting, but doesn't really feel alive to me. How is this different from any other ""great"" open world game??? The claims that the devs made was something I was really looking forward to, and that would separate CP2077 from other open world games.

It could just be me, but I also found (playing on normal), the game mechanics was a bit confusing to learn. Shooting, hacking, and just moving from point A to B in a gun fight, just has left me feeling a bit lost.

I only had one bug I noticed, but enough to get annoyed.

For now, I really have lost that glorious CP2077 motivation to play the game. If you are looking for a game that was promised, besides great looking graphics, then give this a wait until maybe June 2021 when they should have made a overhaul by then. At least they promise to, but we know how promises go with CDPR."

The game is a ton of fun and I am having the blast while running it on a 1080TI I have had friends running it on a laptop and lower end computers and are getting smooth gameplay at lower FPS. Unless you have a RTX card that can use DLSS you are not getting 60FPS. Bug experience can vary person to person my recommendation  is buy the game use the 2 hours to see how it runs skip through everything and just mess around then refund accordingly

1609827229,"Great game, imo it needed one more year of developement to be polished and bug free but the investors and players kept pushing CD Projekt Red to release the game early, as of right now, hotfix 0.6 the game is not as good as GTA 5 but is way above other Open world gta like games, let's wait for the next big patch and see if there's a huge difference.

I run the game in stable 60 FPS Ultra graphics with Reshade preset, people who buy this game on console should kill themselves."
1609827180,"Doesn't live up to the hype. Still worth 60$, very pretty and engaging. Does not feel like a waste of time to play."
1609827168,"The game is really fun!  It reminds me of Fallout with it's perk system.  I already am thinking of a second type of character to play when I replay it, and during the story, it seems like you can chose different options to double cross people or not.  The hacking and combat are fun.  Some things, like the hacking, aren't explained well, and I needed to look up tutorials.

It plays well with my RTX 2070 Super, around 45 fps with low ray tracing, at 2k resolution.  I get a few graphics bugs, but nothing show stopping.  Your character doesn't show up in reflections, but others do for some reason.  Sometimes your character shows up naked in bathroom mirrors that you have to turn on.  I've heard of other people getting corrupted saves, but it hasn't happened to me yet thankfully.

If you have a nice PC system, I'd give this game a try.  It took me three times to get into Witcher 3, and that game finally hooked me for about 80 hours of play.  This one hooked me right off the bat, and I'm 30 hrs in now."
1609827084,"It's buggy as shit at times, and sometimes you have to reload a save, but overall if you're trying to have fun with it and not really nitpick, it's a good game. Overall, needs some general bug fixes and QOL fixes, but it's an wasy 8/10"
1609826982,"PLEASE ignore what the negative reviews are saying. Yes, i will admit the game has bugs but they ARE NOT GAME BREAKING. The developers themselves are STILL working on fixes and patches. Lets not forget we STILL play skyrim in 2021 and the game is full of bugs and glitches. Witcher 3 also started out a mess and now a days its one of the BEST titles out there. Give this game a break and the developers time to do their job. The game so far is great, love the story, love the rpg elements, and the gameplay isnt bad as some reviewers make it out to be. im no expert critic or have a phd in journalism like people from ign and whatculture among other critic and journalists.  But Im speaking as a common gamer like most of us. The game is good with the potential to be one of the greats and even with all the backlash, unjustful lawsuits and what not, the devs are still putting hours into making this game great. so yea i fully recommend the game and its 59.99 dollars worth. ive had ALOT of fun playing this game so far even if im in the first act, i know im in for a wild imaginative futuristic and amazing ride as i keep putting hours into it."
1609826678,Not a single bug works perfectly
1609826672,Haven't had any bugs of note since launch. Fantastic game
1609826575,"Maybe after CDPR fixes the game, I will recommend it. As it stands now, the amount of bugs really takes away from the excellence that is the immersive story line."
1609826320,"
."
1609826236,"Very buggy, but if you can get over that, really good game. Love the story and the hacking."
1609826107,"if you can get past the bugs, the main story is beautiful. While it might not have the depth of the Witcher 3, I had a great time. Trust Panam, it's worth it."
1609826102,Its fun some small graphical glitches. Gun fights are exciting and thrilling without being super hard.
1609826092,"yeah there are some bugs, but it's a really fun game with a good story.  hopefully everyone being so dramatic doesnt turn the company off from continuing to make improvements."
1609826087,Panam's ass god damn
1609825993,"A negative review at 135 hours played? What is this hypocritic nonsense?! Before you move onto the next review, please take a moment and read this one. I wanna start off by saying I went into this game basically blind. I wasn't a part of the hype train, and I certainly avoided any news as I simply wanted to enjoy the aesthetic and gameplay. On the basest level of what to expect from a game, for me this game is a solid 9/10. Very fun gameplay all around, fantastic graphics (when there aren't visual glitches), wonderful characters (Jackie best boy), and a very interesting story. I'd highly recommend getting this game... In a few months when they release all the bug patches. I actually didn't run into to many glitches in my playtime. Especially nothing to game breaking. Sometimes I'd fall through the ground, but the game would pop me back to the surface level quickly enough. On occasion I would step off the some stairs only to have my whole skeleton collapse and be greeted by loving death. The reason why I wouldn't recommend this though is due to the current issue I am facing. I've crashed twice in all this time. Twice?!?! That's nothing for such a well known buggy game. Only issue is the second time has made the game literally unplayable. I can't load save games, create new characters, or start anything without the game crashing at the loading screen every time. I even attempted to erase all my old saves, goodbye my three 30 plus hour characters, as well as reinstalling the game. It didn't fix the issue at all. In fact the game seems even buggier than before with the character models textures spiking off in all directions. At the moment until this bug is discovered and fixed, I can't recommend this game. It might as well be a digital brick."
1609825957,Runs great so far on 3080
1609825828,I loved it
1609825729,"I have really enjoyed this game so far, I am about 27hrs in and I have had a great time.
There are a few bugs here and there but on the whole it's quite good. Generally the main bugs I see are to do with dialogue overlapping. 
Night City is awesome to explore and there are loads of side missions to do. 
If you are not keen on dealing with the bugs, put this game in your wishlist and wait for a few patches - but definitely do play it at some point."
1609825570,Even though it has its issues its pretty fun and the story is very well done
1609825359,"Yeah its pretty good, kinda depressing... but very fun. Has some issues/bugs but nothing game breaking for me def needs some polish and I can't wait to play through it again in 6-9 months."
1609825049,.
1609824956,Buy it.
1609824802,This game really feels like an alpha game. Its like they skipped the QA step and just rushed it out without any playtesting..... or debugging..... or even looking at the final compiled code for that matter.
1609824799,"I was gonna wait until they worked all the bugs out, but I'm glad I didn't. This game is absolutely fantastic. Gripping, intense, badass, mysterious, deep, fresh, and an absolute blast to play.  Some people wanna trash it because it's not polished, but they're just being bitches. Thank you CDPR for giving us this amazing work of art, and a game I'm sure to be playing for at least the next year or so."
1609824760,"despite all the bug i ran into while playing it had a great story and really loved the nomad ending it felt complete, all the action, side missions, all the characters you communicate with throughout the game was pretty awesome"
1609824751,120 Hours  in and WOW WOW WOW Well done CD Projekt  U did it again man u guys Rock God bless man
1609824687,"Kinda buggy but a fantastic RPG. Reminded me a lot of Fallout New Vegas: an engaging story, varied gameplay, and an immersive world. This is a game that you can sink thousands of hours in to and you'll still find enjoyment."
1609824647,"Honestly going into this game not trying too hard to listen to criticism because of the bugs and shit, forming an opinion myself i say this is gonna be my favorite game for a long long long time! If your a fan of the FallOut games and Borderlands, and games alike this game will take you by the hand and make sweet cybernetic love to you. Combat is amazing, character developement is flawless, story is crazy, and all of this entire game is badass. overall 10/10 idgaf bout the glitches and stuff games fine and only has one place to go and that's the big leagues baby!"
1609824556,swindled by the polish again
1609824479,"This game is straight trash and over-hyped af. It's beyond buggier than any game I've ever played with not only visual but audio glitches, it's a total eye soar and looks like it was made in 2009, and the mechanics are stiff as hell and is overall a very boring game. There's little to no customization as they made it seem it would be. I thought it would be on the customization level skyrim was on but it's no where near that. Even Call of Duty has more customization and that's such a detail less game yet i still have fun playing it more than this pile of shit."
1609824224,fun
1609824188,"couple visual glitches but thats all, nothing that broke the game or anything, its a great game imo"
1609824027,Good
1609823876,"It's rather hard maybe if you have a decent or good computer rig sure with little bug nothing too serious but for a potato computer that's a big no-no. All in all, it's a good game for the next-gen game."
1609823825,haha bugs go brrrr
1609823675,"While the game might not have lived up to the expectations that was hyped up to be, in its current state it is still a very enjoyable experience. Thankfully this is the PC release and not the console release of the game and I might have had a completely different experience. 

In my time with the game, I only encountered one game breaking bug that caused me to reload a previous save and that only cost me a few minutes and I ended up playing out the scenerio slightly different anyway. 
That was encountered before the first major patch for the game and I was impressed with the quick work the team has/have been making on the game.

I look forward to seeing the future content and what will become of the game. I am already looking forward to starting my 2nd playthrough."
1609823606,Big peepee
1609823537,"Completed the story after 70 ish hours. Yeah there's a lot to do, if you can get it to run .,"
1609823511,"Rode a roller coaster with Keanu Reeves. It is the only time I ever saw him smile in the whole game.

I only recommend this game if you've got the recommended hardware specs or better; my set-up barely squeaks out the minimums but still needs some ""outside of game"" fiddling (through Nvidia Control Panel, in my case) so the default graphic settings don't cause a crash before the splash-screen can be reached. 

Things I dislike;
While many choices in dialog/player activity can change outcomes for SOME Side Gigs, CDPR seem to have abandoned the depth of consequences we've seen in Witcher 1&2. In-Mission choices boil down ""Do the Optional Objective, or don't."" This is probably more because of open-world design, but there's really not a lot of ""choice and consequence"" in comparison to CDPR's previous works. Dialog choices serve role-play and not much more. Yes, saying the right things can net you occasional rewards, but 95% of them are just for your V's flavor. Think Fallout 4's dialog choices, but with better writing and VO. Essentially, you can choose whatever you please all the way up to the warning-flagged ""Point-of-No-Return"" and your ending will be unaffected. The only things that change are dependent on your completion of side-quests involving main characters; complete Panam's and Rogue's side-quests and you've got every ending available to choose from, after the PNR. It is, sadly, ""The Ending-Tron 3000 Ver 2.0"". A far cry from Witcher 2's ""Iorveth's Path vs Roche's Path"", where the whole game is constantly reacting to you from the very beginning, all the way to the end. In relation, V's ""life-path"" (Nomad/Streetkid/Corpo) also feels more like a role-play choice than anything else. The unique dialogs you get for each path just serve as a way for V to have pre-existing knowledge about certain things in dialog, and very rarely have any gameplay impact (a Corpo V may be able to distract a receptionist, while Nomad V may be more understanding of Panam's situation). I definitely appreciate my character being given context in a sort-of origin story, but it's so rarely implemented as an advantage that it's kind of rendered moot once the intro missions are over.

Things I like;
The RPG system is just as deep as it needs to be; not SO deep that it overwhelms every aspect of gameplay (i.e., you can use any weapon you like with relative ease, but you can improve them by sinking Perk Points into their respective skill tree; you're not ""bad until you're good"" like, say, the first Deus Ex), but just deep enough to make this more than just ""GTA in the WORLD OF TOMORROW!!!"". Characters are engaging, story is solid, Keanu may be dry like beef jerky in the Sahara but it fits his angsty rockerboy character just fine. The Quick-Hacks for combat and stealth are all pretty fun to use, though they break the game pretty hard once you have their best versions. But, that might be said for anything you double-down on (sink all of your points into Pistol skills and your revolvers can kill the bosses before needing to reload). There's still plenty to take you by surprise, though; I once tried to use the Gorilla Arms to punch a dude hiding behind a concrete parking barrier, but missed, and my cyber-fist crumbled the cement down to the rebar. I had to pause the game and contemplate what I've been doing to these people, knowing now that I can punch with the force of a jackhammer.

Overall, I think of this game as a mashup of Deus Ex: Human Revolution/Mankind Divided and the 3D Fallout games, with just a sprinkling of the good parts from Watch_Dogs. Also, I definitely recommend playing as a female V because her VO is engaging and full of personality without coming off as try-hard, while male V comes off as the same grisly, macho mf we've seen/heard 10000 times. Same scripts, but the female VO performance is better, imo (why does male V have a northeast US accent?! It's like a low-calorie Boston or NYC accent, but Night City is in SoCal!).

Final Verdict; We can't pet our cat (yet), and the game needs a lot of bug-fixes, so 7/10. If you're still undecided, wait a few months for the patches to roll in."
1609823402,"Bad game lots of bugs
Give primogem after bug fix pls"
1609823230,Bugs and glitches but still awesome and playable.
1609823845,"sux i can't run it on my pc with a 750ti with 4 gigs of on board ram, and an i4 cpu"
1609823011,buggy but fun
1609822997,"Bugs aren't that bad, idk I like it."
1609822972,This is a buggy nightmare and far from optimized for even PC atm. I'd wait on this and see if CDPR is busy keeping their promise of a well polished game...
1609822940,Its got some glitches but so far I haven't experienced any major game breaking glitches. I'm looking forward to future updates and especially multiplayer.
1609822769,"Plenty of fun, I was expecting a lot and feel satisfied. Its fun, you can play this and have fun. I'm hoping we see a sequel in less than 7 years that adds to this IP because the atmosphere is just freaking great. 
"
1609823067,"Boy is this a dilemma... In the end, I have to recommend it *But ONLY if (you have a good pc and/or) you're okay spending AAA price for an early access game, you'll have to be okay with *cut content, *bugs/glitches and *optimization issues. Otherwise I'd say wait about 6-12 months for the actual ""gold"" (PATCHED) version to be released. All in all I enjoyed my experience [72hr as of reveiw] (ryzen 7 3700 16gb ram rtx2060 very high=40-70fps rtx off)"
1609822437,"It was honestly disappointing, bugs and glitches aside, the games story is not great and if you just to the main quest it feels like you did not really play a full game at all, I did most the side quest and still fill like I didn't play much of a game. Feel like it was a lot less then there should have been for a game that was supposed to be large. I do not recommend it with bugs and the story most of all. If you want to play it just wait till a sale you won't be missing much."
1609822380,"Had a great time playing it. It's an amazing game, even for all it's faults.

Story is wonderful, great writing and powerful acting across the board. Of course, I'm not including the stuntman and motorcycle salesman that voices Johnny in that. Graphics are impressive even on a mediocre pc. Part of that is the art direction - feels like there was a cinematographer involved. Gameplay (combat, gunplay, etc) feels good. Driving enthusiasts will hate driving, but I quite liked it because it kind of forces you to slow down and take in the environment.

What's missing: the thing's literally unfinished, and it's pretty obvious. It gives a clue to what might be in store for future updates. There are two Perks (character skills to acquire) that have no practical purpose in the game. You can easily finish the story and most of the side missions by the time you're halfway to max character level. You're basically a god by level 30 (and done with the main and side missions) so you gotta wonder what kind of content was meant for characters levels 30-50. Maybe we'll get an Act II and Act III.

The elephant in the room: the bugs. My playthrough was mostly bug-free, and most of what I encountered was minor. In about 100 hours it crashed once and I reloaded from the most recent autosave 4 or 5 times to clear some trivial issue like a UI element that's glitched. If you can laugh off a little glitch now and then you'll be fine.

Keep an eye on this. I'd recommend it now, but CDPR *could* turn this into an absolute clutch for 2021 GOTY."
1609822276,my character has both male and female genitalia
1609822232,"Don't get me wrong, the story this game had to offer was great. And wouldn't expect anything less from a AAA game and cd project. But if you're thinking about buying its wise to wait for updates to fix the game. I got a strong pc and can run the game on ultra with 65 frames per second, and still experience a lot of bugs. One was even game breaking, takemura glitched out and wouldn't call me after a day of waiting. I had to re do 4 hours of gameplay thanks to the shit programming this game has. The last mission was even a bug fest. It's a damn shame this game had a lot of potential, but the bugs ruined a lot of the experience for me. I can't even imagine what console players are dealing with on old gen. That being said, wait before you buy they will polish with updates. I give its current state a 6/10, if there were no bugs it would a 8/10 9/10 easy. Great story, interesting characters, and Keanu Reeves killed his role for Johnny."
1609822184,its fun
1609822172,its got some bugs but the story is down
1609821911,trash
1609821808,"Oh boy, here we go. 

Current hardware status: 1060 3gb, 6 year old rig. 1440p benq

Actual hours played according to game save: ~95 completed near 100% playthrough (as far as I've found), ~8 fresh very hard playthrough (steam inflated this because I left my game running a couple nights)

This game was a trip. No spoilers until I talk about gameplay (if that's even a spoiler.)

Performance wise, I had no substantial issues. I had one Side Gig break beyond repair. I played on high/medium (starting on medium and eventually switching to high with no huge downgrade in playability) and enjoyed the quality of the game. Minor gripes with how things spawn in. Sometimes I would be driving and then stop and things would spawn under me. Either another car or a person, both of which would affect my game. Blocky and low res character models didn't bother me too much, they never really affected characters and portions of the game I truly cared about. 

Portions of the game I truly cared about: World, atmosphere, story. The world felt so colorful. There was a lot to fill, meaning there was a moderate amount of repetition and reuse, but that's not entirely bad. Go watch regular cable TV for an hour and you'll see the same 5 advertisements 36 times. It's part of the aesthetic in some ways, although not entirely forgivable. Every time I listened to or watched a news broadcast I wanted more of my character's actions reported. I know it's a huge city and we probably don't have that huge of an impact, but it would make the players' choices and actions more impactful on their scope of the setting if that was there. The framework is already implemented, we just need the content. 

In terms of atmosphere we’ve got all of the ideal cyberpunk tropes: impmats, cyborgs, virtual and augmented reality, hyper overpopulated cities, the ‘outcasts’ from said city, loads of espionage and intrigue, rogue and learning AI, hacking of all varieties, entire people stuck in computer chips or on the web, interesting challenges on identity and culture, one of the best representations of a trans person IN MEDIA PERIOD to this date, smart guns and most of the shit you dream you could stick into your arms to make you cooler. Cyberpunk 2077 has the grooves and sustenance to get you going and keep you wishing for more of the setting. Also, as usual, the music director overthere needs a flippin pay raise. That whole list is only the actual things in the game, the art and all is aside from that. It's all great… but that music… immaculate. I didn't ever think about what ‘cyberpunk jazz’ was, nor did i ask for it. However, now I never want it to leave my life. 

Alright, so how do I feel about what actually happened in terms of the plot? ...Pretty good. It's got the plot vacuum that a lot of these big RPG games wind up in. We start the story with “whoah, holey moley we got this crazy thing I have to do otherwise BAD things!” and then you get dumped into an immersive world filled with color and places to see, people to talk to, map markers to remove, and chicks in leopard print that make you ask yourself “is it worth 100 creds?” So some of the urgency gets melded and dwindled some. Does that take away from the plot in my opinion? NO! I greatly enjoyed the additional exposure to the world and the character that you spend a lot of the game with. This time spent in the game GREATLY altered my choice in the end. (Center of the solar system) I liked my options and I felt as though I could play in a way that my character wanted to. 

*GAMEPLAY ALERT*

I find this to be secretly one of the best parts of the game. So the people who made this also made another game before. In that game, you are always the same guy, who's the same person, who uses the same weapons and has access to the same spells. HOWEVER, there were loads of options on how you actually wanted to play your game. Altering your attacks, weapons, spells, even your physical person to achieve your desired path in combat. I find that a lot of this design concept wound its way into this game. There are a lot of options. So, in a world filled with wall piercing revolvers and homing submachine guns, anti-material rifles, whips and blades sprouting from your hands, and a megaman blaster I decided that I wanted to… punch people. Boy howdy… did I punch people. I adored this game's combat and stealth systems. Sure, there is a very old school and ‘dated’ sense to this game's stealth. Does that mean it's bad? That it’s poorly implemented? Maybe, but that's now how I felt. I had a blast working through encounters in whatever way I pleased. Taking the low route and eliminating enemies one by one and hacking along the way, or clenching those meat mallets and running in knuckles first to show those thugs what real ‘Street Brawling’ is all about. Currently I am doing a very hard handguns run, where I seek to be John Wick. It's rough going right now, but I'll figure these guns out after ~95 hours of steak slappers and get on the way with the right implats. Maybe i'll update this after this playthrough on my new rig. 

Still here? Well, I'm surprised. I'm not here to tell you if this game is for you or not. All I want you to know is that I had a heckin good time, and I want everyone else who plays this, or doesnt, to have one too. I wish that everyone could have had the best time with this game, but sadly not all of us did. However, I won't let that take anything away from me or my 60 creds. On that note, I would say that it's worth the 100.

I love this game, and I hope you can too.

1609821791,very nice
1609821575,Simultaneously a huge disappointment and one of the best games of 2020.
1609821547,"Obviously there are still some bugs and glitches, but my experience so far after 16 plus hours hasn't been bad. Haven't had any gamebreaking experiences so far. If only the console users fared so well...

Pros:

- Beautiful and interesting world
- Decent variety of weapons
- Plenty to do to keep you occupied when you aren't going through the story missions, keeps things interesting and my ADD at bay
- Runs surprisingly well on my GTX 1660 (running 1920x1080, definitely not a 4K ready card)

Cons:

- MC doesn't feel very deep backstory-wise (maybe I just haven't gotten to it all yet)
- Not a whole lot of need for a lot of the perks
- The whole ""netrunning"" system and hacking and whatnot is really a non-essential, would have liked to see more use for it and a little more in depth than simply ""hack this, turn that off, distract enemies with this"" (again, maybe I just haven't gotten to the good stuff yet)
- A few framerate slips when entering combat or heavy populated areas

Overall:

A fun and beautiful game with plenty to keep you occupied - 7/10"
1609821533,"great game, still needs a bit of time and patch work but i recommend"
1609821475,"Yes there are a few bugs and glitches, but this game pulls me in to the world and story unlike any game I have ever played. It feels like a true RPG and I have enjoyed every minute of it!"
1609821207,"very engaging, not as bad as people say, at least on the pc version"
1609821111,GAME IT SELF IS GD DESPITE THE BUGS.yes devs removed those promised feature  in the traier bt still its gd to go.visually stunning
1609821037,"I don't do many of these, so I'll try for the sake of brevity to summarize my time with this game and give a couple recommendations.

The PC version ran stable on high settings on the Alienware Aurora (2019 version) and didn't have many crashes (only happened two or three times for me, usually trying to enter photo mode), though the game definitely could stand to be optimized for performance improvements on a range of machines.

The bugs have been talked about ad nauseum, suffice to say they are there, they are ubiquitous, and most of the time mild annoyances.  Few I encountered stopped my quest and in those cases, usually reloading a save and replaying the portion with the issue cleared it up.

I personally loved the world, the storylines, the characters, and the variety of quests.  I marveled at how I could play this game for hours, not using my weapons, and still be thoroughly entertained.  This was one of the first games in an extremely long time that, as soon as I beat it, I instantly restarted a new game.

It was also the first game that I've played in a long time that made me want to do literally dozens of hours of side quests so that I wouldn't have to do the final mission and finish the game.

Those should be testaments to how good this game is, story-wise, even with the technical glitches and issues.  I think with a few patches, DLCS, and touches, this game will be a GTA5-type legend.

Some ideas:

1. Body Types and Aesthetic Options - Night City is about being anyone you want and dreaming any dream; why do we not have more body type options?  You see them permeate the city and V can be customized in a variety of ways but not when it comes to the body shape.  I know this is not a high priority, but a humble request.  It's a roleplaying game, let us role play like in Saint's Row: body types, more hairstyles, more beard types, etc.

2. More Clothes and Guns; please some type of transmog - Please!  I'm tired of my V looking like a party clown for good stats :'(

3. Simpler Menus - Please!!!!!

I'd give this game a 9.5/10 and highly recommend it, as long as you can overlook technical bugs and some crashes.  See you in Night City, choom!



"
1609821030,"Completed twice (Hard and Very Hard) with Corpo and Nomad background with two totally different builds.

Liked: Content (Story), Variety Quests, Gameplay, Freedom of Builds. 
Disliked: Bugs!!!! 

To be absolutely honest, this is a good game. For a gamer like me, who doesn't worry a whole lot about graphics (not that this looks any bad), this game has good content/story, ran great on my card with a constant 60+ FPS on high settings. The main quests and side quests are fun and engaging with good replay value (mainly due to builds).

However, I can totally understand the frustrations of people who cannot run this game or have bad performance from it. Even when it runs well, it's not the most beautiful game I have played. And the biggest issue is the tons of BUGS. When I say TONS, I mean it. Some are actually quite frustrating as it won't let you progress in a particular quest, cause issues requiring you to reboot / reload the game. Hopefully CD Project Red can polish this and also provide some good DLC content in the future. 

I still recommend at least one playthrough of this game if you can run the game well. You will enjoy it."
1609821018,"Describe this game in one word and it's ""Fun"". Sure, there's plenty of bugs, but the storyline is excellent, gameplay as addicting (there's a LOT to learn), and the characters are very immersive (it's all voice acted, there's no dialogue to read).

Just get it if your PC can handle it. You'll enjoy it now, and you'll enjoy it more even later when new content is added or fixed."
1609821012,"Great game that could have used another 12 months 'in the oven'. It is rough around some of its edges and really polished on some others. Hopefully in the future we will see some major patches. That said, I have already spend about 40 hours on this game and for the characters and story alone I feel like it deserves the recommendation. If you are on the fence, wait a bit and buy the 'enhanced' edition down the line"
1609820981,"""Night City is a city of dreams, and I'm a big dreamer.""

Phenomenal story but some parts fall a bit short. 
Night City is just a facade- pretty on the outside, empty on the inside...
I've also become a victim of spamming interact while looking at the ground for loot. I guess that's a side-effect of loot systems like this.
Rest in peace all the advertised content that never made it into the game (looking at you wall hanging with mantis blades).
Bugs, bugs, bugs. A healthy dose of T-Posing NPCs, random deaths from falling/vaulting, etc.

At the end of the game, I could get enemies to commit suicide with basically no cooldown for 1 RAM each as well as clear entire areas by running around with a machete and donking them in the head while slowing down time.

In the end, I liked it. Give it a few months for them to actually release the game :)"
1609820916,It's pretty fun. Get the Cyber Engine Tweaks on Nexus; it is incredibly helpful.
1609820911,"Although I have mixed feelings, my overall recommendation would be play it... BUT! its not the return of Jesus made game, it has a LOT of issues  that I will try to go in a bit more detail, but taking in account: price, quality of story and overall playability, it's a really good game.

First of all, Storytelling: 
the story is great, I'd say is the main reason people play it and why I give this game a thumbs up´. Most of us, who preordered, knew CDPR because we played The Witcher 3. And that gem was top 5 of the best games ever. (my opinion) so OF COURSE we came with really high expectations, and Cyperpunk 2077 delivered a really good story with a great world arround that story. bugs asside, I was completely immersed in this world: society, neigbnorhoods, advetisment, side quests, etc. everythings plays along and give a solid world. And the main storyline is really interesting too.
What I think is not that good in storytelling? The main story tryes to tell you to hurry because your life depends on you finding a solution quickly... but the game doesn't give a ****. You can go arround, completing side quest, fistfighting, streetracing like you have all the time in the world and the game doesnt do anything to punish you for doing that... So  it is hard to believe the game when it tells you to hurry.

Fighting system: 
You like FPS? good, you like slashers? good, you like magic system/hacking? good, you have skiltrees for each one fo those playstyles. and that's great. Makes the game interesting for a wider spectrum of players. Adn if you start gettin bored of shooting all the time, then maybe try grabbing a sword and start slicing and dicing some foes, or invest in some hacking devices. 
That aside Id say the game is easy. At first you'll have to get used to covering and sneaking, but when you get used to it, the game turns really easy, not much of a challenge if you add to that legendary equipment you start finding later in the game. And I think the main cause fo that is the lack of variety. In witcher you had a great variety of monsters, each one with a different fighting style and weaknesses and strengths... but here you have regular shooting guys, guys who think they can reach you and meele you, and hackers, that are more anoyng  than dangerous... all of them die in the same way: headshots or constant damage...Ow and also drones and mechs... which are THE different thing... and are really easy too. This is what is making the game, for me, a bit repetitive... I'd loved if Tigerclaws were 80% meele and a couple shooters, or the Animals to be like a stampede of muscle charging you. Some gangs weaker to fire because of their clothing... strategy like that... but they are all simple humans with gadgets and that makes is a bit boring in the long run.
CDPR, if you are listening please give clothing pros and cons, or at least each faction  so we can prepare and plan ahead the best way to take down each encounter... and not just throw flashbangs and headshot everyone or fry their brains.... (I can only wish XD)

Finaly, and what is the worst in the game, the AI... cops are stupid or fuc**** ninjas... the same as the wanted system... it might as well not exist, it's more anoying that usefull or dangerous... you can kill a civilian in the middle of the desert and a platoon will spawn from under a rock, but drive a couple of blocks away, and they all stop searching.
Drivers in night city are all turtles and/or stupid... comparisons with GTA are everywhere, so I won't get into that. pedestrians are deaf and blind, only notice you when you run voer them, the loudest horn wn't make them bat an eye.
and driving... it's so hard... I'd understand if there was no penalty for runing over one guy turning round the corner, by accident...but as soon you hit someone the ninja cops apear and there you have tu run again....
These small issues do ruin the experience a bit.

So there it is... The game is fun. Is a good game worth it's price, with a great story, great characters and great narrative overall. But is lacking polish in the fighting system and AI
IF you wanted the perfect game CDPR promised, with the city for you to conquer, where you could romance everyone, with an actual Wanted system... then keep waiting/searching"
1609820876,"Despite the bugs, I really enjoy playing this game. For me, this is one of the few games I have played that side missions actually mean something. The main story is definitely a grind."
1609820802,"I'd love to suffer through a second playthrough of this game, because I think it's great, but I dunno if I wan't to experience talking to Keanu Reeves while some fuckwit behind him shags a car mid conversation, dies, and then have the police beat me harder than I beat my own Schmeat because of it, again."
1609820761,"Great story line. Game engine still needs a little tweaking (e.g. looses NPC character speech and vehicle sounds randomly, some items unable to be picked up - Saburo Arasaka's Diary for instance) but overall quite enjoyable."
1609820707,"The game's alright. get it on sale, or maybe not, It does the witcher 3 no justice however, disappointing.
I'm just saying it gets really repetitive after some time."
1609820624,"There's a lot to like about this game: the graphics are gorgeous, the world is huge, and the theme is cool.

Unfortunately this is marred by weird bugs that persist after the latest patches, lack of feeling connected to the world, and realistically the biggest problem for me: it isn't a good RPG and it isn't a good FPS.

Deus Ex does a much better job at both, which is really disappointing!"
1609820255,Immerse yourself. You won't regret it.
1609820202,I put 80 hours in the first week. I had a blast and it'll only get better with upcoming dlc.
1609820192,very good
1609820185,"I really liked this game for the first 60 hours, but I'm a slow learner and I tend to plod through games.  One of the the best things about CP2077 is that there is not a lot of farming.  Some, but not much.  

What there is, and what really killed the game for me, were the bugs.  Especially when suddenly my arms don't work anymore due to an upgrade that can't be removed, and that I can't even escape by loading a save point prior to my surgery.  

Buy this game.  In a year or two, when they fix the bugs... if they fix the bugs."
1609820082,"Great game, quests, atmosphere, some bug/glitches but not bad and will be addressed as more patched roll out. Best AA game i have played this year. 2080 ti and 9900k @ 5.1ghz"
1609820040,The game is good
1609819906,its pretty good
1609819859,"Everyone only talks about bugs, optimization and stuff... They'll fix it.
But really, here’s the best game I’ve ever played."
1609819816,"Visually stunning, great voice acting. A few bugs, but nothing game-breaking."
1609819799,"The game is a little buggy at times, but honestly the gameplay and story make up for it. That, and the sheer amount of world building, both in terms of writing and environment, make the number of bugs understandable.

The Bugs are more like Skyrim really. There's a lot, mostly visual, but they kind of have a hilarious charm. Some of the best moments of this game are when something just doesn't quite work right and you see the after effects of that.

Like when a Bike decided to spawn inside a Car, the physics freaked out, and I almost got sideswiped by a Bike to the face.
Or when Jackie is eating noodles, and suddenly he has quantum chopsticks.
Or towards the end with Silverhand sliding in the sitting position in the elevator.

You can really get immersed and actually roleplay in this game. Which is where you get the most value out of it. Some V's will have entire character arcs and become totally different people towards the end.

All that said. The best part of this game?
Going on a rollercoaster with Keanu Reeves.
10/10 Breathtaking and you can't change my mind."
1609819698,Pretty good                                                                                                                                                                                                            Panam is dummy thicc
1609819691,Haven't been able to stop playing. Great game with a great deal of detail!
1609819564,Whatever you do stay far away from this terrible game!!!!
1609819529,"It's a buggy mess, At times civis won't load in properly, your car will get stuck in buildings, and NPC's will run on mass when you pull your car up on the curb. Despite all this it is a very fun game with an engaging story and riviting characters."
1609819412,"Not as glitchy as I thought it would be.  Still not as polished as I would have liked it, but still a great game overall!  I love it!"
1609819412,Poot....
1609819336,"i like ending. space one is cool, didnt get 2 play in soace tho 0/10 would not spacew agane
8/10 rest of gaem"
1609819321,"While all the stories about large amount of bugs and graphics errors are true a lot of them don't take away from the story or the game play very much though it can get a little annoying at times. Even with all the bugs there is still a lot of content in this game, the combat system is really fun and you can make so many builds with guns and cybernetic parts. The story is super fun with some of the characters being my favorites from any other game. This game is super fun with a great story, even with all the bugs its still a great game to play."
1609819300,i liked everything once they get the bugs fixed id say the game would be a 10 for me
1609819250,"Recommend...with a few exceptions. 
1. Highly demanding on system. - If your current hardware only meets minimum game system requirements, or only meets some of the recommended hardware, Do Not Buy. I am fortunate enough to have a system capable, thus I had very few issues, HOWEVER- trying to run this game on my old system with minimum hardware was an ABSOLUTE TRAINWRECK.
2. Alot seems missing- Every so often while playing I would simply stop and be like "" Wow, this would be been so cool if...."".  Understand going into this game that clearly there is so many missing features in this game the CDPR could probably make a game on the missing features alone.
All in all, after finishing my first play through I can honestly say I enjoyed my experience. However, I must say alot of that enjoyment came simply from the Cyber Punk style. This game is absolutely no where near perfect or even what I imagine most people would consider a complete game. If you have the PC to run it on higher settings and can you accept the fact you are buying an unfinished game you should be able to get your money's worth outta this title."
1609819235,"While it may have its issues, if you have the hardware to run it well it's an incredible experience."
1609819149,good
1609819326,"Short answer: Its a fun game with a lot of things to do BUT a lot of things need to be polished.

Long answer: Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that I very much enjoyed. From the story to the minor details of the open world. Main quests, Side quests, and even the NCPD jobs keep you engaged and attached to the multiple of characters you meet in the way. It is not hard to get lost in the game and immerse yourself in this awesome open world. Keanu Reeves has done an amazing part as Johnny Silverhand and the rest of the voice actors did an amazingly good job as well. Having said that there are many things still wrong with the game. Although I have never experienced any crashes during my play through(Im running a r5 2600x & rtx 2060) there have been a lot of bugs that just ruin your immersion of the game. Imagine you see your choom dying by your side then suddenly a random bug happens, welp there goes my my immersion. Its pretty sad because Night City is such a beautiful open world with a ton to do in it. Customization in the game is almost non existent. I mean you cant even get a haircut... I also suggest not getting a long beard because during cinematics the beard clips through your collar. The genital customization is just a gimmick with no real use. AI, to say the least, are very dumb and lack coding to actually think for themselves. If you park a motorcycle slightly on the road they dont even try to move forward which causes traffic in game(I experience traffic irl already). If you shoot your gun to ground the AI do this weird simultaneous action that just looks so robotic. Their police system is just plain dumb and lazy and their crafting system is pretty weak. 

I know it seems ive just listed a lot of complaints but I honestly love this game and it might actually crack my top 10. Its just sad to see that a lot of these issues could have been fixed. I still have high hopes for this game <3"
1609819077,"First - Whether rng or setup, I didn't experience many of the horrific bugs this game does in fact have that others have experienced. So YMMV.

Outside of that, I really enjoy this game. I've been craving a 'choices matter' style rpg, and this is a massive throwback for me to the likes of the KOTOR series and early Mass Effects, with a hint of GTA. Between dialogue and build options, just taking a drive around the city and soaking in the atmosphere, and the crazy amount of minor detail that will probably go unnoticed by many. Things like getting an additional option to skip a fight if you did a specific side quest, by referencing it, or seemingly unique side conversations unimportant npcs have in certain areas."
1609819031,"[b] This game is an uncut diamond of immense proprtions. Amazing characters, fantastic stories, breathtaking world, engaging gameplay with a lot of options for different builds and so much more awesome stuff. 

As soon as this game recieves some more sanding and polishing it will be brilliant shining diamond. [/b]

To put it simple: I loved my time with this game. ~95h in I finished the story once and am currently finishing up all the side missions and police objective. Yes the game has some bugs. Although they are blown way out of proportion by the internet and media. I can't speak for Consoles but for me on my medium class pc (RTX 2060, Ryzen 7 2700x) I was playing on 1440p with mostly medium/high settings using DLSS quality with an average of 60-80fps depending on the place. 
I barely had any serious issues. 

Most bugs I had were minor visual glitches like floating objects or funky foliage. The ""worst"" bug I expirienced probably had to be that sometimes some UI elements or sounds got stuck on screen. Although they were very easily fixable by saving and reloading. I also once had a character get stuck in the phone screen and appear in all conversations. It was more funny/wierd than a serious problem and it solved itself once I finished his questline. I also had 2 crashes in total... a lot, right?

So to sum it up, Cyberpunk 2077 is an amazing, story and character driven RPG with good gameplay and a visual marvel of a world, that is currently a bit rough arround the edges, but is getting progressivly better with each patch releasing."
1609818955,"Only if you have a SCREAMING PC.  Otherwise, make CDPR earn your money."
1609818864,AAA+++
1609818755,"In pc the game is great, at least for me it was. I've seen videos on youtube about bunch of glitches and bugs but i kinda got lucky and not experience that many bugs and with the hotfix they are giving its fixing lots of it now."
1609818684,PREEM.
1609818650,"Is it buggy? Yes.
Runs like crap? Yes.
Does it have a story that will change your life? No.
Does the UI kinda suck? Yes.
Do I have any idea what 2500+ armour means? Heck no!

But what this game has is solid gunplay, some incredible moments of storytelling, and a cool world that I couldn't help but be pulled into. If you want to wait for it to be fixed up and go on sale, I say go right ahead. But if you want to dive in and keep your expectations in check (it's just a good game, not life-changing) then I think you'll enjoy yourself. I've completed the main story line, done as many side missions as possible, and just had a good time."
1609818604,This game has way too much going on. It's a buggy disaster. There's great stuff there too but it needs like another year of development.
1609818555,Warts and all I really love this game.
1609818533,it's beautiful!!
1609818480,despite the bumps. game is great!!
1609818442,BEST. GAME. EVER.
1609818423,it smells like cheese but it tastes like cheese
1609818421,very good
1609818418,"Realistically this game was never going to live up to everyone's overhyped expectations. There was bound to be some people who would be disappointed. Having said that, there is a lot of things in this game that are missing or unfinished. Factions and gangs feel hollow, there are an incredible amount of bugs that range from immersion breaking to game breaking, gameplay elements that were shown in E3 demos have been cut, and dozens of systems like AI, police, crafting, and looting are broken and unfinished. Beyond the stuff that cannot be patched or added onto, the main story feels rushed and chopped up, likely due to many last minute cuts. 

This has lead me to the conclusion that this game is very disappointing, and despite my own hype for it to come out I really do wish in hindsight that Cyberpunk was delayed another year or 2 back before April. It's disappointing to know that the devs tried their hardest to produce something exceptional and the problems with this game were entirely on the upper management. CDPR lied to the public about the state of the game, rushed the project, and crunched their devs. 

What makes the feeling of disappointment even more strong is the fact that despite everything I've said about the game, it's really good, and I do recommend you play it. The world, the sound design, the voice acting, and the characters are all doing so much heavily lifting for this incredibly flawed game. It really fucking bums me out to think of the kind of game we would have gotten if CDPR stuck with that philosophy of ""Coming when it's ready.""

Instead we got this. An incredibly buggy, unfinished mess that still overcomes those flaws and manages to deliver a fun open world experience. Its really a shame CDPR didn't go for the next generation of open world games that they were promising."
1609818360,"I want so very badly to say ""Yes I'd recommend"" but it's not worth it yet. It's pretty rough around the corners.  It's small things that add up and really break immersion. If this game gets rounded out, it'll be worth a buy then."
1609818323,"Bugz, bugz and bugz. So what. The game is awe inspiring. Hell yes it should have taken another year to polish. But all you gamers were crying when they announced delays. This is what crying gets you. Man up and enjoy this amazing title."
1609818189,Could it be better? Yup. Am I having fun with it? Yeah
1609818099,is good
1609818092,cyberpunk
1609818040,"this is good
i like it
you should two"
1609817950,"Holy fucking shit, the story."
1609817776,"Admittedly there are a lot of bugs in the game, some are game breaking. If you can get past this the game is incredible. There are tons of quests and they are putting out patches to try and get the game back on track. At 200 hrs. it looks like I am a little over half way through the side quests. I have beat the game once but there are a few other options I would like to try."
1609817700,"The game design is beautiful. It plays well and there are so many ways to play the game, from all out massacre to not killing anyone to a cyber ninja. Very open. The missions are fun and creative with some very funny, weird and infrequently dark moments.
A few issues I've found and these aren't the generic, easy pop issues many people ridicule the game about. They are:
- Police don't drive cars, ever. Also the police spawn behind you often rather than any real way of trying to apprehend you.
- NPC's are still just single dialogue NPC's as opposed to what was offered to us. They don't feel anymore natural than GTA or Witcher 3.
- The opening life path that you choose has little to no bearings on how the game is played.
- Still some minor bugs, that I'm sure will be ironed out, including, a glitch that disables running after exiting a car and just general lack of NPC AI. If you park a car in the road, the NPC's in cars won't drive around it, or problem solve.

All in all a very good game in itself. A far cry from what was promised but I'm still loving it, it's easter eggs, it's secrets references to other games."
1609817828,"this game fuckin' sucks.
who cares about bugs, the story and script suck. most of the dialogue comes off as ESL instead of ""casual."" after 15-20 hours on normal you'll probably be so powerful that the narrative no longer makes sense, especially during the end of the main story. i'm sure if you play 80 hours instead of 40 you'll get a slightly satisfactory ending though."
1609817505,"Your decisions do not matter
You have no impact on the world
Any ""choices"" you make are an illusion
The AI is severely broken
The police in the game may as well not exist since after the first half dozen or so appear out of thin air are dispatched, they will no longer spawn.
The gangs play absolutely zero part in the game aside from a handful of references.
That game has had more content cut from it than the content it actually shipped with.
Crashes are almost inevitable, especially if you doing anything even remotely not in line with what a person would normally do, and this is on a high end rig.
Stealth is completely broken and borderline pointless
Driving feels horrible and theirs zero customization available and beyond that, apparently every car in 2077 shipped with a transmission with a slipping clutch.
Its not an RPG, although you may have noticed they last minute changed that advertising to ""action adventure""

Silver-lining:
The gun play is decent
Quickhacking is a fun and unique experience although its completely broken after maxing
Graphics are absolutely stunning
Theirs enough side jobs and gigs to keep you occupied for well over 100 hours, generally unique enough to keep you interested in completing them all
World design is fantastic

Its fairly fun if you take it at face value: A first person open world action shooter with a ton side activities and unique combat gimmicks. That, however, doesnt discount the state this game was released in, or the sheer lack of promises the game connected on."
1609817495,Great game overall kinda buggy but worth the time
1609817488,"Alright so obviously this game has a lot of pros and cons but I'm gonna try and stay positive for this review. My honest opinion is that this is a great game when it comes to the story, I've always loved CDPR's story telling with the Witcher trilogy and I was not disappointed with CB77. Now disregarding the story, this game is decent overall I'd say, the leveling up system is fun and the cyberware installations are really fun to buy and use and can help you with combat. But the gun game-play for sure feels a little stiff compared to other FPS. HOWEVER, I feel that we should cut CDPR some slack since this is their very first time dealing with guns and a FPS since the Witcher games' focused mainly on swords with a few exceptions. The driving mechanics also feel really stiff compared to other games but it got the job done, and again this is CDPR's first time experimenting with cars. I personally feel that people over hyped CB77 way too much, I mean I get it's CDPR and that they themselves slightly over hyped the game as well but people were treating the game like it was going to change gaming forever. Personally though, I did feel somewhat disappointed with CDPR's performance for this game since there's so many issues for a game that's been pushed back 3 times. So is it worth getting? It depends really. Overall, I'd say if you've got the money then I would for sure recommend it to anyone who's thinking of buying it. Overall ranking: 7/10 not what it was hyped up to be but it's still fun nonetheless."

1609817280,"Cyberpunk is the best solo player ever i have ever experienced, its a video game that takes the best of modern RPG, first-person shooter, stealth, and the open world and masterfully blends it into a single product. CD Projekt out done them-self in producing this amazing game."
1609817260,So far have not found any game breaking bugs.
1609817212,"Scummy business practices like review score based employee bonuses and not letting reviewers see the poorly optimized console versions combined with the massive amount of bugs just makes the game not worth it.

Good gameplay, but lacking the polish that any AAA game needs to be full priced"
1609817157,is guud
1609817099,Lots of detail to the game. Some minor bugs but overall great game.
1609816943,"Its a fantastic game. So many things to do and enjoy i dont know where to start with it. First off, this game isnt for the faint of heart. Lots of different elements in this game that you have to be ok seeing. But the game as a whole really does suck you in. The colors, the sounds, the vibes. All of it really pulls you in and leaves you wanting more. Secondly, the stories and lore. Man it is so deep. You could play for hours without progressing anywhere just reading and learning about all the lore of Night City. And its all so worth. So much developement and growth. 

      All in all a great game. I would 100% recommend this game to everyone, but unfortunately not everyone can play. Be warned that the bugs do make it difficult for some. Older gen consoles and pcs will struggle to run this game. I luckily have a relatively decent pc so i encountered minimal bugs(except for the strip club across from vickors shop). Most pcs can run this no problem. Heck even my four year old MSI laptop was able to run it, albeit with more bugs and the lowest settings possible, the little dinosaur that could was able to do it. So go ahead and try it out. IM SURE you will love it.
     And PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE stop giving hate to the devs. They work hard every day to make this game an enjoyment for all. This game was released too early in my opinion so give the devs a break when you encounter a bug or something that makes it unplayable. They work night and day to fix what doesnt work, so just sit tight and im sure youll be playing again in no time. 
     STAY SAFE AND HAVE FUN CHOOMS"
1609816867,"I recommend it.

Pros: I've played over 58 hours and counting. So far and I can't stop playing. The story is compelling and at the same time, the secondary missions and the character's sense of progress and its abilities are addictive. The city is really cool! driving is ok, main character movement is fun.

Cons: numerous bugs, very annoying, impossible not to notice, but they do not prevent you from having fun. The animations still require work, dialogues overlapping. I can't wait for updates from the developers.

1609816827,"Super full of lag, see tree all over the screen, death by 1 feet fall of just to run going down stair u can die. dont forget to save, every time you upgrade, craft. save again, because sudden death happen out of nowhere and you lose all your unsaved content. that frustating as the game look good but i suck not being able to enjoy it."
1609816709,"Simply put, it's a buggy mess but super fun if you can see past the imperfections. It doesn't do anything new or ground breaking but it does what it does well enough."
1609817446,"Ignore the moaning and complaining about this game. So glad I purchased this! Have only encountered a few minor graphical glitches throughout my 80 hours and I haven't had a single crash. For such an ambitious game with a huge, open world, and the best graphics I've seen in a game to date...I'd say that's pretty damn impressive. 

80 hours in and I'm not even close to the end of the game either. If you're like me and you have to collect every last item, check off every last map marker, do every last side quest etc. etc. etc. you will fall in love with Cyberpunk 2077 just like I did. I've barely scratched the surface of what there is to complete here and I can barely put the controller down once I start playing. 

The game world is huge, with lots of verticality and it's extremely stunning when you look up and notice how tiny you are compared to the towering skyscrapers. Lots of diverse locations throughout the city. The story so far is gripping, characters are amazing. Stellar acting jobs and you actually feel a connection to many of the main characters throughout. Combat is exhilarating, although at later levels you become a sort of walking tank if you focus on the crafting tree. Driving for the most part has been fixed since a few patches ago, which was my biggest gripe but isn't a problem anymore. The biggest let down for me was that you're not able to enter every building, but the world itself is so big that it's a minor complaint. 

I give Cyberpunk a 9/10 easily. Add this gem to your library ASAP...money well spent."
1609816636,"It needs at LEAST another 8 months but honestly probably another year in the oven. Wait then, get it on a discount and have it be a better, functional, optimized game. Win-win. If you need something like this now, try mankind divided."
1609816597,"Personally I experienced very minor bugs compared to what others have reported.
I think if you have the privilege of playing on a high end rig, then go for it.
It's a beautiful game, and if you go in without any crazy expectations it's a fun ride."
1609816553,game is too laggy and buggy
1609816258,"Pros
- great story telling
- fun combat with high variability
- short enough to finish without getting pulled out due to repetition and boredom
- easily replayable... but...

Cons
- not quite what was promised in early marketing
- replayable... but... not necessarily for the RPG side of things
- AI is pretty bad and can detract from combat substantially
- feels better when you pace yourself slowly and travel by foot/car

I mean I got more than 200 hours out of this and I can easily claim I enjoyed over 250 hours of it"
1609816154,"Would only really recommend this game if you have a fairly solid gaming pc.
If you do for example have like a 2080 super or higher you should have a solid experience.

Yes, game still has a fair number of glitches and bugs that range anywhere from annoying to hilarious.

FPS can swing from high 60+ fps in some areas to low 30s or even 20s depending on hardware and settings.

Is the game buggy and not very well optimized so far? 
(Absolutely! but if you have solid hardware and can crank those settings up without losing too many frames its one hell of a good time!)"
1609816123,"Just finished the game with all achievements which took me about 56 hours.

I enjoyed this game.  Sure, it was buggy as well with assets popping in and blowing other stuff sky high (which I actually found funny), items staying on screen when they should not, and so on.  I am running a pretty decent machine though (RTX 2060) so I did not have any game breaking bugs and had zero crashes.

The gameplay itself I found to be a blast.  I played with hacks, pistols, fists, blades, pretty well everything and enjoyed it all.  The city is fun to drive through with cool scenery and fun cars.

The main quests and side quests were all well done with interesting stories for the most part.

My one complaint would be that gigs and NCPD scanners quickly became dull.  Some were unique but most were pretty lame.  Especially when you compare to Witcher 3 which had unique main missions, side missions, and contracts.  It seemed like a surprisingly weak effort from a company known for not just copy/paste side missions.

All in all though, it was worth it.  I'll probably leave it alone for a while but come back for another run as the opposite gender with different romance and maxing the opposite attributes.  If you don't have a good machine though or can't stand ""cosmetic"" bugs, wait for a few more patches."
1609816030,"A little buggy, but an absolutely amazing game overall. I would definitely recommend buying it. The story line is amazing! I haven't beaten it yet, but I absolutely love it so far!"
1609815933,Flaming Crotch Man
1609815875,"TL;DR - This game has a very static world and gets boring quick. 

This game has a great environment (except I don't think seeing the same exact ads featuring butt cheeks and side breast all over the city is very immersive), but it's not a well structured RPG in terms of progression and challenge. I got really bored with it about 20 hours in, as the gameplay loops you can engage in are not very interesting. Most of the side stories are told through text conversations you find on dead enemies or in the environment, which is disappointing considering the Witcher 3 had fully voice acted side quests and many of them had choices as to how you could resolve them. There is only the choice of approach in Cyberpunk 2077, as you can navigate situations stealthily or just go in guns blazing. 
The NPC's are not interesting. They have no routines or homes. They just pop into existence around the player and say very bland or slightly offensive things. They don't really react to the player except to flee or take cover when gunfire happens or you jump on them.

In conclusion, you'd be better off spending your money on a Deus Ex game if you want the cyberpunk atmosphere or Oblivion/Skyrim/Fallout 3/NV/4/Kingdom Come Deliverance if you want a world that feels immersive and alive."
1609815752,"Cyberpunk 2077 is a very fun game to play and is extremely addicting. I've been sleeping a lot later than I usually do because I want to complete just one more side mission. The bugs & glitches sometimes take you out of the moment, especially when they happen during an important cut-scene or dialog. Also bummed that HDR is broken. Hoping all of this gets fixed with future patches."
1609815701,game is good
1609858575,"Look, I know what you may think. The game is buggy, some quests seem to have bee cut short, but the overall game is worth it. Many -if not all- sidequests were made with a lot of thought and sentiment behind it, and even some gigs (lower tier sidequest) were very creative. Moreover, the main quest's ending will let want to replay and see if you missed something. However, combat and overall world interactions -specially driving- is sometimes unfulfilling and maybe unrewarding for some. In hones sake, try it after January or late winter after several updates and the new upcoming DLC. Content Warning for all of you who have issues with trans representation, sexual imagery in general -specialy with marketing purpose-, and human sexual trafficking.

1609815587,"I never looked at any previews or read into the hype; so went in fairly blind.
Anyway I'm absolutely delighted with it. Most satisfying game I've played in a long time. Now I'm just working through all the side missions and continuing to explore the amazing city."
1609815409,"I liked the story and the relationships I built. It is still buggy but playable. I didn't run into any game breaking bugs, and I feel lucky because of that. After the bugs are situated, this will be one of the best games I played. I wish they played out special endings based on your initial story but with little details (like turning on the highbeams/turning off the lights) makes this one of the few games that has impressed me with its attention to details. I do however, have a couple gripes. They could have also built more endings based on who the player is on good terms with.I also feel like the romance in this story is sort of rushed and not really flushed out. I wish they would let me take them out on dates besides the one mission specific one. The last issue I have is the ending itself. I hope they let us explore what happens to our character after the final mission in future updates/DLC. It kind of ends on a whimper. I recommend this game only if you dont mind goofy bugs and are willing to put time into the game. 140hrs in and I still had some outstanding gigs."

1609815204,First off yes glitches. Second its missing a ton of content that was left out because of issues with release. But the game is over all enjoyable.
1609815181,This is an unfinished product with bad game design and tons of bugs. As of right now I would say it is an early access game at best.
1609815089,"Welcome to Night City where Gangs are cool and Morals are low. Over all rating 8/10, here's why, It has some audio and visual bugs from time to time but the over all story and Character development is solid. I only really started seeing loading/rendering issues towards the 45th hour. Audio issues are hit or miss and usually its combat music that is still playing when combat is over but can be fixed by loading a save. Currently I have around 50 hours in on my 1st play through and I will be doing at least 2 more to more to get the most out of this game.

The glitches almost make it even more fun.  The story is EVEN better. Just play it."
1609814850,"As most people at this point probably know, Cyberpunk 2077 had a launch from hell, being premature and buggy and nobody seemed to love it.
But I did. And I still do. It is a good game, even thought it had a really rough start, most of the sever bugs are now fixed and considering I'm on a GTX970 and i5-4690K with 24G of ram, it runs. Although I have everything down to minimum and the FPS drops below 30 at some points on 1080p with no downscaling,  it still manages to keep me drawn into it. Granted, I might be a fan of the genre, but the last game that managed to draw me in this hard that I can think of was Morrowind (and that was BEFORE modding it to hell and back).
So I guess, if you're a fan of the genre and have half-way decent hardware, you most likely will enjoy this one. I think after all is said and done, it is still worth the full price."

1609814347,"Cyberpunk 2077, the hype for this game was unmatched. Personally I chose to do my best to avoid and not buy in to the hype and I don't regret it one bit. This game may not be the life-changer it was talked up to be yet and to be honest, at the moment this game can be pretty damn buggy. Overall however, I love this game! The story so far has been amazing and I have been enticed by the world and amazing cast of characters. The voice acting feels very genuine and great and the world feels real, besides for the terrible bystander NPC AI right now. NPC AI in general is nothing to impressive, the citizens feel really lacking and pop in and out of render at times as well as traffic being outright stupid at times. There may be alot of glitches at the moment and I will have to continue when some of the new patches roll out. I'd reccomend waiting for the new patches if you have not bought the game already.

Honestly it's just not a good game; hell, arguably, it's not a game, yet. It was quite clear early on it would not be the game it was promised to be, but after completion, I've realized most of my choices don't really carry a lot of consequence, driving is just awful, audio design was clealrly not completed before launch and although the city is visually impressive, it just feels empty and the few activities in it become quickly redundant. AI is broken, in all levels (npc behaviour, npc driving, enemy combat AI, cops, etc), to the point that San Andreas had better AI at launch. I wanted to like this game, so bad, but it just sucks they released it in its current state. Some assets seem to remain that indicate the possibility of a comeback a'la No Man's Sky... one can only hope, but as it is, please don't pay full price for this. It is barely in Alpha."

"
1609813617,"A fantastic game.   Yes, bugs exist and we should expect better from a Triple A release; however, this game is a work of art that will only get better with each patch and DLC."
1609813461,"I am a huge Cyberpunk Fan. I have read Neuromancer and Snow Crash and many other genre classics, I have played through every Deus Ex game and Blade Runner is one of my favorite movies. The notion that I could walk the streets of Night City and experience something inspired by some of my favorite pieces of fiction was like a dream.

It is unfortunate that while the game is quite good, it is marred by several technical issues and design missteps that keep it from reaching that promise.

From the very beginning there are promises of great things. You go through a detailed character creation system that includes selecting a life path. The problem is these life paths are meaningless and only change the first 15 minutes of the game and a few rare dialog choices. Other games have done similar things before, Mass Effect had nearly an identical problem, you select a history that has little impact on the game, except there it was not touted as a huge game defining choice. It was hyped to such a degree that people were expecting something like the original Dragon Age which included an initial character choice that would define the first several hours of gameplay and hugely impact how the world and characters react to you. It feels like there was a ton of cut content around Life Path choice and the missed first year with Jackie, which is shown as a quick montage of hijinks. The problem is, that is the game I wanted to play. They skipped over the interesting part of the story.

With that said, the first few hours of the game are probably the high point. It is a very guided experience that prevents you from seeing a lot of the technical and system issues. It introduces a lot of interesting characters and sends you on a few awesome adventures before it really lets you have access to the larger world. Then the game opens up and you start to run into a number of the technical issues.

First the AI is nonexistent for pedestrians police and to a large extent the enemies you fight. You can be in the middle of the desert and point a gun at a civilian and the police will teleport behind you. The police have no driving AI. You can get in a car and run over endless civilians and they will never send a car after you. It is very easy to bug out the AI and make them disapear or ignore you.

Speaking of bugs, the game is quite buggy, in the way a Bethesda RPG can sometimes be buggy. I have had vehicles randomly explode or spawn on top of each other. NPC characters T pose or slide around. I have had my motorcycle randomly start flying. I randomly died while walking on geometry in the garbage dumps surrounding the city. I had serious bugs that required me to reload missions and in paticular the final missions I had to reload a previous save five times because it would completely break. 

Next is the terrible performance. While the game is certainly beautiful it also runs like I’m playing it on a Nintendo 64. Even with an overclocked RTX 3080 paired with a 10700k at higher resolutions with all the bells and whistles and ray tracing enabled you can expect sub 30 FPS. DLSS is the only thing that makes the game playable with Ray Tracing enabled. I’m not even going to get started on the console release but it is even worse.

The interface is a confusing mess of screens within screens within screens. Some things are only accessible from the top level while others are nested inside of several layers of interface. The quest log is broken up into main missions, side missions and gigs but a lot of side missions seem less important then some of the gigs. There is no way to filter these by area, difficulty or type and you sometimes have so many missions it can be overwhelming. That leads into level scaling. Each area seems to have a set level and if you try to take on an enemy with a red skull you are going to die in a single shot. There is no in game explanation why these enemies are suddenly so tough, and it does not feel quite right.  There were times when my mission log only had missions with these very hard enemies, and I thought I had broken the game.

Finally, there is also a lack of player agency and consequence. Rarely do your choices substantially change the outcome of the game beyond the mission you are currently playing. There appears to be no faction or reputation system in the game, and you can literally kill anyone without consequence or impact on the game. This follows all the way to the end of the game where the endings available are only impacted by a few side missions and a few final choices.

In the end, even with the misrepresentation of the game, the bugs, the interface issues, and the game just actively working against you at times, I have still enjoyed my time with the game. I sometimes just drive around or walk around the city and explore the amazing world that they built. From the amazing architecture, to the abundant satirical billboards and posters and even the minor things like watching a random NPC playing guitar on a dirty couch. It is the most complete Cyberpunk world that has ever been created and feels like a seminal moment for the genre that will help propel the genre into the public zeitgeist. 

The main story and several of the side missions have moments of extreme emotion, both horror as well as beauty. The game has some of the most interesting characters and performance in recent memory. Johnny Silverhand initially appears like a two-dimensional rock star ass hole but eventually I came to enjoy the little moments where he would pop up and comments on my current predicament. The character models and especially the facial animations are simply amazing during most of the major story beats, as long as they don't bug out, and these interactions are some of the most memorable moments from the game.
The gameplay is much deeper than it initially seems with multiple viable paths, between gun play, hacking, melee weapons, stealth and even some missions that allow you to talk your way out of situations. I primarily played an assault and blade weapon wielding assassin but I am eager to play again trying the hacking tree. There are attribute points, perk points, body modifications, clothing, weapons, hacking tools and many other ways to customize your character that I think would encourage multiple playthroughs. An issue though is the number of perks that are esentially useless or worse are actually bugged and do not currently do anything. Also there are bugs with gear where if you use the same item mod mutliple times they stop working making itemization frustrating. The character sheet is also very buggy and sometimes requires reloading the game in order to see your real stats.

I probably sound very down on the game but, even with all these issues, I have enjoyed the game immensily but I find it hard to recommend to everyone. If you fall into these three categories I can reccomend the game, if not you should probably wait for additional patches.

1. If you can put up with the bugs.
2. If you have a very powerful PC or Next Gen Console.
3. If you are a fan of Cyberpunk fiction and have alreayd played Deus Ex.

I am hopeful that the majority of my complaints will be addressed through patches. CDPR has always supported there games well and has released five patches at the time of this review and I have little doubt that many of these complains will be addressed. In spite of the games many shortcomings, I have been unable to stop playing the game for several weeks and would still rate it one of my favorite games of the year.

1609813286,"Nice cock, awesome balls. Sh*tton of bugs but the atmosphere... mmmmm... cyberpunk! All in all if you fan of the genre TAKE IT! TAKE IT NOW! If you are not, wait a year or two and then buy it with all patches, DLC's and a discount on a steam sale."
1609813187,This game is so much fun and so beautiful to look at.
1609813062,"Amazing! Breathe taking! And Buggy at times, but I love the story and atmosphere of this world. You feel apart of night city, especially if you drive around the city. The ""side quests"" felt like main mission quests and had there share of twist and turns. I went for a Samurai build so i cant really comment on all the weapons but slicing and dicing felt amazing (if doing this i recommend investing in the second heart implant because you WILL slice exploding things and die Alot) All the bugs for me we're minor like T poses, cars flying vertical in the air then crashing back down, looping gunshop interaction lines at the aldacados first camp and fell through the map once. 
I highly recommend this game if your ok with a little jank here and there. And i recommend you interact with people through your phone when they text you, it brings more immersion and other perks. Also This game will be a legend in a few years with mods and dlc."
1609812861,"It's good. Bugs bad. Bugs will get patched. Game fun, looks good."
1609812852,The gameplay and story are some of the best ive experienced but i have notyiced multiple glitches during my play time and you have to do the side missions otherwise it will get really hard since your weapons are underpowered
1609812822,"Has lots of bugs, still lots of fun. Looking forward to patches."

1609812708,"10/10
 
Would do the horizontal polka with panam again."
1609812686,Reviewer gave MS Flight Simulator 2020 10/10 even though it was so broken at launch that a lot of people couldn't even install it.  Does this game have bugs?  Yes.  Some game breaking bugs?  Yes.  But save often and load as needed.  Do as old school gamers do and be ready for software to be buggy.  Have that mindset and you will quickly find that this is the best game release in years.  Definitely game of the year for 2020.  Don't listen to morons that don't understand what they're seeing.  Play this game.
1609812656,"This is one of the best games I have ever played. The game play makes me almost feel like I am actually in the game. It has endless things to do. The game play is amazing. As the story progresses you start to grow a bond with the characters, and can almost start to actually care about what happens to them. I love this game!"
1609812505,"too many major issues for such a hyped game-- practically unplayable with the bugs. requires a high degree of ""suspension of disbelief"""
1609812487,great game
1609812486,"I do not think that most of the hate for this game is warranted. While I cant speak for all, in my playthroughs of this game I've experienced almost no critical bugs or problems. only in the very begging only an hour after launch did I have problems with soft locking but had no problems since. Yes there are a lot of graphical bugs and bad rendering issues, but I believe these will be fixed in the future with optimization updates. The story is good, but not the greatest, I remember a few standout missions and the endings were great. I don't think the hate for this game is fair, most of it stems from the fact they lied about the marketing and a lot of cut content, but if you review based off of whats there, its a good game. I'd say the world of cyberpunk feels barren in a lot of places that you wouldn't really ever be (ex: areas where there's no missions and places you need to go out of you way to go to) but certain areas feel and look amazing and full of color and detail (when it renders). I'd say that if you weren't expecting this game to cure cancer then you should get it, if you did then your out of luck."
1609812437,"lightning does not strike twice it seems
gameplay is repetitive at best and boring at worst, you care about non of the characters, skill tree is all passive and the biggest lie is that your choices matter (only very few at the end), plus all the cut content. 
It is ironic how a game about corporate greed has fell to its own narrative"
1609812327,"I've been playing since launch and have over 100 hours in so far! It is a great game, it could be a better game, but I think it will get there in the next 6 months to a year.  I highly recommend playing it now as is. The story is great and the soundtrack is awesome.  However, I can't wait to see how it will evolve in the year to come."
1609812146,"some expectations were not met, still a good game!"
1609811890,Ignore what everyone says about the game. Its amazing and I could replay this over and over. Thank you CD Projekt Red. This game was truly a blessing and its a shame that I'll never be able to experience this for the first time again.
1609811650,good game no complaints
1609811578,"Prologue is unironically one of the worst intros to a game ive ever played, takes like 5ish hours too, but after that the game is legit amazing despite the bugs"
1609811542,"Mid-line PC, been running into some FPS issues. Bugs are everywhere. Despite the problems, I keep coming back to this game. Very fun to play, interesting characters, and beautiful graphics. Story is awesome. I'd highly recommend it if your PC can handle it."
1609811384,"I thought the story was great and that most of the NPC's you meet and interact with were pretty well done. The visuals were, for me, absolutely amazing. Overall I really enjoyed my play through."
1609811347,"Trash development, trash story line, trash.... everything. Very obvious it was rushed to release, unpolished and lots of bugs. Save your money, this ain't it."
1609811328,"Bugs, AI, and performance issues aside ...the game is bad.

Combat is terrible (bullet-sponging or enemies dying if you wave your weapon in their general direction). The city is a graveyard where fun goes to die, side quests are yawn-inducing misery, and the main story is an achingly boring and insipid affair.

On the subject of story ...in the course of navigating the  milquetoast perfunctory writing and dialogue choices ...you'll be railroading into either responses that don't matter (e.g. you'll be forced to pick the ""right"" response eventually) or responses that don't allow the creation of your own version of the protagonist  (named ""V""), so much for it being an RPG.

...all the while, the V you are forced to endure is entirely unlikeable, largely due to the almost unbearably obnoxious voice-acting — whiny clueless male voice, or unconvincing ""tough-girl"" female voice. Both are goofy, generic, and ill-suited to any version of the protagonist's backstory (not that the backstories really matter to begin with).  

Some of the side-characters were pretty well acted though, if wasted by the story ...and by some I mean perhaps three or four, and decidedly *not* the side-characters the developers attempt to shoe-horn into your affections.

Another observation about the story — it exhibits no bravery at all, no willingness to take chances and leverage the potential of its setting ...which is damning, given the rich source material of dystopian 80's sci-fi punk. 

...E.g. does anything in the game really have that gritty neon-lit retro 80's feel? The juxtaposition of mind-boggling tech with oppressive pessimism and nihilism? Does it feel dangerous, or even slightly risqué? Did it inspire any introspection or thoughtfulness? 

Make no mistake, the game is janky ...very very janky (which is to be distinguished from bugs), but the worst offenses are largely ""soft"" issues ...not hard technical ones, and they had 8 years to figure it out. Future patches will not address those particular failings.

Bottom line: on its best day, without bugs, this is a profoundly mediocre, boring, and joyless game."
1609811284,yes
1609811086,its good choom
1609811021,"Pros:
-Very good story. May carry the whole experience for you if you enjoy good narrative. Characters feel real and have good motivations and dialogue. If you only play main story, you can easily get around 30-40 hours out of Cyberpunk.
-The ""main"" side missions, the ones related to the main story, also feel very good.
-Game itself is really pretty. Looks good almost always, except for the ocasional visual bug.
-Animations are pretty solid.
-Music and sound design is excellent.
-Combat is fun. Although it can get too steamrolly towards the end game when you have a build set up,  even in hardest difficulty. 
-There's a lot of variety when it comes to approaching different scenarios. Most of the time you can opt either for sneak or assault. You can make things easier for yourself and change the way you complete the mission based on your stats.
-Very immersive, except sometimes. The whole thing the game sets up with graphics, art, music, animations and 1st person camera gets ruined when an NPC starts T-posing on the backround, or when you see multiple shops and places that seem open, but when approaching them you cant go in because its locked.  I feel this last point was specially dissapointing in several places in Night City, because CDPR can fix the bugs, but im  uncertain if these shops and places will ever be open to explore.
Cons:
-AI. It is simply not good enough for a 2020 title. Pedestrian AI feels too basic, they have 4 interactions, when you shove them, talk to them, do something dangerous close to them (driving on the sidewalk, pointing a gun at them, shooting, etc) and run/cower in the place when something happens. NPCs in this last state dissapear when you point the camera away from them. Driving AI is also bad, or entirely non-existant. It feels like they are cars on predetermined paths, only stopping when you block their way or shoot at them. Races are pretty bad because of this, they rely on the cars spawning on their predetermined tracks because they struggle to do it themselves. Police AI is unacceptable. After commiting a crime, they usually take 2 seconds before spawning behind you. In all the hours I've played, I havent been chased by a single police car. The police forgets about your manslaughter/mass shooting or that kinda thing when you drive 3 blocks away.  Combat AI is ok.
-While your build does change your approach to a certain group of enemies, it's not important when it comes to dialogue. Your stats cant get you more money, an additional item, a companion, etc. when talking to other characters. 
-No customization for your character or cars after the game starts. A world obsessed with the looks should never lack barbers, tattoo artists, car modders, etc. Game needs a transmog option to use good gear without it looking awful. These features are likely to be added down the line in future updates, however.
-Going to a bar feels like going shopping, you walk up to the barman and buy him drinks, then you leave. There is no roleplaying to it. Same thing goes for cybernetic modification, eating, etc. May be added in a future update. 
-Too many bugs. Game is certainly big, but that doesnt excuse the amount of bugs there are. Its not unplayable, but may ruin your experience if you cant stand the ocasional glitch. This may be fixed in future updates.
-Cyberpunk has the same issue as The Witcher 3, there is a lot of content, and while main story and most side quests are amazing, other stuff lacks substance. There are too many places where you just drive up, slaughter everyone, loot, and leave. Some gigs (not most) can be completed with this approach, although the majority have some interesting dialogue and events happening.
-Economy is kind of bad. The gigs are your main source of income, and there is no way you can buy all the cars available by completing all the gigs. You can get a lot of money by crafting and selling crafted items, though.
Normal stuff:
-Crafting is ok. Could be better by making items harder to make or needing a component from a side quest but give much more experience.
-Driving is ok. Driving cars is not that good but I believe that motorcycles make up for that, as they are very fun to drive.
-Cyberpunk is 40-60 hours long, depending on how you play the game.
-CDPR will alledgedly add more free content and QOL changes, and fix bugs with time.
Im giving the game a positive review because I enjoyed playing it, despite all its flaws. As mentioned, story and characters are really good, probably the best of any videogame I've personally played. The setting is really pretty, music, animations and art are amazing. By the end, I grew attached to my V, felt their problems, highs and downs as mine. 8/10."
1609810791,even with the issues its still a great an enjoyable game
1609810758,"Honestly I can't recommend it. It runs like hot booty on a summer day. The city is beautiful, environments, all that. Side quests are plenty and are deep as you'd expect from CDPR. Main quest seems kind of rushed and is quite short compared to Witcher. Combat is meh. I can't recommend it at the current state for $60. On sale? Sure. Also make sure you have a high end machine. Music is dope though."
1609810453,"alright. So basically, it's one of the best games I've ever played. I mean, cmon. The city is amazing, they really nailed it. It's like you're walking around NEO-TOKYO from Akira. But what really sold me was the upgrades, I don't want to spoil anything for you but let's just say this game catered to my unique fantasy of being a superpowered cyborg ninja fighting crime with a Katana. What's not to like. 

It runs beautifully even on my machine of i7cpu/1070GPU. I love this game and I can't wait to play it again. Sorta sad I just beat it but it was such a great ride, I can't wait to try it again...honestly I just recently got VR and this game was the only thing capable of pulling me off of that. The only thing that could make this game better were if it were on VR. 

HOPEFULLY SOMEDAY!!!"
1609810411,"A fitting game for 2020 and what it had packed for a clueless and powerless humanity. An RPG that was stripped off of so many of the original base features that ended up being another action shooter just to make it on time for a disastrous release. Poorly polished, unfinished and downgraded beyond reason. Whole game is a travesty of what it was supposed to be. The irony?! The game's story and concept is what it came to be of the societal degeneration, when the world is running on money, mischief, the devilish corporations and their ethics going out of their ways to achieve their deeds with any means possible. Well guess what! Thats cyberpunk 2077 for you! The damn game portrayed its story and concept better by the way it was advertised and overselled itself to the people than the actual gameplay it had to show."
1609810677,"Ok as a person who has been waiting and following this game for a while it's time for me to say something (time played 234hrs). 82hrs is all it took for me to 100% a play through, did the nomad beginning and ending, and I'm now doing a street kid character trying to get the secret ending. The game is fun and I love the atmosphere, but there is a lot that this game is missing. I know there was a bunch of cut content and the lack of the RPG elements that were promised are gone, even some stuff like eating at street vendors, buying new apartments\houses, apartment\house customization, car tuning\customization, bars just being another vendor and not a place to actually hangout and meet people, romance just being a thing with characters on side missions or main missions, and whole host of other things. The beginning feels rushed as well with just a montage of you and Jackie doing jobs and then BAM you start off in a small gig, after that you begin your ""BIG"" gig right away. At this point you can power level your character with police activities and all the side jobs from a fixer that you never meet, you just get a phone call from her. Your character is forced by the story line to get implants right off the bat so the release cut scene of V and the random guy talking about getting implants to help you never happens (probably part of the beginning game that was chopped for a montage). Choices in missions do not effect them as much as you would think, outcomes are always the same or do not have much impact if any. 

On that note the game is not even close to what we were promised (but is still fun). Wish the gaming industry wouldn't fuck people over just to keep the backers and big wigs happy. Got an ok game for what I paid, how ever its not even close to what was advertised. Game is short and feels dead after all the side quests are done. I do not recommend if you are a person like me who followed from the start, but you probably have already done even more than me. 

p.s. I know all the bugs and so dose everyone else so I do not care to talk about it, plus if you bought it on last gen consoles stop acting like they should have even put it on those turds, coming from a former Xbox and Playstation user. 

p.s.s. For the love of god the way you buy cars fucking sucks and is super lazy, fix that shit, and add car customization. Oh and strip clubs suck ass too and the cops are terrible, no police chases, they just warp where ever you are not looking on foot. BD's are not usable either, besides mission driven ones, really?"
1609810280,Despite the early release and bugs the games story is amazing and the action is awesome. I know it was supposed to be an RPG but it's still fun to play and a great game with a kick ass story.
1609810165,ive waited too long to care about the minor bugs but they should fix whatever is causing it to crash so much
1609809929,"The biggest sin a game can have is being boring. Things like glitches and bugs can be overlooked if the overall game is engaging. Unfortunately to me the story really isn't doing much. It is however very nice to look at, but that's all I can say in support. Wouldn't recommend picking it up."
1609809856,I`m just exploring the world for first few hours and I love it. I can`t help it guys. It is great so far. If you are open to dive into the world of cyberpunk.
1609809830,This game is great on PC. I've got 160 hours in and love playing it. Can't wait to start my next character!
1609809812,Love IT
1609809758,"KIck ASS
"
1609809640,It's okay I guess
1609809628,"Awesome story, super immersive game ! Some glitches and bugs.  Played with a Nvidia RTX 3070."
1609809542,"First, note that my negative review is not because of bugs. I managed to avoid the majority of bugs through diligent driver updates. Bugs did play some role in this, but not a major one.

My major complaint with bugs was really tied to inventory management. As long as I saved diligently, I was able to reload whenever a major issue occurred. But inventory was the biggest bug - The rendering of inventory cards is so poorly handled that as soon as you get a few dozen weapons, armors, etc., in your inventory, every time you take an action in your inventory everything hangs for up to two seconds. While I've been diligent in clearing out my inventory, it's still frustrating to try and make a quick inventory decision only to have it hang.

While that's a relatively minor issue, I think that it really denotes the quality level of the entire game. Which brings me to my largest issues with the game - Immersion.

This game was overpromised and overhyped in a way that makes Fable III pale in comparison. We were promised a dynamic living world with options and opportunity everywhere. What we got was a major questline with limited decisions, a few side quests that tie into eachother, and a bunch of Ubisoft-esque open world missions all over the map.

For all the time spent working on the game, it was disappointing for the content provided.

The game includes driving, but driving is simply a way to move from one place to another. Apart from scripted events where vehicles are locked onto rails, there were never vehicular combat scenarios. Police simply teleport to you, there's no hostile vehicle mechanic that occurs. There's some racing, but it's very limited.

The game includes a player home, but apart from a place to stash your things (Which you can do with your vehicles) and look at a few random messages (When your ""phone"" i.e. menu has messages in it as well), it plays no role other than a location for a scene or two. There's no opportunity to purchase homes, decorate them, etc.

It certainly provides enough content for a $50+ game. I'm sure DLC will flesh it out in the future.

But the current state combined with the bugs, however minor as they are, demonstrates to me a level of quality that is not worth the price of a AAA game. Right now, it feels rushed, underbudgeted, and generic. It is very jack-of-all-trades in that it has driving, combat, exploration, open-world, missions, etc., but it doesn't do any of those things well.

The only thing that is top notch to me is the setting itself. The lore, the writing, the art design. I love exploring the city, it reminds me of when I first played GTA San Andreas years and years ago on a friend's PS2."
1609809492,"Game is alright. The story is meh. Bugs are a lot, but not game breaking."
1609809488,"Not that anyone will ever read this but to add to the statistics Cyberpunk is an unfinished, compromised, flawed and buggy game that should have been released as an early access. The community would have loved to pay $30-50 for the right to test the crap out of the game and provide feedback to turn it into the greatest game ever made. And a modding kit should have been created for it. 

And don't get me wrong CP has so much potential. Its awesome to fire it up and yes you can chew through the gristle, the off-cut that's been left, the unpeeled vegetables and the shitty waiter and get an experience that is 60% of the way there. But I don't want that. I want the three hat Michelin meal that we were promised. The greatness that we saw in the Witcher 3 (though admittedly i did get it three years after launch so clearly they had time to fix it). The world that we were saw in the countless clips and videos. I want the underground, a world where my choices matter and where i can be who i want to be and not a cardboard cut out with unbelievably bad male voice acting.

Sadly it will take years to clean this up and its clear that CDPR senior management and executives do not think they've done anything wrong. This is a quote from a CDPR developer 

""there is no finger pointing as of now. Word on memos comes from the top. The directors and senior devs are taking the flak for the team in what i'd call ""an honourable move"""".

What gets my utter goat was that it was absolutely clear that CDPR decision to launch was not made by the developers but by the colouring in department (marketing) and executives. The people who have absolutely nothing to do with the creation of the game dictating that it was ready to launch when the developers constantly told them it wasn't. Over 50,000 lines of dialogue was cut, hundreds of quests, interiors of buildings and the subway/underground was removed. The AI, characters, RPG, customisation was completely cut and replaced with compromised alternatives. 

And yet these senior managers have the gall to claim they won't finger point and they'll ""take the flak"". Well jeez thanks CDPR senior management. You won't blame your developers, for now, despite the fact they had absolutely nothing to do with the decision to launch this piece of crap early. 

CDPR executives lied. They mislead and decieved their customers which in many countries is illegal, punishable by imprisoment. Imagine i sold a car telling people it had a electric engine when it was really powered by a petrol one. This is the level of the lie that has happened and yet outside of the billions of dollars that have flooded into CDPR's coffers from people willing to accept the lies and compromises, people who give a thumbs up by the thousands claiming they had a good time nothing has happened to CDPR executives. No consequences,  no punishment for their massive lies. 

It is insane that hundreds of thousands of gamers sit their on their knees calling this game great when the evidence is in their face. This is a textboox example of cognitive dissonance.

This game should not be purchased whatsoever until it is in a complete state. Do not support or encourage CDPR for this reprehensible, illegal and unethical decision."
1609809428,"Despite it's bugginess, all of the things I wanted were there and playing with bugs and fixing them yourself is just a regular Linux way, so I was impressed that I at least got day 1 support.  

I think that if a game was going to be as over hyped as this was, it was only fair that the dissapointment if perfection wasn't immediately met was going to be catastrophic, and here we are. 

Are you not really expecting much, but to see some pretty stuff and walk around in a capitalist future hellscape? Then you're in for a treat!"
1609809279,"Quite an experience I must say. Cyberpunk is an open world rpg that's sort of also like a looter shooter, always looting corpses for weapons and clothes and healing and all sorts really, so if you're into looting then this is a pretty damn fun game, the loot could be more varied but otherwise still decent. The game world itself looks amazing and you really get pulled into the lore and the story and everything, lot of detail to it from all the advertisements to the people to everything really, a great world they have definitely built here. 

The story itself is pretty short however its pretty damn good for what it is, not quite on the scale of most modern RPGs, more along the lines of a high quality linear fps in a way. There is a lot of choice though, lot of dialogue and different things to say at different points which is pretty cool. There's also a lot of good side missions and a lot of cool characters that you get to know about along the way. There's also an absolute truck ton of other side activities like 'gigs' where you usually go in an do some sort of mission for fixers which are pretty much quest givers and there's quite a variety in that like sneaking into a place and stealing info or assassinating someone and stuff like that so that's cool. There's also ncpd police activities where you go to a place and kill some bad guys which is fun and gives you some quick rewards. All of the side missions and gigs and stuff is really the bulk of the game and takes up most of your time if you want to do everything in the game, I never really felt like any of it was repetitive so that's good. 

The characters in this game are all pretty cool and the voice acting for the most part is great, at the beginning I sort of had my doubts about Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand as I felt like his voice didn't exactly fit the character but by the end I was convinced and admit he did a great performance. The facial animations of the characters are pretty decent, doesn't take you out of the experience at all as its high quality stuff, I imagine it looks even better if you have an RTX graphics card so I really look forward to replaying the game in a few years when I have one of those.

The combat in the game is pretty fun, the guns are all fun to use in all sorts of ways, the melee is pretty dope as well as the shooting. I would have liked maybe more weapons overall, there's really not that much of a selection, for guns you have pistols, revolvers, shotguns, smgs, assault rifles and sniper rifles, all which each come in different versions such as Power, Tech and Smart, power is just straight up damage and then tech is pretty much the guns that can shoot through walls and then smart is the guns that can go around cover and home into enemies and stuff. You really just need a good tech revolver though and you're good to go for the most part. There aren't really many melee weapons though either, there's like batons and katanas and knives and wrenches and pipes and not much else from what I can remember. You can upgrade weapons though which is pretty cool, there's quite an indepth crafting system in the game that lets you craft all sort of things as long as you have the crafting recipe so yeah thats neat. There's also the cyberware melee weapons like the gorilla arms and the monowire and the mantis blades which are pretty cool and are fun to use, nothing that special though just an extra weapon. 

The game gives you lots of ways to customize your character like clothing and then there's clothing mods and then there's cyberware which are things you install into your body to get all different types of buffs and things from slowing down time to being able to carry more to having more health etc, all quite useful. There's also levelling up your character which gives you skillpoints to put in all sorts of things like pistols or hacking or athletics and all sorts of different things that you can use to give your character a little edge so levelling up is fun. 

The sound design in the game is great and feels very realistic, even just little sounds like picking up a glass, things that most games don't really have are all here, making the game a great experience if you're using headphones. There's quite a lot of music in the game which is pretty good for the most part and definitely fits in with the game world. 

Now those are all the good parts of the game, now for the bad. This game has a LOT of problems, first of all the optimization is absolutely terrible, on a gtx 1080 and i7 7700K I literally am unable to max the game out without getting like 30fps at best, the only way I was able to get decent framerate was to put a lot of the settings down or off and enable fidelityFX and set it to 80% so basically I have to play at 80% of my full screen resolution so unfortunately the game looks sort of blurry but for the most part the framerate was acceptable, until I go into areas in the city with a lot of npcs, then the framerate dies and can go down from 80fps all the way to 30fps, its especially worse after playing for a few hours it seems the framerate gets worse overtime so lets just say this game definitely needs optimizing, especially the npcs, they seem to be the one things that ruin the game, not only that but the npcs themselves are super buggy. You'll see them walking in mid air or holding an item that shouldn't be there or getting stuck inside geometry and other dumb stuff. Also sometimes npcs mouths don't move when they talk which can ruin immersion a little bit, also a few times in the game where npcs dialogue randomly skips for no reason. Things like this happen not just out in the open world or on the side missions but in the MAIN STORY of the game you'll find super immersion ruining bugs like this. I understand its an open world game and bugs are inevitable but they should have atleast fixed up the main story a bit better. 

Another big thing is the physics in the game, the physics are fucked and definitely need reworking. Cars randomly explode, trade bags randomly fly into the air, a lot of time when you're jumping around on rocks and stuff you'll get stuck in geometry and instantly die, this happened countless times throughout the game, sometimes you'll also get stuck on a corpse or something and get flung 10ft away, its just a mess really, definitely needs fixing. 

The police in this game are the WORST honestly the guards in Oblivion are better than in this game. Even if there is literally nobody in sight for miles around if you kill 1 civilian instantly the cops are after you and guess what they just spawn right next to you, they don't show up in a ship or a car or anything  they just spawn, such lazy trash like did college kids code this? absolutely lazy game design. Pretty sure they can also instakill you if you've killed to many of them. 

This game touted a lot about style and showing off and whatever but there's barely any clothes in the game at all. There's a whole lot more clothes that you see npcs wear than what you can actually find and buy. Pretty much all you get is a bunch of military gear and then some corporate stuff like skirts and dresses and high heels and then you get like trashy stuff like tank tops and shorts and all that and you have some body suits and stuff but just nothing really that good for the most part. Like I said the npcs have a whole lot more different clothing and much better style than your character is allowed to have in the game so that's a shame.

I HIT CHAR LIMIT SO LINK TO REST OF REVIEW: [url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aSb1tJb3XUCBlI7jcZupFLshDo3o0EBECXeB1oWLhic/edit?usp=sharing] HERE [/url]"
1609809946,"---To start off this game does not captivate me like other games do, I feel as if I'm at a point where I'm forcing myself to play it. I tried all 3 different endings and without spoilers I can tell you that Corpo is weak and lacks good narrative and gives you very little insight in how corpos work in the universe, Street kid is okay, but is still lacking in good dialogue while also not giving you a true in depth look at how gangs and similar groups work, and finally Nomad is the best with an equal amount of game play and dialogue while also giving you a close look in the lifestyle of Nomad clans. And while all three are unique once the cutscene  Nomads dialogue however can be cringy, and awkward at times. All 3 give us, the player, plenty of room to create our own backstories, but that seems to be one of the only dedicated RPG elements to the game. Many dialogue choices seem pointless as the outcome of the choice is the same for most if not all quests. I don't want to feel as if I'm forcing myself when playing games like this or any other. It's campaign has not captivated me like CDPR's ""The Witcher 3"" and while I understand they are two separate games with completely different narratives, you come to expect a campaign that will blow you away coming from this company. However the narrative is very slow and awkward and many lines of dialogue come off poorly or the way they're said is lacking in emotion, or has too much emotion when neither are needed. These lines come from major characters such as Johnny Silverhand, V, V's companion, V's friends, to even the non essential NPC's. 
---The combat is one of the better mechanics in the game, with both gun play and melee mostly seamless and has a similar vibe to ""Tom Clancys: The Division."" Unfortunately stealth is a mechanic that seems broken or established incorrectly, often times I would find myself being caught while never once showing myself to the enemy and only utilizing hacks from a safe distance. Having to reload a save many times for certain missions. Driving is arguably the worst mechanic as you'll find yourself gliding and drifting across the street more so than driving straight, or hitting a wall on a motorcycle and finding yourself flying. And while standard melee combat is good, the mission brawls much like in ""TES V: Skyrim"" are not challenging whatsoever and can be accomplished relatively easy even with low to no melee skill progression. Next for combat we get to the police, where you kill an innocent NPC cop and drone appear down the street, chase you for a few second until you hide behind a trash can, and leave. Making the whole interaction very boring and leaving much to be desired. Once you get to police level 3 MAX-TAC shows up which can actually be a problem but will leave after you hide for just a few moments. I was hoping that CDPR would give us a new, fresh experience to police notoriety with Cyberpunk but it feels like GTA V dumbed down at this point. With the traffic mechanic worse than GTA V. You car could be parked on the sidewalk because parking spots seem to not exist whatsoever, and have just a pixel of your vehicle in the street and all of the sudden you have a traffic jam. Endless honks and shouts will be heard but never once will you see moving cars.
---The bugs are still apparent, with graphics taking a few seconds to a few minutes to load, cars popping up in the street out of nowhere, and a multitude of others. 
---Finally, I have to say I'm extremely disappointed with this game. And while CDPR is on the case about sending out regular hotfixes which may make the game more bearable in the future, I don't foresee myself playing this game much longer if at all. Cyberpunk has left a sour taste in my mouth, and one I don't feel I'll be rid of for a while."
1609809237,"It's pretty immersive and the glitches aren't that bad on PC. You will need a high-end PC to run this, however."
1609809217,"I'm just gonna get to it. Cops legit spawn around you instantly, the bars and restraunts are just there to be there. There's about one line of dialogue with each store owner and the open world isn't as good as it was told to be, the AI are brainless and don't follow a day and night cycle. The scooters which could be seen in the trailers are also not in the game. The story is meh, nothing too memorable, I just want my money back."
1609809211,Just play Deus Ex if you want a fun cyberpunk themed action RPG.
1609809130,"An absolute must have, just make sure your PC can run it first!"
1609809120,smexy
1609809094,I had heard a lot of bad things about this game but after playing it for a while i can confidently say that yes even though it has a few glitches it is one of the most fun games I have played in a long time and i truly feel like some of the glitches in the game add to the fun of the game.
1609809032,awsome
1609808911,"Not gonna lie, not much fun in at best 50 FPS Night City."
1609808826,worth the money
1609808774,this game is absolutely NOT an RPG
1609808762,Being able to play the game with a EVGA GTX650 2GB videocard I am pleased to have a smooth play; missing higher graphical settings but enjoying the new World and enviroments. Waiting for RTX 3080FE to get in stock to complete the otherwise amazing end of 2020 PC build i did.
1609808747,Fun game. Beautiful graphics. Good story. I had a few minor glitches but nothing really game breaking. I highly recommend the game to anyone that has the computer to run it. If you don't get it now get it in a few years.
1609808721,My 1660 super hates this game. 10/10
1609808621,Buggy as hell... Fun as hell though
1609808583,I LIKE
1609808518,"Incredible atmosphere, great story, really fun gameplay, and COLORS."
1609808465,"Imagine ordering food at a restaurant and it comes to you under cooked, out of date, the plate is made of cardboard and the chef and waiter took turns spitting on your food. That's how it felt after waiting seven years for this failed abortion of a game."
1609808452,"While this game has optimization issues it still runs fairly well on PC and the game itself is not bad but don't expect anything groundbreaking

it has its faults but overall is a good game"
1609808402,"aside from minor issues, the game has run very well for me.  I did have to re verify the game files to fix a launch crash bug , and aside from some graphical hick ups so for the game has been good. The story is well done, do yourself a favor and don't rush through the main story line, so much is hidden through out the city."
1609808381,"I've asked for a refund.  You can't rebind half the keys, so the game is unplayable for me.  e.g. I use right-click to move forward, but it is inextricably bound to aim."
1609808345,Yee Haw
1609808342,Running an i5 10400 and an RTX 2070S. all settings outside of RTX are maxed and I'm sitting pretty at 60fps at 1080p. This game is a great time.
1609808618,"It's fun. I believe I've explored most of the significant nooks and crannies after 300 hours. Some very compelling missions, some relatively unique ways to complete them. Got some really neat weapons, combat is very fun (when the AI wants to play), stealth is very fun. Interacted with some interesting and some not so interesting NPCs. Played every ending (I think) possible.

I'm not here to rail on the Bethesda level bugs or PS2 era AI. Someone is posting a hilarious new compilation every few hours on Reddit or Twitter, even right now as you're reading this. I'm also not gonna talk about broken promises from CDPR because I didn't pay attention to much after the initial teaser and that driving clip that got shared everywhere. I'm gonna try to be as objective as I can, I don't feel cheated or let down by this game.

It's not genre defining, it's not particularly epic, hell at times it's barely coherent. There's a small set of decisions and outcomes, but you're more or less on rails for the story. You experience V's story, you don't decide anything outside of how cool you want to look and are quickly out-cool'ed by almost any NPC walking the street.

There's a bunch of recycled systems from games you've probably played before, most of those systems aren't really well implemented, thoughtfully designed, or inspired in any sense. 

The ""open-world"" aspect is more of a backdrop than anything else, it is gorgeous but it doesn't live up to the standard of immersion of AAA open world games in 2020. Outside of the main story line, there are only a few interesting side quests. 

Even on ""Very Hard"" the game is hilariously easy past level 10 if you focus your skills and abilities and make use of the crafting and upgrading system.

There are major core issues that will probably be solved with future patches/hotfixes/DLC... there are major core issue that probably won't ever be solved... it's got a lot of issues. 

If you're a masochist like myself who enjoys Bethesda games on launch week buy it, those of you that don't wait at least a year."
1609808114,"In Cyberpunk 2077 you play as V, which is short for Nolan North. In this game, Skyrim was replaced with Miami and it's super weird. You can drive cars but this is a hassle because you'll keep getting called by Steve, the Fixer from Detroit, who has the ugliest car you've ever seen on sale for more money than you have. There's a lot to do in this game, like going into the menus and finding out which raytracing setting is killing your performance, and then the game crashes. I like the part where the console versions are absolute garbage and you can boast about being a glorious PC user but then the other PC users are like ""lol ur using a laptop"" but then I'm like ""hey bro it's a 2080 Max Q"" and they're like ""lol that's like a desktop 2070 at very best"" and then I'm sad because I'm not legit.

You can play the whole game with only Burrito XXLs and a gun btw
"
1609807996,"Despite a few bugs and glitches this is a great game! Its been a long time since I have been this emotionally invested in a game and story line, and I loved my stay in Night City all the way! Beautiful and fun game!!!"
1609807773,This game is amazing despite the few bugs i look forward to playing this game running a rtx 3090.
1609807709,"The game has great potential, but it's not finished, nor optimized. It is playable, as in a Beta version or Early Access state. You can go through. You may need to reload some saves when script break, you'll see plenty of bugs, you'll be frustrated by some dumb collision/AI/mechanisms etc.

Don't make the same mistake I made. Don't buy the game as it will just let studios think they can do half-assed releases and get the $$$ anyway. Just wait until June when the real patches are in to truly enjoy the game."
1609807567,Goty
1609807451,"Immersive mixed RPG with a well-paced story and next-generation random event trees. Very cool implementation of many QoL mechanics and delivers on a fantastic experience with a robust multi-save management system. I've already sunk 100 hours in (including photo mode) and I'm looking forward to what the game looks like after coming DLC and expansions. Night City is sparse in areas, but delivers above expectation for amount of character-NPC interaction, in my opinion. 

9/10, only point off is for future expansions/patches to improve on a near-perfect experience :) safe riding chooms"
1609807379,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this game, but I have experienced one bug where i could see trees and bushes through the ground as you can imagine it was quite annoying. All i had to do was update my graphics driver and...poof it was gone that is the only bug i experienced my entire playthrough. Yes the game was seriously over-hyped and the A.I is kinda retarded, but the story was so good it left me feeling empty and kinda sad. So if you want a very well written story this game has one. I've still got so much more left to do in this game, and I found none of the missions or characters boring. I HIGHLY recommend this game, and i have no doubt that they'll try to fix this games shortcomings in some updates down the road."
1609807274,love it
1609807229,"This is simply an incredible game. If you walked away from this title complaining about this or that, you didn't take the time to smell the roses with this one and I don't respect you. Many of the negative reviews reflect what I took issue with in Witcher III, which I gave up on. Not this time. CDPRed has delivered a total masterpiece. 

Graphics 10/10 +2/-2 occasionally due to bugs

Sound and Music 10/10

Storyline 10/10 fight me. I cannot think of a better sci-fi title in any other genre that touches this.

Gameplay 10/10 and I played melee / katana, arguably the least expansive and most broken play style at time of release

Meaningful Choices 10/10 This game brought back meaning to a kitschy rpg industry. They let it cook. When I get the 3070 and replay, I'll know the ends I'm working towards and it will still be different and equally good.

Value 10/10 All triple A titles need to provide at least $1 of value per hour. Check'em

I cannot recommend this game more. Moving forward, I will judge other gamers by how they appraised this title.

Would look for a baneneko whenever I here a meow again / 10

Masterful. 3000 dollars + of titles purchased many abandoned halfway; nothing touches this."
1609807167,P good open world RPG. I like it.
1609807100,Would play again. Will absolutely play again.
1609807061,Great fun. Engaging story lines both main and side. Driving doesn't feel like garbage. Combat is visceral. Worth the money.
1609961716,its good once you get past the bugs
1609806822,"story nice but cliche, everything else is so boring, dull and stupid.
combat sucks massive ass, quick hack variations are so dull and small, stealth is like payday 2.
story is very good, but the only two decent characters are you and Johnny Silverhand (aka Keanu). The rest are so forgettable and you spend so little time with them it doesn't really connect you or make you feel for them in any way. 95% of your decisions don't affect shit.
The side quests are a mixed bunch - some are very fun while some are really not. The gigs and police encounters suck massive balls and get so boring that a 100% run will make you want to watch paint dry more.
The world is beautiful however, even through all the game breaking and graphical bugs i got through.
Cars and especially motorcycles run like the Mako from Mass Effect 1, except worse and are broken.
The romances are completely uninteresting and you never really even come to like the character.
The endings are alright. There are a few so that's cool.

Overall, nothing makes this game stand out from any other RPG/Open World titles except for the setting. Everything else is the same thing you'll find in any other game except boring or worse. Play Witcher 3 instead."
1609806777,"Don't get me wrong, I'm having tons of fun on this game. But it's a completly different game CDPR promised us, more than half of the features shown in trailers and gameplay are missing. 

The game is great but i'm just giving CDPR what they deserve, a bad review."
1609806771,A pretty good game that can become amazing if given enough updates and attention
1609806726,"It is a cool game, but not much re-playability. At least not for me. Tried a second path after finishing the game and it got boring pretty quick."
1609806685,Dyaaauam
1609806642,"Played this game and I have enjoyed it from start to finish, I would recommend this game purely for the gameplay and the story. 

it does have some bad moments with bugs some will make you laugh and some will make you reload a save to fix it, so remember to press F5 to quick save a lot."
1609806492,"I don't think I would've played this long if it weren't for the bewbs. Well played, CDPR."
1609806462,"I wish I could recommend this game but I can't.
I will change this review if they patch the bugs and add the actual features that were advertised."
1609806456,"game very buggy but I get to be a woman running around punching shit, so I think that cancels it out"
1609806431,"Good game, many bug"
1609806406,"Still buggy like for instance, there are sometimes when I load game save, I am unable to draw any weapons. But the game is improving."
1609806365,"Controller support works with PS4 controller Bluetooth. Go the hacker route! Stealth/Melee/Shooting is available in every game, so why not be a hacker?"
1609806293,Games fun stories alright the ending is forshodowed early as hell.
1609806249,"In its current state i can simply not recommend the game in its current state. 
First of this review is solely pointed at the parts of the game that are not finished, lackluster or out right broken.
I have really tried to like this game for more than a pretty looking benchmark tool, as it is quite taxing for your hardware. In about 100 hours i had to create 2 new characters due to broken missions or a corrupt save file, that didn't stop me from playing another 20 hours on a third save. Only then it was, when hotfix 1.06 utterly gutted what was left of my enthusiasm for this game by hardlocking me out of completing the story. 
If you can get the game for 20 bucks it is worth it for the bugfest of a techdemo that it is right now. If it gets the proper polish and fixes it will get installed again and maybe then ill update my review. 
Sorry for enduring my rant, and thanks for reading."
1609806212,if you like bethesda games (exluding F76) you'll love this game
1609806171,"It has fun combat and that is it.

As an RPG it is lacking depth, as a game it is full of bugs, and the driving is probably the worst driving in any game I have played. Ever.

In some scenes it locks you out of pulling your gun and in others it allows you to pull a gun and trigger combat. Why can't I pull my gun at all times and just shoot those f**king ""twins"".

Choices in dialogue very infrequently have an effect on the outcome of a conversation. The only notable one being if you punch this one guy who is begging to be punched by virtue of him being a complete asshole you can no longer purchase his unique cybernetics.

I could rant all day, but I won't. I have more important things to do and better games to play. I might revisit this garbage fire in a few months when they've had a chance fix the game.

I kept expecting it to get better and it didn't. Should have requested a refund while I could."
1609806031,"V: Just promise me one thing.  Don't forget about me.
"
1609806024,"All the people complaining about glitches don't understand the amount of complexity in game development, the scope and vision of the endeavor, or how far CDPR has come from their humble beginnings.

Pros:
1. Stunning visuals if your hardware can handle it
2. Interesting Characters and storyline that draws you in 
3. Voice acting is well done
4. Motion capture helped link that voice acting to good body language mechanics
5. The world they've built is compelling and is one of a kind.

Cons:
1. Some story endings leave more questions than answers, not in a cool mysterious way either
2. The background choice you make for character ends up not really impacting much of anything besides voice lines, there should have been more effort here for backgrounds per choice
3. You can only romance one character (why is monogamy still preferred in 2077 come on)
4. Don't tease me with wild braindances if I can't get up in em 
5. Lastly, there are glitches. Those will be fixed in time. I am happy they pushed the game out and that we can provide feedback to help improve it.

I recommend this game. I have almost 190 hours and completed most endings possible as a corpo. I will be back for another playthrough and hopefully I experience new sides of night city instead of just being a corpo rat.

Keep on trucking CDPR, haters gonna hate you just go make me that BD with the 3 mouth lady choopa."
1609805768,"Ten hours in and I haven't had any problems so far, not even bugs. The writing is pretty cool and the setting blows me away. I'm quite impressed, possibly in part to relatively low expectations"
1609805761,"I really like the game. It has a wonderful story and great mission, but it is buggy as hell. I'm running this on a Ryzen 7 5800x and a 3080 and can't get 60fps at 1440p (almost) max settings. The game also has some sort of power draw bug which crashed my computer, but i resolved this by undervolting my GPU. (my pc could survive multiple hours of small ffts in prime 95 and a full gpu stress test using furmark, so its definitely not the PSU.) Through the bugs and crashes, I have really enjoyed the gameplay and unique style."
1609805655,"Played mostly on High and Ultra settings, and beat the game in roughly 35 hours. No hard crashes, but a lot of bugs, glitches, an exploit I found to get money, and some side gigs unable to continue unless I either leave and come back or reload a previous save. I learned about all the things promised from the developer and they did not deliver what was promised with no explanation. Immersion breaking bugs and visual effects, UI issues that needed a reload, floaty car mechanics, no real weight to player choice, and only a few notable missions that stood out. 4/10."
1609805649,Stellar Game if your PC can run it!
1609805622,cool
1609805588,very good dating sim - recommend.
1609805566,"just, this is great concept, a great game
"
1609805487,"Could be phenomenal game with a significantly greater amount of polish (excuse the pun). A few things I'd like to see:

[b] Large bug fix overhaul: [/b] at present the graphical glitches and gameplay issues as well as optimization problems combine to form a significant reduction in quality of the game. Things that on their own aren't massive issues but add up. 

[b] Bolstered RPG elements: [/b] Basic things like bodyslider in customization screen, modification of your character's look beyond the start up screen (hairdressers, more cyberware you can see, plastic surgeons etc.) - it's a game about body modification and you literally can't do it. 

More factional relationships - I've killed hundreds of Tyger Claws but they don't even acknowledge my existence when I walk past. Quest choices actually changing your standing with factions and that being shown when you interact with their members.  

Street cred actually being worth something other than ""you can now buy x car"". At 50 SC I'm supposedly as well reknowned as I can possibly be and yet I'm treated exactly the same by NPC's as when I first started. At this stage it's just used as a progression meter for unlocking items but not utilized to it's full RPG potential. 

[b] Enemy/NPC AI improvements: [/b] In general the NPC AI and fight AI is fairly poor and the cracks begin to show after some playtime. As a melee brawler playthrough I was able to kill most enemies on hard in multiple punches before they had the chance to react due to poor AI function. Crowd's reactions are often innappropriate and don't make sense, Cops will spawn behind you out of thin air and the wanted system in general doesn't seem to be very authentic. 

Overall it's visually stunning and the storytelling is akin to Witcher 3 however it certainly still feels underdone and hopefully CDPR continues to remedy the game with updates. I think that with a bit of work it could be a considerably better game. 

"
1609805463,I like this game so much! Glitches are rare on my rig so I can immerse myself in the story line. Side quests are also quite satisfying. You just need a proper gear to play it.
1609805371,"f*$k the haters and critics, i love this game"
1609805327,"I vote with my money, all the misleading CD Projekt red pushed to lunch this game is unacceptable.
This game is a piece of art, unfortunately and quite ironically corporate greed had reason of the artists.
I got a refund and are boycotting this game.
If you value integrity and honesty and would like to send a message (however small) please don't buy the game.
Eventually they might redeem themselves like No Man Sky, we'll just have to wait.
I wish well to every want who worked passionately on this game."
1609805278,"Had a graphics bug day one.
Updated drivers same day and haven't had any issues since.

If you're not a console pleb, and if you're reading this you shouldn't be, its a 10/10 game."
1609805232,Groovy 10/10
1609805224,"It's good, but you need to have a rig that can run it. If you don't you'll have a bad time."
1609805187,"Honestly the glitches I can live with.  All games come up with something.  Over all, maybe my biggest headache is that I can't alt-tab and then come back to the game.  When doing so, bring up the map, all I can do is hover over an icon and see the information.  But you can't select anything.  Only thing that can be done is force quitting the game."
1609805157,"One of the best games a have chance to play. Story is great, main quests are dynamic and total feeling is more like movie (in a good way). After last patches it is nice and smooth."
1609805149,Few buggs that really bothered me. Fantastic story! Worthy of the banner of witcher.
1609805129,"only got 22 hours in so far. got kinda boring.  Games fresh but i kinda ruined it for maself with an unlimited money glitch. Overall recommend tho, would be more fun if i had to grind."
1609805089,good
1609805086,It's not perfect and RDR2 is better but I can't argue with 100+ hours of gameplay. It must be doing some thing right.
1609805085,Didnt realise people walk through walls and cars LITERALLY drive into the bin
1609805083,"Need a high-end PC to really enjoy this game, wouldn't recommend without one."
1609804970,Other than the occasional bug this game has been nothing but fun. a few issues with driving and things either staying on screen or not coming on there at all. i havent had anything major happen to me so far. this game will be the best game on the market if the little things are fixed. I've played for 11 hours straight and i love it. Bugs and all!
1609804949,"Those ""Bad"" Reviewers probably never played a RPG shortly after a release. GET A GRIP!  

I played 8 hours without a bug or a crash. Yes here and there are graphic glitches but that's normal. I guess you folks have wooden PCs, otherwise this game wouldn't constantly crash like you describe. You salty haters probably never even played The Witcher 3 but jumped on the CDPR hypetrain like the little fortnite kids you are. Even Skyrim (which was released almost a decade ago) has more bugs than this game and guess what: the game is still great, and for many the greatest RPG ever created. But there are still fucking flying Mammoths. The dissapointed Cyperbunk Hypebeasts would say: UNPLAYABLE.

The world in Cyberpunk is the most detailed and dense world compared to any RPG so far. Especially compared to Witcher 3 (which is a masterpiece), but there were so many dead spaces on the map that you could ride for 15 minutes without any interesting interactions other than some Ghouls. I know there are repetitive or ""boring"" missions in Cyberpunk. But you obviously never played another RPG if you consider this as gamebreaking. In Red Dead Redemption 2 you search multiple hours, if not days, for fucking plants or bones! But hey, let's shit on Cyberpunk, because there is a Delamain Side mission, where you search for cars. AMAZING. 


So my recommendation to all these guys who were hyped because of social media or something else: Go back to Fortnite or Among Us. I'd like to know which game you consider to be great if Cyberpunk is such a piece of trash? I highly doubt the haters played The Witcher 3 shortly after the release, or even played RPGs like Skyrim, the Fallout or Mass Effect titles. 

Funny thing is, this game gets so much hate for being unplayable but is still the most played game on Steam behind CS:GO and Dota 2. I guess it's fashion in this age to blindly hate on anything after getting incited on social media plattforms. 

Fair enough: I can't judge the main story after 8 Hours of playtime so this is just about the world itself and the technical aspects.
"
1609804881,"Fun game 
lots  to do
Adult themed for sure"
1609804842,"Wish there was an intermediate option, but for the general person, avoid this game for now.
It is a decent story bogged down by poor optimization, bugs, and over-ambition. 
The game when playable is fun and the stories are intriguing but getting constantly pulled out by drops to 20fps or game-resetting bugs bitters the experience."
1609804826,I highly recommend this game for the type of gamer that likes watching their games instead of actually playing them.
1609804816,panam
1609804800,unfinished
1609804456,"I meme a lot, I do.. I love a good joke and honestly this game is great but their are tons of bugs. It's a great game and the only thing holding this game back is the terrible way it was handled by the company that produced it. It could've been a garuntee recommend by everyone.

If you got money burning a hole in your pocket buy it, it's worth the time after the bugs. Otherwise.. wait."
1609804424,Pretty good story. Lots of glitches and terrible performance with my 1600x and 3070.
1609804319,Breathtaking
1609804140,"yes, not scratched the surface yet, yes there are bit that need a bit of polish to them. But, the devil is in the details and some nods to pop culture. 
mantis claws are OP
the Sir John Phallustaff... was it quiet day at the office when they put that in its literally ridiculous. 
game play and visuals are pretty good running on medium specs from a laptop.

the bad bits:
yes there are still bugs of various sorts, noting as bad as what is seen on consoles
have to set the Vsync frame rate every time i start the game or it makes some weird controller input lag thing happen.

its pretty good though."
1609804112,"Its really good but requires powerful hardware.
Can recommend only if you have a decent PC."
1609918473,"If you watched the 2018 gameplay demo and are expecting nothing less than a polished experience then I'd recommend you sit and wait a year and see what happens maybe get it on a discount.  If You can live with an rpg-lite fairly linear story and want to play for 20-30 hours, you can deal with the bugs and have the recommended specs with an nvme drive to top it off you should have a decent time.  Ran it with a 2700x, 16gb ram, Samsung 970 nvme and an airboost vega 56 with my old 24"" 60hz monitor at ultra and had a good time.  I'm no fps nut and sub 60 frame rates don't bother me(lowest recorded 37fps).  I enjoyed the characters and story, this is not GTA v or red dead 2.  It's like a super hot girlfriend that's way out of your league, enjoy the ride while it lasts and move on because you knew she has issues you can't move passed and she was never gonna stick around forever anyway."
1609804086,k
1609804039,Obviously need good hardware but a blast otherwise
1609803980,To many bugs man
1609803864,yes
1609803751,"Wait for a deep sale, if at all. If they want to ship a fraction of a game, you should pay a fraction of the price.

Obviously, the police/pedestrian/combat AI is god awful. I'm sure you could lose whole days watching bug compilations and that's hardly a fresh take.

The parts that work, work. The dialogue and storyline are enrapturing. Night City is gorgeous and the game CDPR clearly didn't skimp on making it come alive, graphically. However, Cyberpunk suffers in a big way to ""style over substance."" If this game got on your radar because of the sensational promising of a ground-breaking Open World experience, I'd strongly advocate that you pass on it.

I feel like the second you stop doing story missions and side quests, it's clear how... skeletal this game is. They built a lot of really cool setpieces, thought a lot about aesthetic and world-building, then were so under crunch that they didn't put anything worth doing/seeing in them. Everywhere you go, you'll find a seemingly-endless supply of 'Door [LOCKED]' and environments/people you cant' interact with.

I'm confident that the bugs will get ironed out with time. Less so, that we'll get any sort of overhaul of the /r/iwanttoapologize AI or breathing life into the myriad of ""areas with such potential"" like the Delamain Factory

Hope I'm wrong about that, though. This game could have been rad as hell."
1609803726,pretty good
1609803628,"I went in knowing I'd encounter a lot of bugs, and bugs there were aplenty! However, the writing is there to keep you going. Dark, gritty, sometimes disturbing; the gameplay and storylines are reminiscent of two of my all-time faves, Fallout: New Vegas and Witcher 3. Some of the most compelling quests are random side quests, and that's one of the things that really makes Cyberpunk 2077 shine.

Combat is alright, but there's nothing groundbreaking about the gunplay or melee. Driving is pretty bad, frankly, and I opted to fast travel a lot of places when I finished most of the side quests. Controls weren't terrible on the whole, though, and most things were relatively intuitive.  

A few of the characters in the game really grow on you, and a few times, I even felt a bit of emotional anguish for them. I found myself increasingly immersed in the life of Night City--a city I immensely enjoyed exploring. CDPR did a solid job with the map, and there's plenty to do and see if you're of the mindset. 

Although the first ""act"" kind of drags, once you get through it and the map opens up, it becomes a real joy to play. The game was even enjoyable enough to play through all of the Nomad endings... The first of which made me ugly cry. Crying aside, I definitely got my money's worth; I didn't beat it until around the 80 hour mark. 

Cyberpunk 2077 is, in sum, an excellent game. I fully support players who wish to wait for the bugs to be ironed out, but for those who appreciate real RPGs, the bugs--most of which are graphical--are a minor, sometimes hilarious inconvenience."
1609803591,"Amazing game, bugs are nowhere near as bad as people say especially since the latest patches. Story and gameplay is extremely fun and captivating. Probably my favorite game in a long time."
1609803569,its a good game (it has a few bugs) but its good
1609803563,This game is AMAZING if you have the PC to enjoy it! good job CDPR!
1609803439,"Such a love-hate relationship with this one. On one hand, its buggy as hell. On the other, it's fun as hell. They [CDProjekt Red] have a real gem here. Needs polish in every sense of the word.

Despite all the bugs, and me wishing I had waited another year (or at least a couple months) before diving in, I am glad I didn't. I can't stop playing. I have been ruined by the bugs, and will never experience what-could-have-been had I waited for some polish (and an RTX 3080/ATI equivalent). -Probably the best advice I can give. Wait a bit if you're patient. A thumbs down looks horrible, and I don't think it deserves one despite my 'hold off for a while' opinion.

The modding community is already going strong, and really helped with my experience (Reshade for HDR fixes, HUD element removals, volumetric fog fixes, etc). A positive shot out to the bugginess, for this game taught me how to revert Steam games to a previous version (thanks for that). Honest, I have an additional 100+ hours in an untracked 1.04 version (1.05... truly sucked on PC and forced me to figure out a revert option). Now with 1.06 out, things are working much better."

fix the game please"
1609803408,it still has some bugs but so far both game play and story are s good the bugs are easy to overlook
1609803331,"Good game, needs new game plus though!"
1609803275,Wait to purchase until they get this game to where it was promised to be.
1609803242,"Apart from a few glitches, overall the game is fun and unique. I have enjoyed playing it and would recommend picking it up for a play though of your own."
1609803181,Very good compelling story tho could develop more on the main side quests. Many different character builds. Very good game. Some bug issues but I believe like the Witcher 3 it will be addressed.
1609803065,"Lots of bugs, not a lot of gamebreaking ones though. Half the time I just laugh at them. Great story and writing, needs a lot more polish though."
1609803025,"visuals, story, voice acting all excellent.  the rest of the game needs work.  obviously lots of bugs.  world is barely interactive. 
 could be a really amazing game given another year or something of dev time.  still a good game as is, even with the bugs which are mostly comical rather than game-breaking."
1609802926,"Fantastic game (if your PC is capable), steep learning curve I felt, but the game is diverse and entertaining all the way. Wonderful graphics and city to explore! Very fun overall."
1609802897,"+ top notch main story & side stories
+ stunning, vast world. rich in detail
+ different styles of combat (mix of guns, melee, stealth, & hacking)
+ movement can be very fun (sliding, double jump)
+/- very much an RPG with crits, stat rolls on weapons, and leveling
+/- lots of perks and upgrading
+/- hundreds of side quests (most are pretty similar)*
+/- dialogue options steer you to the same result (most of the time)
+/- enemies can be damage sponges at times, especially on hard & very hard
- higher difficulties add nothing to enemy AI
- no police chase mechanics
- clothing focused on stats rather than appearance
- can't customize vehicles
- can't buy different properties
- can't edit character after creation
- lacks a lot of ""open-world"" content 
- police spawn directly behind you when you're wanted
- general pedestrian NPCs are just cosmetic items. They despawn once you turn around after acting hostile toward one
- bug list:
sometimes can't loot items, personal vehicle spawning inside other cars or driving away, random deaths when walking around**, can get stuck in dialogue, tons of cosmetic glitches***

* most of these side quests are ""go here, kill enemies or go here, kill enemies, grab this item. There are occasions where you will be asked to do stealth, or to kidnap/assassinate someone specific, but it's rare to find a side quest that's not combat related.
** mostly when walking off the edge of a railing, walking off the curb on a sidewalk, or the side of a rock, or any edge of an object it seems
*** floating NPCs, T-posing characters, loosing your hair when looking in the mirror, stretching palm trees, NPC's spawning out of nowhere, and many, many other small bugs 

Despite all the problems with Cyberpunk, I'd still recommend the game. My first 30 hours playing the main storyline was amazing. I didn't really experience any bugs at the time, and I was really immersed into the world. The dialogue was attractive, the characters were compelling, and the action combined with a riveting soundtrack made for one hell of an experience. 
Once I veered away from the main story and really started to play the game for the open world aspect, only then I started to see a lot of these bugs and serious issues which were sometimes funny, but were overall another needle poking at the bubble of immersion that I'd been in throughout the game. In addition to the bugs disturbing the open world experience, I genuinely think that there isn't really enough content in the world when wandering around. A lot of it is just the map and it's cosmetic, nothing beneath the surface. It doesn't help that 99% of NPCs don't have more than one line of dialogue. 

Essentially, the game in it's current state works very well as a story-driven game, just not an open world game."
1609802719,good
1609803100,"One hell of a job you've done, guys! So deep dive-in into universe, so entertaining adventure!
Just proud for you all! You've a great step into future for your company with this one!
Few bugs along the journey doesn't make it worse, but I hope you'll fix them soon to achieve ""legendary"" level.
Gratulujemy wielkiego sukcesu!"
1609885782,"Disappointed. Side quests, main quest and the graphics are the only redeeming factors for me. Everyone puts in amazing performances voice wise and the game is the best looking game to be released to date imo. Radio stations are really cool too. The only exception to this is Johnny Silverhand. He's shit as a character. I'm sorry but he just is and as breathtaking as Keanu Reeves is his monotone voice just puts me to sleep when I hear it.

Performance is not up to par at all. Some settings apparently do nothing at all for FPS while some absolutely TANK it while giving little benefits. Side gigs and jobs are lackluster and just copy and paste cookie cutter missions. Surely they could have done better here.

No proper wanted system with cops? Really? Cops will just spawn behind you as soon as you commit a crime and disappear within seconds. There are no car chases in the open world at all, cops sometimes spawn inside walls etc. etc. etc.

NPC AI is absolute garbage too. Enemies will just stand there like idiots taking hits like sponges. General crowd AI is the same.

The life path choices mean NOTHING except for lore purposes. Some unique dialog options that don't really matter in the story and that's about it besides the intro. May as well have not included it.

In game economy is absolute trash. Some guns can cost upwards of 180K and they sell for peanuts. Clothes follow no logic at all in terms of armour rating and looking back at one of the trailers where they show off the fashion in Night City along with vehicles and lifepaths, none or very little of that fashion is accessible to you. Most stores sell the same looking shit and I've found no cool outfits so far. I was really looking forward to the fashion too.

Driving is absolutely atrocious. Cars feel way too floaty and have no real weight to them. Even a slight turn at speed will cause you to crash into someone/something. Races are gibbed with the cars you're racing against teleporting randomly right behind and sometimes in front of you as soon as you're 1st meaning if you make one little mistake, you lose. What's really dumb is that the MAP DOES NOT ZOOM TF OUT WHEN DRIVING AT SPEED SO YOU'RE CONSTANTLY MISSING YOUR EXIT.

Character creator is lacking although I was able to create a decent character anyway. I just wish they'd put more thought into it. Gunplay is okay. Just okay. Hacking is clunky as all hell and it put me right off so I just defaulted to gunning my way past everything.

A lot of elements look to have been roughly pulled from TW3 and shoved into here. The inventory menu while familiar, should have been given an overhaul. It's old and clunky feeling for me. The runes system from TW3 has also been ported to clothes here and it's just old CDPR, it's been done already. Think of something NEW for your fresh, NEW IP. 

I hate the fact that crafting anything halfway decent is locked behind a fucking skill tree. This part they could have copied from TW3 and it would have been a TON better. Bugs galore and i've never given other devs a pass before but even after numerous delays with the ""When it's ready....."" release date they kept parroting at us, it feels like a slap in the face to be honest.

I wouldn't recommend this game in it's current state although there is an excellent game in there somewhere. If CDPR can fix the performance issues and bugs then I can see it becoming a classic. I hope they don't add in the missing features and content as part of any future DLC though.

7/10"
1609802595,"it makes me really sad to write this review but may expirience with cyberpunk has really been annoying.
i loved the story and the characters but everything about the gameplay has been horrible. the bugs ruined the expierience so many times and it crashed a bit too much to not make the whole game really frustrating. i would give it maybe 6/10 in this state. it would be a 8.5-9/10 if it wouldnt be for all the things ruining this game. sad."
1609802579,"Look man I can sit here say its not finished but damn this the best game I played in 2020. 4/5, potential 5/5 with updates and DLC"
1609802540,Skyrim can suck my balls
1609802489,Game is fun.
1609802475,"After completing the game and all the side quests I could.. Yes, it is a great game there were some odd bugs mostly during cut-scenes with cigarettes and drinks. 

The biggest letdown in the story is the fact life paths are really not much different and have no bearing on endings. Combat is pretty decent but this should be purchased for the overall story not combat. That looks to be just filler and something to  do other than talk.

If you want to get nit picky the fact V can only wear clothes you would basically find in GTA just shiny and higher res is annoying. NPCs rock cooler cyberpunk gear than what you can find/equip. Oh and driving sucks even with good cars I ended up fast traveling everywhere most of the time. 

Over all the story is great, had loads of fun snapping necks and will probably get any DLC that adds to the story."
1609802458,"Interestingly enough this game has not had the bugs others are reporting.
The frame rate is smooth and I can make adjustments to the graphic settings if I feel like I want more FPS.
Running a 980TI and i7 5820K which is quite old and it still never crashes or has any bugs.
It seems to depend on which hardware you are using to play the game and if you are playing it with ray-tracing or not.
I think it looks fine without ray-tracing and I'm having a lot of fun with this game."
1609802439,"Stunning visuals, awesome gameplay, immersive open world! Can't wait to see what future updates + the mod community bring to this game."
1609802417,awsome game
1609802367,"I have just one thing to say:

I shot someone on the street, cops appeared out of nowhere. I shot a cop, and other, better equiped cops, appeared out of nowhere. No joke, juste out of nowhere. One second, no one, the next second, 5 cops surrounding me. They did not came by plane, or car, or boat. They just appeared. 

And that is happening in a game made in 2020. This is a joke"
1609802111,"Don't let the haters fool you, this is a fantastic game that will draw you into a fully living world!"
1609802059,Great game.  PC version doesn't have any glitches.  Just make sure all your drivers are updated.
1609802048,awesome game absolutely love it havent had a single crash yet and have about 20+ hours on record so far bugs are nothing major in my experience there is gonna be some bugs to laugh at tho..
1609801970,"This game is obviously well crafted and extremely well detailed, no question. The issue I have is I bought this game with a different intent. I don't know if it was the branding on their part or the lack of research on my part. This game turned out a lot different than I thought it was."
1609801934,"This game has far fewer issues than you might think from looking at some of the angrier youtube reviews.

Yes, there are incredibly annoying glitches from time to time. I've seen one probably every 10 hours of gameplay. One of them has even prevented me from getting an achievement.

Yes, it's questionable whether this game counts as an RPG. You simply don't have the freedom to solve problems that you have in, say, the preview of Baldur's Gate 3. You are not going to be able to side with the 6th street gang, or radically break from the plans that Evelyn or Dex come up with. I've found that you have rather less freedom of action than Geralt does in the Witcher 3.  It's also clear that you're playing a character whose personality is already decided - V, like Geralt, has a definite personality and you can't mould him or her to be sensitive, cowardly or psychopathic.

Still, wandering around a gigantic game world, reading the immense number of shards that are left on the floor, choosing between a dozen or so viable builds, experiencing the 10 or so very well put together side-missions of the kind that bioware hasn't produced in 15 years - all of this deserves better than a thumbs down.

Perhaps, reader, you should consider waiting 6 months and buying this game in the next sale. I'm sure by then most of the bugs will have been fixed and the assessment of the game will be less clouded by frustrated expectations that have been brewing for 7 years."
1609801918,"I have pushed through about 70 hours of buggy gameplay because the underlying excellence and fun of this game demands it.

This is the closest thing I think I've encountered that I would qualify as playable cinema.

Fantastic game but if you CAN wait, you should. It needs more updates."
1609801878,"Enjoyed it alot even though it has a lot of bugs and glitches. They gonna get patched and fixed eventually and this gonna be 10/10 

Storyline is awesome and graphics are giga nice."
1609801872,"This game is terrible, like seriously if you're asking yourself if you should buy this game when it got taken off the PS store and handed out free refunds then I think your answer is crystal clear. aside from all the bugs, glitches and terrible optimization there is so much cut content they promised so much in the game and yet half of it wasn't in the final release. Might I mention the story it is so bland, the characters were poorly written and it ripped off so many other stories. It's not even immersive  this entire game sounds like it was filmed in a studio booth and the dialouge is so corny. The combat system was apparently supposed to make me ""feel the power"" but the only think I'm feeling is my PC heating up like a kitchen stove in any case the combat system is wack it   The driving physics were god awful too it felt like I was driving the Batmobile because I don't think anyone in CDPR knows how physics works. Also the AI in this game were trash they were more suicidal than the workers over at CD Projekt Red. Unless you have a high end killer PC like I do don't bother running this game because the gameplay will look like you're watching a slideshow. Therefore I don't recommend this to any players because people were just blinded by Keanu Reeves and hyped this game up like it was going to revolutionize mankind. If you want my advice I suggest you spend your $60 on a bottle of whiskey so you're not bothered by this games existence."
1609801861,"It's true this game has bugs and sometimes weird visuals, which can be immersive breaking.
Yet, when weighing the good against the bad, it heavily leans to the good side.

I really cared about many of these characters and even the controversial character ""Jonny Silverhand"" has a special place.
I fucking hated his guts most of the time, but I also enjoyed every dialogue with him. I don't know how they did it but that was perfect."
1609801782,Very glitchy but great fun.
1609801767,Great story with fun gameplay and a ton of stuff to do and see. Minor bugs encountered through my gameplay but nothing that was game breaking. Would definitely recommend!

Bad AI? Yes

Great characters? Yes
Great side content? Yes

Versatile ways to complete quests? Yes
Beautiful graphics? YES
Immersive? Yes
Fun? Yes"

Cyberpunk is everything you could have expected it to be, but, it's just a really good game, the story, the characters, NighCity...  if you have what I call the ""fast enough pc"" you can play it in it's most beautiful form and have a great experience, a bugged, but a great experience. For those who expected it to be a masterpiece, well, it kinda is, but, I trully recommend you to wait 'till 2077 to play it smooth."
1609801275,A masterpiece.

1609801115,"Loving this game. The world is so full of different people and the hidden stuff one finds is so neat. I love Mr. Reeves as Johnny Silverhand. He's sarcastic, caustic and too perfect.

Only complaint, wish. can we have an adjustment to the crafting so that we can craft a bundle as well as one at a time. It takes forever to craft an epic component from common ones. That's it. the only thing that bugs me about the game. So kudos for a fantastic game! Thank you!"
1609801110,"It's a fun game. I don't think it lives up to the unnecessary hype Reddit put on it simply because it has Keanu Reaves in it, but it's a good game. I had some bugs just as any other player not running the latest and greatest system, but none were ever game breaking for me. Captivating as it is the main story line is kind of quick but there's PLENTY to do in Night City. Just play the f****** game, Samurai."
1609801102,"Its fun...

However, the game is almost entirely half baked. Even on PC, the game runs poorly. On a medium-end PC, the game runs poorly. The in game mechanics are not standardized to the in game balance, such as crafting, or a lack of impact when using stealth. In combat, you are relegated to either doing a ""Guns blazing"" tactic, or using future magic, there is very little nuance to engagement. 

The Life Paths are less of a path, per se, and more of a conversation opener, and less of an environmental or world affecting change. That being said, I enjoyed the dialogue between characters. It is well written for the most part, and Johny Silverhand I felt is a highlight. I've been told that it is an linear sandbox game, and that is an accurate description.

The game needed an additional two years in development to be completely fleshed out and fixed. Purchase at $30 or less."

1609800833,"I personally havent run into any game breaking glitches or bugs. The storyline is great, gives you so many options, and really pulls you into it on a personal level. I do think there are lots of features that they shouldve added like more customization of your character, vehicles, and guns. But other than that complaint I love everything about it!"
1609800874,"It has well written characters, good main story as well as the side quests, beautiful vertical city, among other things, but you can see from a mile away that the game lacks of content.
It has various endings, as expected, but although I wish to know them all, I´ll wait for the game to be more complete and have an NG + option to have a motive to return to this game. 
If you are not to dying to play this game, just wait for it to be more polished and complete."
1609800627,"Alright. Let me keep this short and sweet. Content-wise, this is a mediocre game. Not at all worth full price.

Functionality-wise, Cyberpunk 2077 is a broken, unfinished product. All I did was try to adjust the graphical settings and the game WILL NOT GET PASSED THE CDPR LOGO. I get an immediate CTD. My PC specs are mint. I found no corrupt game files. I even uninstalled/reinstalled the game TWICE to no avail. The cherry on top of this turd sundae? Steam won't refund me because I've played more than 2 hours of it. So do yourself a favor and SKIP THIS TRASH GAME."
1609800645,"Note my setup. Ryzen 7 3700x and an RX 5700 XT. I finished my run in about 80 hours on my main save, and while i didn't finish everything, or play every ending, I did complete every major side quest and all of the gigs. First. The world absolutely drew me in. Now, it's more cyber than punk, but all the themes of this universe are there and prevalent. The design is gorgeous. Nothing seems out of place. It's rich with detail, BUT, some AI design issues sucked me out of the idea of this being a living world occasionally. Nothing major of course, and nothing that made me want to stop playing. A solid 8/10.
Second. The combat. It's fun, but feels stiff and a little outdated. It was fun to develop a distinct style into late game though, especially when i traded out my hacking abilities for a long duration slow motion ability. The weapons all feel unique and fun to use. Sadly only 2 stats ended up mattering to me. Armor and DPS. Slapping Crunch and Armadillo mods on all my equipment was most effective for me, but I would've liked to experiment with things like crit chance and evasion if only it could match the prowess of maxing those two stats. All in all, combat is a solid 7/10 if you just have fun with it (which is the point of video games innit?)
Now the story. CDPRed once again does not disappoint. I felt like every choice i made mattered, and for the most part they did, up until the end where you are met with 2 or (depending on whether you did a certain side quest or not) 3 choices for the ending, each with the big choice at the end. I played said side quest ending and damn did it get me emotional. Happy endings are always nice eh? Quest design is top notch, and they took all the things they did right with The Witcher 3 and ran with it. The Ubisoft style map marker activities were repetitive, but were rewarding enough to warrant me completing most of them. Overall I'd give it a 9/10 on story and side quests. 
BUT, WITHOUT A DOUBT, THE GAME IS UNFINISHED AND BUGGY AS HELL. I feel like one of the lucky ones. Only crashed maybe 3 times during my whole play through, fell through the map once, and most other issues were resolved with quicksaving and reloading. With that in mind, be warned. You could have it much worse, as many others have, but if you're willing to wade through the bugs and glitches (and maybe ignore some of the glaring issues with the AI design) there is still a great game to be enjoyed. All I can say is if you play the game, good luck, and I hope you have as much fun as I did."
1609800421,"Lots of bugs as expected. Wait for a patch, there are some strange issues when doing side quests like the inventory suddenly increasing all the way up to 210000, Idk how that happened tbh."
1609800341,Love Cyberpunk 2077!! Definitely worth playing!
1609800111,"Is it buggy? Yes. Is it unplayable, far from it.

The only real issue is the effect capitalism is having on our planet and society - something which is illustrated to great effect in cyberpunk. The characters are beautifully constructed, with a plethora of different cyber modifications that almost seems unique to each character - much like how real world people take individualism in a neoliberal society and add their own unique flare to it, say by having a cooking instagram account, or tweeting about their favourite Amazon purchase.

Something that is really striking in the game is the lighting effects - provided you have an RTX graphics card. This makes for some truly crepuscular lighting. Having just killed a small group of desperate scavengers, i paused to soak in the ray-traced scene, the red of their blood ambiently lights the graffitied wall of an alleyway where some of the many people made homeless by a neoliberal free market took shelter. I even noticed on the side of an abandoned car that i could see the reflection of a woman, crying for the loss of her child - truly amazing. Scenes like this simply would not have been possible without the marvel of RTX.

One of my favourite bugs so far is if you load the corpse of a (for example) exploited corporate body guard into a car trunk, and then proceed to blow up the car, the corpse will instantaneously teleport back to your shoulder. As if killing them was tolerable in a free-market free-gun society, but desacrating the corpse in a car explosion was just one step too far.

Part of the game i really enjoy is just how deeply involved you become in V's motivations. I really did feel the emotion beset by him to be as self oppressed as society moulded him to be. Before i knew it i was writhing in vacant minded joy at the materialistic pursuit of cars, guns and clothing - truly i wanted to own it all. Then there was the truly self oppressing acts of hacking my own body, throwing away the eyes my ancestors gave me in exchange of optics which allowed me to inflicted pain at a distance to my enemies. V's body bore the scares of irreversible ripper-doc surgery, metallic lines, bolts, plates and wire ports decorated every spare square centimetre of V's flesh - all in the pursuit at being the best at hurting others. Simply marvelous.

All in all, i can whole heartedly recommend Cyberpunk 2077. It strikes deep into the pursuit of things i don't fully understand about a capitalist neoliberal society whose governance is dependant on the vitriol self annihilation and self pacification to the great and holy free market systems that rightfully seek to empty and own the minds of the proletariat.

It is with that i give this game a solid 8/10 free stocks when you apply coupon EXPLOITTHEWORKFORCE at checkout, though if you already played Crash Bandicoot back in '96 i'd give it a miss coz lets face it no game topped that gem."

1609799555,"Despite all the various talks about severe bugs, I did not encounter any so far.
There is a lot to do in the game, several side missions to choose from.
Got now over 55 hrs into the game, and still not discovered the whole map."
1609799548,"The game was really fun, if you are a fan of the futuristic type of atmosphere then night city is serviceable as a walking simulator on its own. However the game is so much more than that, stellar graphics, an above average story and intriguing game play that kept me interested throughout the experience. Although if you are sensitive to bugs, I would wait a couple of months."
1609799493,"It's about as buggy as you've heard. I will say, however, that none for me have been anywhere near game breaking (albeit immersion breaking at times), and the story is very good. I'd give it some time and then play it after some things have been ironed out."
1609799385,One of the best games I've played in awhile.
1609799367,
1609799472,"This game has it's flaws, the bugs in combat, in the world, I personally ran into some quest bugs as well as while talking on the phone. The list is long but overall I would say that this game is amazing.

The visuals in this game are stunning, CD Projeckt Red did an amazing job at crafting a very captivating world, exploring this city at night in a vehicle is just... wow, what a spectacular world.

A lot of people have their own opinions about the game, some don't like it while others will praise it. I fall under the praise category. If you want to wait until the game gets fixed that's perfectly fine but just know that you are missing out on a truly epic and memorable game. The story as well as the side missions provides you with enough content to sink well over 100 hours if you truly want. Having completed the main story I still play this game to this day and will not until I finish everything that it has to offer and so far it's offered so much more than I could have anticipated.

I look forward to what plans the developers have in the future."
1609799356,"Flat-out awesome. You'll need a beefy system to run it at preferred eye-candy levels, but with some tinkering you can get it to a playable framerate while still being purdy. I run around 40-45 FPS at 2k ( which would usually be a deal breaker for me) but in this game - TOTALLY fine. 
Buy it Choom!!"
1609799300,"Story line and quests are really good but there's so many things in this game that just ruins the immersion. The global AI is like something out of GTA 3. The side quests are pretty much copy and paste missions over and over again. Ah, then there's the bugs! Where to even begin with the bugs. I know on PC it hasn't been as bad as what it has been on consoles but still, this game should never of been released when it did. 8 years of hype for this game and it's flopped like a sack of potatoes.

In conclusion,

I would seriously hold out on this game and wait for CDPR to fix this mess. But even with the patches, I don't think it's gonna turn it into this next-gen groundbreaking RPG because it just simply isn't. Take your time with the story and enjoy the visuals and then probably never touch it again."
1609799245,"If you're looking for a next gen RPG where your choices affect how future events unfold, how characters and factions/groups view and react to you, if you're looking to immerse yourself in a ""living, breathing"" open world which offers interesting locales to visit, activities to take part in, then you should probably look elsewhere, because Cyberpunk 2077 doesn't deliver on any of these aspects (which they advertised). Viewing each of these separately:

Weak RPG mechanics: 
- Game is linear: the only TRUE choice that actually matters is the one you make on the last mission and that's it, the rest don't matter.
- Customization: Stats are attached to clothing, no transmog system. No third person view (even on cut scenes), so what's the point in changing your appearance if we add to this that it's a SINGLE PLAYER game?
- Cyberware was a very interesting concept that never got the attention it deserved, hardly any of them change the way you play or approach missions. 
- Boring attribute and skill system: 3% more damage with handguns?! Wow! thrilling stuff . . .

Bad Open World: 
- Variety of vehicles: You can only drive cars and motorcycles, that's it, add to this mediocre driving mechanics and you have one of the worst transportation methods available.
- NPC AI is laughable: They don't respond to your actions, they don't know how to drive (they use set paths), they say the same two lines over and over, they don't aggro you, the list goes on.
- Police AI is nonexistent.
- NO side activities besides shooting goons and/or driving from point A to point B.
- Map is cluttered with copy pasted content to extend playtime.

Conclusion: I haven't even talked about the bland gameplay, huge amount of bugs and glitches, optimization issues, memory leaks (game runs worse over time) and many other aspects. I really tried to like this game, I played through its entirety, did all side jobs and repeated certain missions to view if any of my choices mattered, hoping to find any redeeming qualities, but alas I never did.

1609798878,"Cyberpunk 2077 isn't just a broken mess. It is a manipulative, cynical, hypocritical broken mess.

I went into this game having seen virtually no marketing for the game, and none of the trailers. For the most part, I enjoyed the experience. It was an entertaining, if not fairly basic/unrefined action RPG. Like a decent Fallout (better than 3, worse than 4 and NV), but with some GTA elements. Again, it was fine and mostly enjoyable. 

The one major positive I can say is that its visual storytelling is on another level (*when it works*). The immersion of the first-person perspective along with really effective voice acting and mo-cap makes you really care about the characters you choose to invest time in. I wish more of the game had been this kind of interacting, it was easily the best part of the game. However, the romance options are incredibly limited, and boil down to basically a single in-game mission and maybe a small mention in the ending (if you picked the arbitrarily ""correct"" paths along the way). Unfortunately, the majority of the writing is pretty shallow and has little to say.

The game is still a bug-riddled mess, even on an up-to-date PC. NPCs walk through the environment, T-pose out of nowhere, or just disappear if they go off-screen for even a frame. The combat is.. fine. There's nothing special here, and every one of my friends who likes FPSs said the gunplay was absolute garbage. I figured that out pretty early on myself and went straight Intelligence/Hacking, which offered an interesting approach to the combat, but one that ended up being the same thing over and over and over again with no real variance. 

Then you look into what the game was advertised as, what it was supposed to be, and (maybe most importantly) *who* it was marketed to. CDPR was dishonest and misleading from the first look at Cyberpunk 2077. Go back and watch the 48-minute gameplay preview from 2018; it's an entirely different game. Clearly CDPR's intentions were much greater than their abilities, as most of the groundbreaking features seen in that preview are just not even hinted at in the final product. This is on top of the trans-phobic, dog whistle marketing campaign that surrounded this game (primarily on twitter). Despite the demands of factions of the internet gaming ""community"" that politics be left out of gaming (and the impossibility of this demand in the first place - art is politics, people), CDPR's marketing department took full advantage of what is basically a political culture war between conservative and progressive gamers. Blatantly including lgbt themes and imagery to stir up the right, while using said imagery in offensive and insensitive contexts to stir up the left; there is no such thing as bad press, after all.

Overall, CDPR made a broken, unfinished, cynical, dishonest, and incendiary product, while fully aware of its incomplete state and inability to run on current gen systems (PS4, XB1). Don't buy this game, don't support their anti-consumer practices, don't encourage their political muck-raking. Save your money and get a better RPG from a less greedy, cynical producer. Buy something from Obsidian or From Software."
1609798619,"The game is amazing, inmersive and with graet storytelling, i love it"
1609798601,"It's a decent game. Not worth the amount of hype it got but definitely not worth the amount of hate. It's not great, but it's not the worst thing in the world"

1609798120,YEs.
1609798045,"Cyberpunk is a great game. I was looking forward to its release, and the game was even more fun than I expected.
If you enjoy Skyrim and Fallout 4 I see no reason why you would not like Cyberpunk as well.
CDPR did a magnificent job with the world building to create the illusion of a complex society. I have been a fan of Shadowrun and the cyberpunk genre for a long time, and it is great for me that someone finally made an open world Cyberpunk game.
It pains me to see all the negative press that Cyberpunk is getting, because it's a great game. I suppose there's no such thing as bad press because if a game no one was interested in playing had a problematic launch it certainly would not make the news.
As for complaints of glitches; have you ever played a Bethesda game on launch? The glitches in Cyberpunk are very minor, certainly not anything that would make the game ""unplayable"". (Note, I bought the game on launch day and I play it on PC.) 
I have no complaints about Cyberpunk, but there are a few features I am surprised are lacking:
1. Faction standing. Fallout games tend to require you to pick a faction to support and you become the enemy of other factions as a result. The factions in Cyberpunk seem to not remember you despite any good or harm you have done them. You are a true mercenary; you will do work for the Tyger Claws, and hurt their interests too. 
2. Drone controls. Shadowrun has a class called the ""Rigger"" which specializes in piloting drones. I don't think that would be a play style I would be interested in, but it seems strange that there isn't a way to make and command drones. I imagine it would play sort of like a conjuration mage in Skyrim.

To conclude: This game is like being Corvo from Dishonored in an open Fallout world. Cyberpunk is an amazing open world experience that I think any fan of the cyberpunk genre should try. If you like Fallout 4 and Skyrim, I see no reason why you wouldn't love Cyberpunk 2077."
1609797937,"I have been playing this for the past few hours, ticks all the boxes! If you have the specs to play this smoothly, worth the buy"
1609797858,"My experience had surprisingly few bugs. I will not defend the unplayable experiences on other platforms, but I am writing this review on my experience of the game. The story was great, the characters were likeable and I enjoyed every minute of it and intend to play it again.

1609797509,"[h1]Review made as of version 1.06 and 80 hour playtime.[/h1]

I cannot recommend at this time due to some game breaking bugs.
[list][*][b] Several audio and visual glitches[/b]
[*] Had music stuck playing during and after cutscenes
[*] Textures flashing to semi-random colors after a few hours of play
[*] UI stuck on screen
[*][b] Impossible AI detection[/b]
[*] e.g. Why does the AI know where I am when I remote control a turret?
[*][b] Teleporting cops[/b][/list]

And one that annoyed me the most was I would set my 'heal' hotkey to use a low tier MaxDoc, which I had hundreds of, but then it would auto switch to my high tier MaxDocs which I only had a few of.
I would press the hotkey to heal, just to top off the little health I lost, and unintentionally use one of my few high tier MaxDocs, wasting most of it.

The quests are mostly bug free, and most issues can be fixed by reloading a save.
[hr][/hr]

""If you don't recommend the game, why do you play it?""

I played for the characters and their stories. I had to work to get past the bugs, and I reloaded saves several times to reset audio and graphic glitches.
The most annoying things were those that could not be reset by reloading the save; like AI detection and health kit auto-swapping.

If you can get past these issues, this game is for you. I does have a great story, but the gameplay is a bit buggy.
Go play ""Watch Dogs"" or ""Watch Dogs 2"" for better gameplay and worse story ;p"

1609796513,"Great atmosphere, nice story and beautiful graphics but a bit buggy and feels incomplete."
1609796384,"I waited to finish the game 100% (I think...) before reviewing, because it's only fair to do so. It took me 91h to finish every side job, task and one of the endings for the main quest. I don't feel like writing an essay so I will just list the good and the not so good.

The good

- The Story is incredible. This includes the main story and the secondary quest lines, which are all somehow related to the main story. It really makes you feel for the characters involved. Also the stories have different outcomes depending on what you do. Definitely the best part of the game.
- The City is beautiful. I found myself walking rather than driving most of the time, and I barely used the fast travel at all. It's very immersive and the scenery is beautiful and diverse, also extremely detailed. Night City is seriously a masterpiece of 3D modeling. 
- The art direction for this game is fantastic. All weapons, cars, clothing, NPCs and their attitudes, the way they talk and relate to the world, etc. Everything feels right, like it really is its own reality. Also the lore, the easter eggs and small stories you find along the way makes the world feel alive. 

The not so good

- The RPG elements of the game feel pointless at times. You MUST play this game on the hardest difficulty, and even then it feels like a walk in the park. Doesn't matter what build you go after, you'll be overpowered as soon as mid-game. 
- The game still has a lot of bugs, you gotta remind yourself to save the game (there's autosave anyway) in case something weird happens. On the bright side loading the latest saved game will fix most bugs. I'm aware this is bad on consoles but on PC it's just funny. Personally I didn't find any game-breaking bug or anything like that. 
- The AI can be very weird at times, from enemies not seeing you at very short distances to NPCs and cars suddendly disappearing as you turn your head. I'm sure they will end up fixing it.
- The game is missing some features you can clearly tell were meant to be added at some point during development. Also it's missing certain things that would really improve the open-world RPG experience, like being able to paint your vehicles/clothes, or change your character's appearance. I understand the game is huge and these things would take even more time but it'd have been nice to have them. 

Conclusion

Overall the game is great and a lot of fun. I know I'll be playing it again in a few months with a new build and different starting point. I'm very tempted to replay the ending (which you can do) just to get the different outcomes, but I know it's the kind of game I'll come back to every year, so there's no need. Don't let the bugs and the haters make you think the game is not worth it, they don't know what they are talking about, it's a very impressive game with a lot of heart put into it.

Final score: 9/10 Highly recommended"
1609796323,"Awesome game, I use geforce now to play it tho so i cant really complain about performance issues. Being soft locked out of a side storyline isnt great tho, game needs a lot of work. Its a lot of fun tho."

1609796199,It's super glitchy. You may have to reload your game to get out of a wall or similar. Overall though it's been pretty fun.

1609796150,messy fun
1609796083,best game
1609796055,"Paid $60, had my day ruined. Will absolutely do it again."
1609796036,"I was on board the eight-year hype train for this game and I can't say I'm disappointed. It's fair to say the launch has been a botch job - however I have only encountered a few visual glitches and a couple of bugged quests which meant I had to reload my save. 

Positive: The setting of Night City is a stunning achievement and the game experience is totally immersive.  Quests are well-written and there is a good variety of different activities on the (huge) map for when you want to take a break. Characters are generally interesting, well portrayed by their voice actors and easy to connect with and care about - with Keanu's Johnny Silverhand as an obvious standout. There are little touches, such as NPCs changing outfits as questlines progress, which subtly reinforce the idea that these are real people with lives independent of the player. 

There are options to tackle objectives with a 'guns blazing' approach, stealth or a mix of the two. Skills such as hacking and crafting improve the more you perform their related actions and there is a deep levelling and perks system backed up by the ability to switch up your cyberware and weapons loadout as you choose. 

Negative: The driving sections are a bit odd with vehicles feeling quite weightless and the mini-map sometimes behaving like a Google route planner with a slight lag. 

Overall, I've stopped worrying and learned to love Cyberpunk 2077!"
1609795952,"The base game is good. It has good mechanics. It has good music. It has good visuals. It has good story. But it's still buggy as hell. If you have good PC to blast through the problems it is awesome game. I think it will be the game of the year in 2021 when it's ready, but before it's done it's only a good game. PS. It has not delivered on all the promises CDPR made."
1609881819,"145 hours in, 100% completion, time for thoughts and review.

[b]TLDR[/b]:
The game is pretty good in the current state, but far from being polished (he-he), tons of bugs (being fixed), great graphics on a good pc, gameplay is really fun and engaging. [b] 7.8/10 [/b], but I'd expect it to get higher as bugs getting fixed and content being added. For 1.06 I'd wait till the sale/first DLC to see the progress.

[b]Long Version[/b]:
Although I'm a huge cyberpunk genre fan, I wasn't quite following the development of CP77 from the start, as my laptop was kinda old and I didn't expect it to run even intro of the CP77. But last year I bought a high-end PC for this game and Doom Eternal. I wasn't expecting much from the game and maybe this is one of the reasons I was not disappointed and pretty much enjoyed the game to the point of clearing it.

Gameplay wise it is [b]Action[/b] first and [b]RPG[/b] second. I started as a hacker/crafter and for the most part it was not as enjoyable as if i'd gone with melee/gunslinger/shooter style of gameplay: shooting, slicing and dicing in combats is extremely fun and action-packed. Steals is far from perfect and not always even an option, and you will still require a few points invested in health for the sake of survival. Hacking/crafting approach is still a viable option (especially with hacking capped), but will take more time for fighting from the steals/with grenades and kinda more tedious and repetitive. So bear this in mind if you don't want to cap till the end game. Driving is kinda ok, and is more arcade-like than even in GTA 5 (btw you can't heal in cars). Gameplay cons are extremely boring crafting (you cant use multipliers and have to craft any piece one by one, come on, i don't have that much time to craft 100 grenades or upgrade components) and AI, especially NCPD. Most of the enemies are pretty dumb when it comes to fighting and NCPD reacts to ANY crime and teleports even in the badlands from nowhere. Luckily, they have hard time following you. [spoiler] [b]Also[/b] you cannot hack cops, but remember that this is cyberpunk, and your hardware is corpo-controlled[/spoiler]. Regarding bugs: the game is still ridden with them and could use a lot more of QA. Most of them are not game breaking ones like T-poses are randomly exploding cars in a distance, the worst I had was insta-death upon jumping on some weird objects, but for the most part it was tolerable for me.

The main plot while being pretty short also adds a lot to the whole enjoyment and feels like a highly dynamic action movie with you as the main character. Some sidequests (Delamain, Sinner, the one with [spoiler]sentient[/spoiler] SCSM) are also quite enjoyable and raise interesting dilemmas and questions, most of the fixer and NCPD quests are straightforward fetch/kill quests with little to no plot. Due to this all, the world feels more like it was built around the strong plotline. The dialogues have nice acting, but choices you make in them have almost no effect on the dialogue progression [spoiler]just like no action would have a significant effect in a cyberpunk world[/spoiler]. The worst part is, of course, that your background didn't matter at all. What i didn't like is that to learn more about the world you either have to to an IRL wiki to check on corporations/gangs/history etc, read through tons and tons of archived dialogues [b](why can't we use text-to speech while moving?)[/b] or radio hosts who have great lines, but you only can check them while driving, I really wanted more of those conspiracy-like news hosts, but while walking, why can't I adjust my holo chip for a radio frequency?

If you have a high-end PC you'll get the graphics it was meant to be seen. Sometimes the scenery gets really breathtaking and you simply stop to watch the sun go down in badlands. Night-City viewed from the badlands, or a toxic rain in the city are candy to the eye. Night City, like most of CP universes is best observed from afar, rather than from within. Why? Lots and lots of trash both literal and visual like ads. The attention to details really shows and helps to immerse in the game and feel like walking/riding streets of such a city. Music is nice, not as memorable, as Hotline Miami, but still nice. Extra points for the Grindcore/Death Metal radio.

[b]Final Thoughts[/b]: Once again, the game is good. It is fun, it is beautiful, and it is still far from shining. The best part - it shows enormous potential for further development, as it is closer to the digitization of a tabletop game, and the current version is more to show the development potential with a great main plot. For me it is more like what was Shadowrun: Returns to the whole trilogy afterwards, and the first one was kinda meh, but Dragonfall and Hong-Kong were very good. Hope it is also the case here. I will gladly wait for more DLCs and improvements for like a year and return to compare."
1609795917,"Great story, amazing characters. City detail is fantastic. Side missions are interesting and there are a lot of good quests. AI could be better during combat, also driving cars and bikes could give a better experience. (eg.: from the cockpit view sometimes you can not see the road very well) I do no like the code hacking method. Overall I think it is a great game, with an amazing and detailed world, story and characters. For me this is the most important aspect.

Only thing I've seen so far that I've been unhappy with some of the driving mechanics. I find its little clunky and a little overbearing but other then that, I enjoy this game a lot."
1609795765,"can't speak to the console experience, but on PC this game runs well if you throw relatively modern hardware at it.  ignore the recommendations, you need at least a 6700k and at least a 2060 to play this game with a respectable framerates."

1609795355,This game is freaking awesome!
1609795339,Very average game at best. The main story is interesting and there are some great characters. But once you finish the main story there's almost nothing to do. Side missions run out quickly and the world has nothing worth exploring. I have spent hours driving around visiting exclamation marks on the map and their pretty much all copy paste missions that you start and finish in the one area. Exploring is not worth it at all there isn't even areas that are interesting to explore despite all the high rise buildings. The world was advertised as this massive open world with all these gangs and factions and you end up barely interacting with any of them. The combat is slow and clunky and it gets repetitive quickly. Stealth isn't fun either with braindead AI and some bugs cause you to reload the game and lose progress. You also need a beefy computer to get decent performance. Their idea of minimum specs to play the game leaves you with like 30 fps. Its like a 5.5/10 at best.
1609795149,Amazing Game. Love it.

1609794068,"Its hard to believe the game is not nearly as good as Wild Hunt. A title that is 5 years old, and by the same developer...

How.

There is nothing to do, but grind and kill gangs. Its the same thing, every time, inside or outside of a task; Sneak up, shoot at, press x to stay alive, loot guns and junk, sell, repeat.

Character, clothing, weapons and vehicles = minimal to zero customisation.

There are so many simple mechanics that would have made the game great, but just aren't there.

Overall;
Repetitive, grindy, and a story that doesn't feel rewarding.

6/10"
1609793942,"fun, i enoyed the main story, very few bugs encountered but there are many."
1609793916,"great game, id recommend it"
1609793810,"If you are confident in your computer specs don't worry about the negative reviews.  Yes, lots of glitches at launch but nothing game breaking. I go back and forth between playing stealthy or guns blazing, very satisfying game play.  Story and side missions pull me in, I usually don't watch/read all of the dialogue but with this game I get into it.  Such a unique atmosphere, this really is an amazing game.

-Recommend playing at very hard mode to get the most out of this game.
-Get double jump as soon as possible- game changer.
-Don't break down iconic weapons, you can't re-craft them right now.
-Save often
"
1609793748,"Honestly, I think the game's really fun and worth playing. I understand the frustrations a lot of people have with it for sure, but if you've played something like Skyrim or Fallout NV, you're no stranger to the occasional floating NPC or weird bugged quest that's fixed with a simple reload like nothing happened. It's genuinely a ton of fun. It's no masterpiece of the RPG genre or anything like that, but it's definitely worth the time."
1609793724,Great game if you have the right graphics card using a rtx2080 game runs pretty smooth. You can tell content was cut from the final game but i say give this game till mid 2021 and everything should be fixed
1609793717,Good game I recommend it
1609793693,"Amazing game for anyone with a computer built after 2010, hate is all from people running this on their toaster. short storyline in my opinion and becomes extremely easy late game despite being on very hard."
1609793651,"Very good game, didn't get any gamebreaking bugs on my playthrough"
1609793649,...
1609793576,"Yes, there are bugs.  No, it will not run well on a low end PC.  If it runs well on your system this is one of (and possibly THE) finest single player RPGs ever created."
1609793576,"I think people complain to much, its an awesome game and super fun to play, i experienced very little bugs and no crashing"
1609793463,"I went into Cyberpunk 2077 almost completely blind (ignored all trailers and reveals once the game got announced and I knew I was probably going to get it).  I'm not sure if that helped me not buy into the ridiculous expectations people seemed to have, but I had an immense amount of fun during my time with Cyberpunk 2077.  The game is gorgeous (if you have the hardware to run it), the overall atmosphere the city is amazing, and some of the quests and characters are some of the most memorable of any game I have played.  I also found the combat to be very satisfying once I got my upgrade path figured out. Yes there are bugs (although all mine were essentially visual ones that made me laugh more then mad), and yes it requires some high end hardware to run right, but overall, this game is a strong recommend for me to anyone who believes they can run it."
1609793414,"Too many bugs, it's unbelievable the game actually came out in this state.
I wouldn't buy this unless you have at least a 50% sale on the full release price.
If they fix it, sure, but they have to fix pretty much the entire game."
1609793360,"A few glitches here and there, but otherwise a really fun and beautiful game, if you have an RTX capable video card anyway."
1609793261,лучше попейте пива на 2к
1609793171,"This game is certainly rough around the edges, but I've been enjoying it thoroughly."
1609793039,Very entertaining. Very fun. There are a few bugs here and there but definitely nothing that significantly affects the overall experience. Would definitely recommend the game.
1609792988,Yes.
1609792961,Definitely has potential. I'm in Act 2 when i wrote this and half of the cut scenes that have happened have glitched out. they stay on a certain frame while the audio continues or it is a black screen with audio. sometimes npc models don't load in until i stare at them for around 10 seconds. Same goes for vehicles. They definitely need to work on fixing the bugs.
1609792926,"It's a fantastic game, and I will be better with time. That being said, You need a midrange computer to enjoy it."
1609792900,"It's not perfect, there are plenty of area's that could use some improvement but I'm happy I purchased it and am having fun playing it. Something worth mentioning, Nexus already has some useful mods available and I'm willing to bet it wont be long before the modding community kicks into full swing."
1609792893,"Great game! Occasional bugs but luckily not as bad as on console. Graphics are amazing! about 90 to 100 FPS with at RTX 2070 HIgh Texture Low Shadow settings. No ray tracing if you want higher FPS. DLSS on auto if you have an RTX card. I thought the story was great and there's definitely many side missions. About 30 to 35 hrs for me to beat campaign, but alot of side stuff I can still do! Looking forward to more patches to make it even smoother. MAKE ALL SHADOW SETTINGS LOW FOR SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER FPS. Game still looks great as long as texture is on high!"
1609792798,story kept me engaged enough to see it through 2 of the endings. Once I have more time I'll try to play through others
1609792736,"The story makes up for any glitches, hands down! Absolutely beautiful game and story, certainly worth every minute spent on it. If you cry about it, write your own review and then take your pen and put it up your ass."
1609792707,it is very glitchy but fun none the less
1609797870,"Very enjoyable if a bit buggy. I played the launch versions of Skyrim and Fallout New Vegas on the PS3 so the bugs were peanuts to me.If you can handle a couple of quick save reloads you're in for a treat. I grew to love all the characters and found the combat to be a barrel of fun after the first few hours. I am a bit biased for the cyberpunk aesthetic as I grew up loving films/novels/comic books like Akira, Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, Robocop, Judge Dredd, Snow Crash, Neuromancer, The Fifth Element, and Total Recall, so playing an open world action RPG version of them was like a dream come true. If you love detailed worlds, fun secret side missions, and pages upon pages of lore then you're in for a treat, so many nooks and crannies to explore. The biggest flaw which they need to fix is that you can't double jump while a fixer is calling you. You'll be parkouring through the very vertical world, bounding across rooftops, feeling the wind in your face until Mr. Hands calls you with a job and SPLAT! Happened to me more than a dozen times. I don't care that the hacking puzzles were repetitive, I mean, have you ever played an RPG with fun hacking puzzles? Be honest. At least they're short. 

P.S. Cyberpunk 2077 has the deadliest explosive barrels in any game ever."
1609792497,good
1609792459,"First of all I totally recommend this game because i enjoyed every hour of it. The story is enjoyable and the gameplay is cool and never gets boring. The game runs smooth on high settings with medium ray tracing besides a few crashes and frame drops on a decent Pc (Rtx 2070, ryzen 7 1800x ,16gb ram, mk2 ssd) and looks gorgeous most of the time. Even the dreaded bugs werent as prominent as in any other AAA game nowadays. Now to the things that need improvent...
Most cars handle like trash sliding down a waterslide, the item system is really unbalanced: vendors are overpiced and useless, crafting is an unbalaced mess, upgrading is a pointless way to burn all your ressources, to get a decent set of matching/ good looking clothes is near impossible and weapon balancing flies out the window once you hit level 50 and level 20 in crafting. The storyline tries to simulate the ilusion of free choice and fails miserably most of the time, V sometimes suffers from generic badass syndrom and if you dont like silverhand he is still forced on you all the time because keanu is so wholesome i guess. I still would rate this game an 8/10"
1609792457,"I love this game, yes it has still a few bugs but past that is a stunning narrative story that you will create. I can very much recommend this game to everyone who has doubts about it"
1609792302,Magical.
1609792264,"I want to start off by saying what a wonderful game! It looks great, ran fine on my computer and I would recommend this to others! Has a great story, tons to do and so much more!
The game looks beautiful and I couldn't ask for more! Keanu Reeves was right when he said ""Breathtaking"" because it truly is a breathtaking game!"
1609792232,"Yes, the game is buggy and your mileage may vary. But I had a blast playing this game and the story was outstanding albeit short. If you purchase the game now it'll be funny but be prepared for a few hiccups on your adventure, this game will just get better the longer you wait."
1609792160,"fun game
"
1609792028,my pc has no lag lol
1609792017,"Absolutely would recommend on a higher end PC. This game is truly something special and it makes me sad to think it could have been the legendary game it was destined to be if consumers did not pressure CDPR to the extent that they did. The visuals are incredible and paired with a genuinely good story this also could have been one of or possibly even the best game of 2020. I really hope that at least over time the game can get to where the devs intended for it to be and more people can have the same breathtaking experience I did while playing.

Anyways with that being said here's my glitch video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuuUvJSgt0g"
1609791931,"Despite what everyone is saying negatively about the game I rather enjoy it. Yes, there are some bugs.. who cares. Lots of games have bugs. I just grow up loving the cyberpunk and Neo-tokyo themes."
1609792452,"[h1]Beautiful, but empty.[/h1]

[b]Spoilers, both minor and major, in dark spoiler boxes.[/b]

Beautiful, but empty. Not to mention bug riddled, and terribly performing on last gen consoles. There's traces of passion but nothing to keep you coming back. Not to mention [spoiler]the endings are depressing,[/spoiler] romance isn't fleshed out, the AI needs serious improvement, etc. It's good for 60 hours of your time then after that it becomes a slog. Too easy at times, even on harder difficulties. [spoiler]Even in the endings[/spoiler] I saw glitches that took me out of the moment and made me wonder if they play tested this at all before they shipped it out.

I played Cyberpunk 2077 from launch, excited for a breath of fresh air. I got a game that reminded me of every other like it. It's just not ground breaking, nothing that's so special I choose that game out of any other to play. They boasted character customization, and your choices mattering, but both are mediocre. [spoiler]The endings are set in stone and are only influenced by quests.[/spoiler] Your choices, ultimately, don't change anything. The character customization is mediocre at best, and just because I can choose between big schlong and average schlong doesn't mean I can make my character look like a unique person.

I can tell you, I enjoyed certain aspects of the story before it got to the endings. It did keep me playing where otherwise I would have uninstalled it and left it to rot, like I did after the ending. The fact that I played for a full 60 hours boasts its ability to tell a story that keeps you hooked. I didn't stealth a single mission, but my brother tells me stealth is a good mechanic in the game. The driving is slippery, but not too badly designed for what it is. The AI seems directly taken from a Grand Theft Auto game, and that's not a good thing. I, like many others, believe that this game should have been delayed for at least another year to iron out the fine details and add in mechanics that are needed.

You can tell they built a beautiful shell, wrote great stories, voiced great dialogue, but filled it with mediocre gameplay. If this was a walking simulator where I roleplayed as V and didn't have to gun down anything, it wouldn't feel much different. The side gigs, which I didn't focus on as much as my brother did (he bought me the game, but on my account so I won't check it as I received it for free), are entertaining enough for side content.

[b]Major spoilers for those interested[/b] - [spoiler]All the endings, including the secret one obtained by having a high relation with Johnny, end with V only having 6 months left to live. The only difference in one ending is Johnny having control of the body. It feels miserable. I love a good sad ending but for all your choices to end pessimistically? It just leaves a bad feeling in your stomach. Bad endings should be the result of bad choices. Your choices add up to picking the ending you want to see, not the direct result of what you've done and said throughout the game. Minor choices change minor things, but there are no definitive 'Major' choices I can pick out. The idea of V's engram and not the original V being in V's body is very interesting, and could have been explored further, but it's just left there. I also understand the idea of a dark, unforgiving setting resulting in a dark, unforgiving future for the main character, but all I'm saying is it could have been handled a bit differently, instead of being so open ended. It feels like a very obvious cliffhanger for DLC or a sequel to pick up on.[/spoiler]

You need to play the game at least for ten hours yourself to form your own opinion. This may sound defeatist in all, but there are some serious positives to the game worth checking out. It's not worth 60 dollars, in my opinion it's worth 20 dollars in its current state, so I'd wait for it to go on sale then pick it up yourself. If you want a new game to play with a good story, it can't hurt to pick this one up. If you decide to pass on it seeing the bad reviews/general disappointment, you won't be missing out on something spectacular. Just another shooter with pretty graphics."
1609791830,
1609791714,"I would not recommend this game right now, until they fix most of the dumb mechanics and bugs, can't enjoy doing dumb stuff like killing peds or fighting cops since the damn cops just use instant transmission and kill you in one hit or if you try to escape them by car some how cars in the future blow up after taking 5 bullets.
The game is not enjoyable what you would likely just be doing is trying to complete the repetitive side quest and most likely using a sniper since most of the enemies will be above your level and every other gun is so weak when fighting them that you need to play the peek a boo game with them if you don't want to die instantly.

most cars feel so bad to drive it feels like I'm controlling the horse from the witcher 3 and motorcycles are just bad to use, it's drift day for them if you want to simply take a 90 degree turn and my lord cars and motorcycles do not want to break to turn at all, if you want to break and turn at the same time well too bad since for some reason you can't do either of them efficiently while doing both actions so you only have the hand break to use and if it's not some what of the better cars you're just gonna end up doing a 180 and needing to correct your directions."
1609791690,super epic
1609791578,Pretty cool concept and I really like the open world could be a little more detailed in what you can pick up comparable to skyrim. The main thing I didnt like is that you pretty much need a top notch PC to play without multiple lag or glitch issues.
1609791529,Buggy. Hoped for decent story and side quests but everything is too simple and straightforward.
1609791513,"Cyberpunk is a fantastic disappointment.  I say that because it came so close to taking the mantra of 'Greatest of all Time' for me.  It is still buggy, even after almost a month after release.  Most of the bugs are minor, but a few do get in the way of enjoyment.  The content is good, but not great.  The open world is absolutely amazing.  CDPR has created a seminal achievement in open world RPG gaming, kudos to them.  Bethesda, you have some real competition here.

I have over 200 hours now across two playthroughs.  I love parts of them game: the open world, the combat, the skill system, the crafting, the loot system.  I hate certain parts of the game: braindances, lengthy cut-scenes that last for far too long, the bugs.  And there are parts of the game that are simply medicore.

If you love open world RPGs this is your game.  It does have a fair amount of hypersexualized content, so if that bothers you, you might want to reconsider.  It is a 7/10.  It's too bad, it could have been sublime."
1609791499,bad controls for the car and game play
1609791580,"I was wait some time for this game to release and was extremely excited to have it, but there are way too many glitches in the game. I wouldn't really recommend anyone to buy full price so people don't repeat my mistake. wait unit its like above 50% off or free, I am still playing this because I don't have anything else to play since I recently move from console to PC."
1609791467,fun
1609791407,I would say cyberpunk 2077 is a great game with lots of potential I would definitely recommend it to my friends and I have. There is still lots of work to be done to make it the best most immersive game out there but I think if CDPR listens to the community cyberpunk will surpass all expectations.
1609791373,game
1609791293,Buggy but i still Burn City
1609791255,"I can't say I do not love the Cyberpunk world. 7/10 for 200 plus hours of game play. In beginning I had nothing negative to say but felt like going to the amusement park and 3/4 the rides are closed. A lot Passion and creativity is really shown, its a shame that there were so much more that was cut out. I would have waited double or triple the time for this game.

I do find it comical how the game seemed to be ruined by the ""Corp"" mindset. I wish it was a better foundation for the world. Maybe better finished, or at least not another example of what seems to be plaguing video game companies in general.

Trailer to Game, should always have improvement, not cut backs."
1609791038,"Magnificent story
Wasted potential of being a new GTA
Gotta reload the saves many time to finish the missions
But after all, good game"
1609790917,10 anos pra sair isso...
1609790906,"While I was playing game, i did not felt anything special about the game in terms of story or mechanics but the environment of the game and the characters made this game so much fun to play. 
personally, I think this game is worth playing. 7/10"
1609790793,Has some bugs here and there but so far nothing game breaking for me at least. I think a good chunk of the problems with this game are on console. That aside its a game you can sink a LOT of hours into.
1609790687,"Not too bad if you like futuristic settings. If you have anything under gtx 1080 or similar don't buy it yet. As you may have learned, game is plagued with bugs so waiting for some updates to fix gameplay."
1609790408,Absolutely amazing!!!!!
1609790325,"great game dont care if its glitchy for last gen console peasants
"
1609790156,"I'm saving super often in multiple slots just in case. seeing glitches constantly, but its still fun and i know updates will make this run smoother."
1609790013,"Its good, just not as great as we thought"
1609789748,"I love the game in and out. That being said like with all lovers, they have good and bad things about them. And like with all love it's sometimes worth to wait.

The gameplay is great. The guns feel amazing to shoot, and though the AI is not very smart You still will die a bunch (there are some cheesy builds that let You become invincible, but most likely You wont want to be building them). The hacking feels great, the stealth feels like a good puzzle.

The quests are awesome, they never feel like fetch quests especially since You can almost always fast-travel to the destination. You have something to say in them most of the time. They just feel good.

The story and the characters feel as authentic as in the movie. Pretty much as authentic as far cry 4. The character development and how the characters respond to Your decisions is also pretty authentic. And this is something that's of great value in this game.

Cars and all around level design is pretty good. There are always at least a few paths to victory. Some are level-restricted, but theyre always present.

Shortcomings...

Crafting system - pretty much obsolete unless You get to 16 level, at which point it will allow You to recycle mods, which is pretty powerful. Upgrading items is too costly and upgrading a few levels of legendary item will cost You all the parts You make throughout the game, and they are very costly. Inability to craft multiple items is also very annoying, because You can find Yourself clicking away a few hundred times. Thank god there is a fix for having to hold a button for 0.8s for every item.

Inventory management. Would be bearable if not the refreshing and gliches.

Stealth it works and is fun, but You'll find yourself reloading a lot because of a few issues with bodies and alert behavior.

All around bugs. There are a ton, but honestly considering the size of the game and that it's the first game of the kind for the company it's not that bad. There are a lot of immersion breaking bugs, but nothing that will keep You from progressing. I'd recommend waiting for a few patches before getting the game."
1609789503,"don't listen to what other people have been saying. the game has been great so far, get and try it out and decide for yourself"
1609789500,"It is a very solid 7/10. Story is cool, characters are great, voice acting is phenomenal sometimes, and serviceable others. Combat ranges from great to mindnumbingly boring depending on how you approach it. Stay behind cover and play it like call of duty? Have fun lol. Balls to the walls with cybernetic upgrades, in everyone's faces doing massive crit damage with your arm swords and stupidly overpowered revolver? Now that's more like it. Unfortunately, however, the next gen open world, and freedom of choice (THE TWO MAIN SELLING POINTS ON THIS GAME FROM THE TRAILERS) are practically absent. Open world is pretty much dead, and the police system is braindead, while the choices you make outside of sidequests never really mean anything until the very, and I mean V E R Y end. Looks great, build variety is nice, but the game is kind of shallow.  Where I live, the game is worth 30 dollars on steam which is about what I would recommend anyone pay for it."
1609789761,"Are you familiar with the term ""Flawed masterpiece""?
Cuz if you aren't, you'll certainly be when you have played this game.

This game has it all, an amazing story with multiple endings, great VO's, and enough stuff to easily be entertained for at least 100 hours. Just a shame that the game got rushed despite 7+ years of development.

I was lucky enough to not be greeted with all too many bugs, with just some occasional ones that at their worst only were immersion-breaking or randomly dying. Due to this reason, the bugs were no major issue and didn't ruin the gameplay all too much.

All in all, it's an amazing game that I think every RPG/FPS-fan out there should play.

Without bugs - 9/10
With bugs      - 7-8/10 (Depending on the severity of the bug)

EDIT:
Small correction"
1609789113,it good
1609790697,"Just finished this masterpiece.

Such an amazing story, well-made compelling characters, some of which evolve as you advance, totally changing your perspective on 'em. A huge load of secondary quests, with varying levels of depth, and of course lots of random activities to do around. The graphics are stunning in PC, I'm really sorry for those console players than can't really enjoy this beast of a game, hopefully CDPR will fix that side of things.

So much attention to detail has been put into creating Night City, even with all the bugs and weirdness that usually come with open-world games. Yeah, it definetly needs a coat of paint, bug bashing, maybe a couple additions to gameplay...

But this game made me look so forward to future DLC's and content... you will know once you beat it!"
1609788918,"I played nearly 200 hours of this game. First 50ish was on GoG version, rest was on steam.
One would ask, is this game good? Did you like it? Did you had fun?
There is no simple answer for those questions. On one hand i got angry reviewers, tons of bugs and glitches on youtube mostly recorded on PS4 or Xbox. On the other hand I got this game on my old PC, barely getting 40fps, but with amazing story.
Main question is, did i had fun? FCKING YES! Did i like the story? YES! YES! Did I want to go back to this game instead of spending time with my wife watching shitty romantic series on TV? YES! YES! YES!
At first, I will say my PC is old, I will buy new one probably in about a year or two, but right now my wife would kill me, if I spend 2000 USD on PC hardware. Can I afford it without any issues? Yes...but i have a second brain called my wife, and she doesn't like to spend anything on computers. If i would buy clothes for her for that price, then I would be amazing husband, but PC? Fck no! Are you crazy. So...my PC is old. I got I7 4770, 16GB of DDR3 RAM and GTX 970 OC not overclocked. My video setting in this game are medium/high with some crappy shit turned off or on low. Game still looks good. Not amazing, but very good. My FPS is around 30-35, but sometimes it drops to around 19 at night, with a specific lights on. Especially when I drive my car or when I shoot people. Is it happens often? NO. Is it annoying? Well, im old enough to play on amiga and commodore to be not annoyed anymore by lagging. But, NO. You cannot see it that often, so hardwise, this game needs more optimalization. Will guys from CD projekt do it? I don't think so. They might fix it a bit, but I think that is what this engine can do, and you would need to optimize the engine. Let's get back to the main thing in the game. THE STORY. Do I like the story? IT is AMAZING. The main story of this game is like a movie, it is pretty damn good and I loved it. That is my opinion. You might not like it. I loved it. In most cases I play games for 2 days and I'm done, I finish the main story, and in most cases I just want to finish it, because I am bored till then. But here, I was actually doing side missions, because I did not want this story to finish. I wanted to do more, I did not want to finish, but I had to, because there was no side missions anymore for me. Well there was one, but it is bugged, and it doesn't start...plase fix that CD Projekt. You can call me a fan of CD Projekt but I am not. I did not play witcher till the end. Can't remember why. I tried it twice, at second try, I really went far, but still got bored. Funny story, I worked for a company, that had office next to CD Projekt Red in Krakow. I remember when I came to office at winter, it was still dark because I was always first at office. But I was walking next to their building/office, and I saw their empty chairs waiting. It was still dark, and it was very quiet and calm. When I finished my shift, I was going back to my car to drive to home, and developers were sitting at their desks, probably doing some stuff for Witcher 3. It was dark outside, and no one had light on at their office. Only monitor screens were lit. Ok End of story. It sounded better in my brain, than on paper.
Main question is: should you buy this game for you? In my opinion YES you should.
Will  you like it? I don't know. I did. You might hate it, but you probably won't hate it, and you will have fun as long as your computer is newer than mine xD
Do I think this game is not finished? No. This game is finished, but it doesn't deliver all, they said it will.
This game will have bugs, it will have optimalization lacking, it will have some game breaking bugs(i only saw 2 for side missions), but if were just waiting for a new game, and never checked for trailers, hype shit etc. you will be happy, to play this game. I would love to play it again, but im waiting for more patches. I finished it btw, but I feel like I want more.
Some words for devs if they will ever see it:
Chłopaki i dziewczyny, jeśli to czytacie, to gra wyszła super. Trzeba było jeszcze trochę poczekać na poprawę bugów i powinniście się słuchać bardziej QA, ale nadal gra jest super. Skupcie się teraz na poprawie optymalizacji i błedach, żeby świat widział, że Polska potrafi. Wierzę w was i nie martwcie się. Dobra robota."
1609788903,ok
1609975365,"Oversold it like fuck, bit shit rn - hopefully they turn it around though as there's potential.

1609974596,"[h1]What The Fuck[/h1] 
not is good as everyone says it is from the time i played it, I wish i could play more but the game wont even open and I've  done everything but nope. So what the fuck"
1609805491,"Definitely yes. Even though there are more than a few bugs/gliches, everything is fixed with a reload of a save or restart of the game. I finished the main story, most of the sidequests and 100% achievements and I can say the game is definitely finished and playable. Amazing graphics, awesome soundtrack, a well written story, not only the main story but most of the sidequests and not the least the diversity of Cyberpunk 2077 that is mind-blowing."
1609788537,This is what happens when you blow up your development budget on cocaine and hookers
1609788535,Why do I get to chose the worst ending?
1609788514,Made me Cyberspunk
1609788500,Good game I guess
1609788340,"It's got its problems, but the core game is good."
1609788328,Good game. Shame about the PC exclusivity though.
1609788242,An unfinished game filled with bugs and murdered by its infinite hype and the fanbase's impossible expectations
1609788145,Johnny Silverhand a Cyberpunk Story. Your choices are not really all that important. Game world is not interactive and feels lifeless compared to much older game titles. I am not a Cyberpunk fan and had no expectations of this game other than expecting a RPG experience where my choices matter and what I got was a narrative railroad. It is not a bad game by any means the core game play can be really fun at times but the ending was very frustrating to me. I will probably not play through this game again because there is just nothing there. I cannot play my character after the ending to see how the world changes based on my decisions and babysitting a douche-canoe Keanu Reeves just doesn't really appeal all that much. This game is really about Keanu Reeves and not the player.
1609788124,"Cyberpunk 2077 is excellent.  I am 80+ hours in and have had minimal issues technically.  It has excellent writing; tons of side quests and stories - all written far superior to similar games.  The world is vibrant and alive - as long as you remember that the city is the world - so many buildings won't be accessible (just like in Boston, Fallout 4) but many are open for quests/stories.  Quite frankly many held this game to impossible expectations.  It is by far one of the better games I've played in this genre."
1609975476,Great game ! Lots of fun ! The map design is beautiful 15 hours into the game and im still impressed by it! Laugh at the small glitches
1609787863,"Excellent story, visuals and music. There's so much John Wick from Fortnite in this game and it's great."
1609787765,just ignore the press . it really good game with story
1609787703,neat
1609787424,"A great game with a great concept, didn't quite reach its potential. Thoroughly enjoyed playing it through and only encountered a few minor bugs at release which were swiftly fixed. I occasionally die falling down a curb still, but I'm okay with that. I found they put too much emphasis on some of the smaller aspects (Shards, emails on PC etc) when some of the larger aspects felt slightly lacking.
After playing several quests through multiple times, I found most of my choices just didn't matter and felt empty. In fact the only relevant choices seemed to be how to bang someone and the ending. Besides that it all feels pretty scripted. 
I had interesting side quests cut off abruptly whilst never hearing about them again, pursuing a 'serious relationship' but can't actually DO anything with them beyond bang them the one time. They put so much detail into character customisation but once you've completed it you can't change anything (hair/nails/face etc). 
They let you choose your genitals in great detail to the point of wanting a small/large, circumcised penis. I'm not a deviant but why make the choices so vast if you don't even get to see penetration? I've been walking around all game with a heart shape shaved into my nether regions and I can't even get a glimpse during intimacy. Why you would purposely over-sexualise a game and then give PG13 sex scenes is beyond me."
1609787411,"This game needs another year or two at best.  Its an e(arly)a(ccess) game for sure so buy with a grain of salt.  I compare it often to Saints Row 2, and more frequently SR2 is the better game. There is just so much wrong with this game (see screen shots), that it shouldn't happen for a AAA title. Maybe in '22 itll be complete..."
1609787323,"Not without its bugs. Some points seriously frustrating. Bugs aside. Great art, lotsa fun to be had. Loads of side gigs and things to explore."
1609787288,"This is my favorite game, insane detail to the world, love it!!! Lots of fun."
1609792257,had to delete my nvidia drivers and reinstall so im a bit confused... but it launched
1609787150,"Cyberpunk 2077 has earned somewhat of a bad reputation for bugs/glitches, however it defintely does not disappoint in terms of immersion in Night City's story. I'm glad I picked this game up, I will continue to support CDPR just as I have Bethesda and other developers whom have had less than optimal game launches. Looking forward to the release of new content. 👍"
1609787118,"People should stop trash talking this game, its excellent and will keep improving"
1609787068,"Cyberpunk is a very unique game set in a very common theme;
Massively open world to explore, plenty to do, enemies to kill, people to meet and choices to make.

Where the game truly shines is exactly how it goes about doing those few things. at the time of writing, I have 36 hours ingame. Normally when playing a game like this I tend to go through the main story, doing just enough side gigs to have a relevant power level and then explore after the ""big bad"" has been dealt with.

Cyberpunk was a bit of a different beast, I started the game, had no idea what i was doing in all honesty and completed the first chapter before even realising what i had done. Only after *insert drastic event* had i realised. This did NOT happen because I was being lazy and not bothering to look around me, this happened because I was truly engrossed with the story thus far, I genuinely wanted to see what happened next, genuinely wanted to see what choices I could make and HOW those choices could play out.

But you aren't here for my entire step by step experience with every mission and every fight the game offered me, so in short(ish);

Massive Open-World to explore;
The game plays primarily in Night City (or just on its outskirts) and not ONCE did the city feel dead/boring or just procedurally generated. The crowds felt normal and alive, all while the visual aesthetic of the buildings/streets only proves what the narrative/opinion of the people in the city is trying to push or say. Now enough with ""looks"" and ""feels""; what is actually out there? Moving between the different districts will open new missions, new cars you can purchase, you will talk with and meet new NPCs who want to make use of your expertise. There are also quite a few missions that you can find simply by exploring the area you are in, whether its a ""you will see when you get there"" mission, or a gang that decided to make some trouble, there is plenty of content outside of the normal side missions/main missions.

Plenty to do;
Earlier i mentioned side missions, now in Cyberpunk 2077 there are a lot more than just ""side missions"" or random gang encounters, one of the things I enjoyed the most was that , apart from someone you know or the main story mission, there was also the opportunity to push your... ""career"" so to say by taking ""gigs"" from various fixers (the people in night city who gives you and others like you work opportunities), these gigs often lead to other gigs and more often then not give you great street cred (think of your notoriety) witch allows you to pick up even more side missions. I know there would be a few people annoyed with me not mentioning this, so I will. In Cyberpunk 2077 there are a fairly substantial amount of cars you can purchase (and call to your side at almost any time) and every single one that I have acquired thus far, feel unique to me. Now the reason this is such a big time sink for many is because there also exists a ""photo"" mode, where you can take a very good looking screenshot after having your character pose. There is quite a substantial amount of people I know who have spent a LOT of time in taking the perfect screenshot of their character with the perfect car with the perfect sunset.

Enemies to kill;
Enemies in Cyberpunk range from mouth breathing psychopaths that would be truly at home in Borderlands, all the way to flying drones and ultra decked out cyborgs with almost no faces, in fact, in some cases those cyborgs ARE the psychopaths . Now killing the enemies are also very fun, and yes, snipers are blatantly overpowered alongside shotguns, just because it says ""300 dps"" doesn't mean it will do 300 damage in a single hit. Now one might look at that sentence and go ""AHA THEY f#@KED UP!"". Well, yes, but actually no. You see, Cyberpunk 2077's combat is not nearly as limited to ""bullet go pew pew"", as people with high Int rating in the game will no doubt agree, while clearing entire buildings of enemies with the press of a single button. What truly makes Cyberpunk 2077 combat amazing in my opinion, is the way it handles its melee system. I'm sure many who are here have seen the videos of people with blades coming out of their arms and yes it is as strong as it looks, you effectively become a blender, but that does not mean that to be proficient in ranged combat, you cannot use melee weaponry at all. You see, in the game, melee weapons tend to have fairly crazy stats. I found a legendary pistol that dealt 260 damage, only to immediately find a sword that does 450 damage. This is NOT a broken system, every melee is stronger than its relevant ranged counterpart and I, personally, adore this. It means that combat is never stale, its never the same and if I really don't like that specific hairstyle, I have the means to help the wearer change it. The biggest thing I like about this; To be proficient in melee, I dont need to spend all my talent/attribute points in it. I can simply have a good melee, and be perfectly capable. 

People to meet and choices to make;
It may seem that to me Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that is all about the combat, all about the healthbars dropping and seeing big numbers after making the enemies head vanish due to a big boom from a sniper rifle. I am sorry, but for me that is not the case. The characters that was put into the game by CDPR is just phenomenal, one of the first characters you meet seems to be nothing more than a copy paste of ""insert generic npc here"" and yet with every mission, with every piece of dialogue you uncover more and more layers, you discover more and more of what drives that character, of why that character is in that situation in the first place. The truly well executed part of the method of character building Cyberpunk 2077 uses is the why they use characters to grow other characters, a good example is right at the end of the game when you reunite with an earlier character and it truly drives home what was most important to the character, how this one ideal was what the character clung to. And with context, it hurt me right in the feels. For me, the most fun part of Cyberpunk was  meeting and dealing/helping/talking to the different NPC's. There isn't much to explain in the sense that choices matter, since to explain in depth would lead to some major spoilers, but basically certain dialogue choices matter, and what you choose NOT to say can also have a large impact, both in terms of how certain missions will play out and in terms of your own understanding on the Cyberpunk 2077 universe/understanding of the character you are talking to.

This game is by NO means perfect.
The best way i can describe this game is the skeleton of something perfect.
It has the correct bone structure, it even has a few organs with the most important ones in place (brain, heart etc). It needs the muscle, the sinew and although it has some blood, it needs more.
I feel that there is too little interaction with most npcs, both major and minor. The only times one really interacts is when you have a mission with them. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, but not having small events (like inviting your love interest for coffee or a date or inviting your friend over to go out and fight against baddies) really hurts the character building/growth for both the NPC and the player simply because it reduces the flat amount there is. I believe that mainly this is a content issue that may exists due to the publishers wanting to push the game out too early.
And on that note, the game was obviously pushed out too early. There are numerous physics glitches, clipping issues and what appears to be band aids used to hold certain things together, for example I had a bug where a door would not open and forced me to reload a SPECIFIC auto save to undo the save engine bugging the NPC that is supposed to open the door.
this game is not 10/10 but it can, without a doubt, become 10/10 if the publisher allows the devs to do their incredible magic.
7.3/10 atm."
1609786971,"ok so ima do this short 
Story is pretty good like really good it has really good characters and a really good plot
side missions are really good as well it got me hooked
bugs is minus 
combat is meh in my opinion the most fun guns were the revolvers not the AR's they are really boring
if i had to give a rating it would be 9/10"
1609786815,This is actually a good game.
1609786706,"I don't care if there are some game breaking bugs, game is awesome, characters are amazing and the storyline is phenomenal."
1609786643,"No momento, mt bom (ainda n zerei). História zika, gráficos (qnd é bonito), personagens, dublagem, poxa várias coisas são ótimas e nem sei por onde começar.
Honestamente, eu estou pouco me fohdendo para os bugs. Na vdd eles dxam o jogo ainda mais engraçado dependendo da ocasião. Se vc tmb n se importa pelos glitches, vc vai amar este jogo tmb.
Porém até a otimização de PC poderia ser melhor. F para tds os usuários de ps4."
1609786631,"Does this game have bugs? Sure it does. But they aren't as bad as everyone makes them out to be. I have 74 hours into the game at the time of writing this, and I can count on one hand the times I've had to restart or quit because of a bug. CDPR is working to make this the game it should have been at launch and with free DLC about to start dropping, this game is only going to get better and better. Buy it, play it, love it. It's a solid game."
1609786577,game is full of gross sexual imagery and sounds.  It would maybe be a fun game if you weren't assaulted with blatant sexual immorality the entire time.
1609786575,"Same masterpiece as The Witcher games, except for bugs of course. BUT.......come on, just give them chance to fix the game. Overall it is truly BREATHTAKING."
1609786606,"Nowhere near as immersive as GTAV or Witcher 3. Main story is short and game has too many bugs. Not recommended, because its not worth 60€ as of now. Overall a fun game still. Wait for discount and bug fixes."
1609786526,"30 minutes of playtime, all those minutes me trying to open the game"
1609786510,"Overall enjoying the game so far. Combat is fun and different. I've run into scenarios where I absolutely demolish enemies and scenarios where I need strategize in order to come out alive. The challenge is there regardless of what build you have. I have the combat set to higher difficulty which provided more challenges. 

Look I know it has some bugs, but nothing game breaking for me. It is like any other RPG in the past where you need to follow some rules just in case. Such as manual saving here and there to have some good restore points in case of something going wrong. I was lucky to not have any weird glitches and hopefully I am not jinxing myself here, but I do recommend multiple saves just in case."
1609786507,"So if you can get the game working, and get lucky enough to not encounter a ton of bugs then this game is amazing. The gun play is fun, the world building is beyond words, and the quest are very fun.  The graphics are great, it has smut which I hate to say I enjoy in games, and the story telling is awesome! Plus there is tons of stuff to do in the game. I can't wait for them to get this game ironed out into the finished product that it should have been at launch. 7/10 stars right now and only that low because of the bugs."
1609872175,"Crashes every 30 min or so. Do not recommend the game in it's current state. Although the story and gameplay are legit, crashing to desktop a few times per hours, makes everything else pointless.

Correction.. it now crashes every 10 mins or less :)

UPDATE: the game seems to be working fine on GeforceNow. No crashes or other issues."
1609786333,Very cool
1609786216,Don't Listen the haters. The game is great and it is only gonna get better with updates.
1609786039,wait for a sale though
1609786025,Do not buy yet. Wait for a couple of years until they fix this buggy game.
1609785883,"Game is very fun, but there have been bugs/glitches that do ruin the feel of the game at times. if you have a decent enough PC, you should have a good time running this game. Worth the $60, but it's not the best game ever like some people wanted."
1609785813,1
1609785810,expected more
1609785803,"The game is very deep and rich if you can look past the bugs. Games of this scope tend to be riddled with bugs but they are my favourite games to play because of the depth of the characters and ""lore"". Give it a chance if you enjoyed games like Skyrim, Witcher 3, Fallout, Farcry etc. I'm eagerly looking forward to the upcoming DLC!"
1609785764,"Let's start with what everyone knows: YES it has bugs and YES it isn't all that CDPRED promised.

Now that that is out of the way. The game is enjoyable, and fun to play. I'm having a blast learning the history of NC and its inhabitants. The storyline is amazingly writen, and the characters are unique. The gameplay isn't bad, but it isn't great I'll be honest. At about level 15 I was already one shoting every enemy with my Pistol Stealth build on Hard (not Very Hard yet). But that aside, I enjoy the perks, the attributes, the cyberware and quickhacks. The game feels like it's suppose to feel, and if you complain about framerate just lower some graphics... not all games need to played at Max ;)

TL;DR - If you enjoy shooty sci-fi future games, get it. If you hate to wait for bug fixes, don't get it."
1609785595,"great game, not all what was expected but no serious bugs or crashes on my system. now its waiting for the dlcs."
1609785565,The large amount of good things do a good job at making you forget about the large amount of bad things.
1609785543,"Even bugs and glitches aside the game is not really worth the hype,If you think about it the game in the reveal and stuff was way different and way better,Something clearly went wrong that lead to this mess of a game,I really think CDPR wasn't planning to release this state of game they were clearly in some trouble that caused to this unfinished game,I hope CDPR keep working on it till its perfect one day and that day we can expect a game close to or even better rpg then the witcher 3"
1609785516,"besides a few bugs common to any new release, it is a gem, easy controls, great story, multiple paths so you get replay value. in game the weapons and traits allow you to customize your character, the ability to upgrade them give you even more versatility."
1609785475,"what else can you ask for... its cyberbug. I waited to hit 50 hours before giving my review and tbh i actually love this game its pretty rad. the scenes are gorgeous, the kills are amazing, and the hidden niches here and there are great. and if you want my unpopular opinion the occasional bugs make it hilarious. ive had VERY few problems with this game tbh."
1609785231,The best early access game I have ever played.
1609785060,"Despite the occasional bugs which frankly don't appear anymore since the patches, this game has been a fun experience."
1609784917,It's got a lot of issues but I'd still say it's fun to play.
1609784719,one of those games that you can spend hours doing one thing for one stat for one mission etc and i love it! its definitely a heavy load game tho i have a 1060 i7 an have to run on the lowish side for decent frames that being said the game still looks sexy idk about consoles tho.
1609784598,It has its's bugs but it's pretty fun.
1609784574,"Remember:
Angel (Male)
Skye (Female)"
1609784439,egg
1609784241,Many bugs but the game is really good!
1609784190,"An incredibly amount was promised and not delivered, many features in the game play trailer are not there. A.I. is incredibly basic and falls behind games released years before this one,  such as the gta series and even their own games such as the witcher 3. Looks wise this game is incredible, looks amazing and the story is great. Gunplay, game stability, A.I, and much more is incredibly basic and boring. I'm too lazy to write more but watch Beatemup's review on the game."
1609784146,"Yes there are lots of bugs, and yes there are features missing that was communicated in the marketing hype....but this is still such a cool world to explore! Thanks to the creators that put their hearts in this. No doubt, the game will get better with age. I've been gaming for 30+ years, so I've seen how far the medium has gone. Not the greatest game of all-time, but since when was that the only goal? This is a blast!"
1609784107,"Its fun, on PC at any rate. There are a lot of mechanics that have not been fleshed out and are simply window dressing. Breaching And Hacking being one of them, it is simply much easier to go in guns blazing, and with Panam's rifle you can 'Nuke Em from Orbit', and finish everyone else with legendary mantis blades that you pick up for free.

Reminds me a lot of Rage 2. Just so much stuff is not necessary to play and succeed.

The scope of this game is mind boggling, it is simply vast, detailed, gorgeous to look at and marvel at, credit to the development team, and a punch in the nuts to the stuffed shirts that wanted to cash in. Game needs another year of balances and polishing."
1609784086,"great experience, great story, can't wait for dlc
"
1609783927,very nice game
1609783907,The game is not great. GTA5 was a better game than this and that was a last gen game. I hope CD PROJEKT RED will figure out how to fix the story line and all the bugs that are in the game. If CD PROJEKT RED sees this I want my money back.
1609783876,"There's a reason why Projektred's investors have filed a class action lawsuit against them over this game. And why Sony has dropped cyberpunk 2077 from its store.- this game is a complete rip off. And steam is screrwing their customers by false metrics measuring time played. I played for an hour and somehow that became 16 hours to steam.

I'm going to find a class action lawyer and then I'm going to sue steam

"
1609783699,A+
1609783578,"my computer runs cyberpunk pretty well, but if you don't have the hardware i don't know how well it will run. the game is fun to play it tries to railroad you through the main story.  the custom ability of your character is wide and the variety of mods makes it replayable. i would give it a 7/10. im sure that as they fix bugs it will go up but for now as is a 7 is what i can give it."
1609783464,Not as great as advertised but still a really good game.
1609784367,"Corpo - Very Hard - Level 50 Completed all side quests and beat all the games achievement endings (did not do 2 of the 6 endings)

TLDR: Game is good, just buggy. Don't mind bugs? Buy it. If not wait. Also be careful to not do all the Gigs/NCPD stuff right away.

Game is amazing and if you have played Skyrim since day one you'll know the experience of an open world with a fuck ton of glitches. If you want to play it glitchless then I'd wait a bit. 

This game has a lot of customizability, with the branching dialogue paths, and three differing origins I very much believe I did not see it all. So if you like games where you get to experiment with builds then you will have fun. The world is wide and there is a lot to do. It's a game where you can spend hours exploring  the various districts while dealing the various problems that pop up on your minimap. Its definitely fun when you finish Act 1 and have Silverhand with you commenting on all the different parts of the city.

However a problem with the game I have is the Gigs seem to heavily favour stealth based builds, with bonuses that are only unlocked by doing the gig without being detected. As well as the core game loop being Side Quests required a player to wait a couple days/do a couple gigs. Which can be a problem for a player who completed all the NCPD/GIGs in the game before tackling the Side Quests. It was more apparent once you get into Act 3 when more NPC's appear to give out new side questlines."
1609783286,not enough kissing once again 7/10
1609783221,Needs quite a bit of re-doing in order to be enjoyable.
1609783800,"FYI I am demanding a refund from Steam after I finish this review.  We’ll see how that goes.

This game is NOT what was promised in the trailers - which by the way, are full of as many lies as Todd Howard speeches.

-Narrative choices don’t matter.
-Combat is broken, poorly balanced, and unfun.
-Can just melee stunlock and headshot everything even on the very hard difficulty.
-Looting is like ‘shitty borderlands diablo-guns’ meets ‘Fallout 76 weight management.’
-The feeling of constantly looking like a clownsuit because of the shitty armor system.
-Terrible enemy and NPC AI.  (‘Teleporting cops’ are a big offender here.)
-Lots of lazy Ubisoft-like copy-paste ‘go to quest marker’ filler ‘gameplay.’
-And bugs.
-So many bugs.
-Did I mention bugs?
-Tons of other small and large issues that would take me way too long to get into.

The only features that remotely resemble what was promised are the parts that were featured in E3 gameplay demos.  Your narrative choices matter ~for those missions and only those missions~ though.  They DO NOT IMPACT THE STORY OR WORLD, in spite of the E3 narrator’s claims.

This game is a pack of lies and you can both sense and physically ~see~ where the devs were forced to cut content of what the intended vision of the game was, in order to rush this broken unfocused mess out the door for 2020.

There’s so many loose ends to the game that make it feel like it’s going one way - but nope, it turns into just another go-to-quest-marker game except with gameplay that is markedly worse than the most recent offerings of those kind of games.  (i.e. At least it’s fun to swing around NYC as Miles Morales when he goes to his generic quest markers, and his combat loop is actually fun.)

I cannot recommend this game.  And that’s not because of the bugs.  It’s because of problems that are core to the game that can’t be patched.  At least not without gutting entire systems of the game and narrative arcs that are already built-in as linear experiences.  Instead I will point people towards playing these games that will offer you bits and pieces of what Cyberpunk promised to be but failed to deliver on.  Both gameplay and narrative wise.

-Fallout New Vegas
-Disco Elysium
-Prey: Mooncrash DLC
-Ruiner
-Observer
-VA-11 Hall-A
-Ghostrunner
-Cloudpunk

As I stated at the start of my review, I will be requesting a refund from steam.  I’m not buying another CP-Red game until they earn back my trust, and given the amount of Todd Howardesque lies that were told about this game, that’s going to be an extremely uphill battle.

Also - There's a couple videos on youtube that I can recommend people check out covering many of the problems I have with the game:

1609783013,"took 4 hours to realize its a narrow railroaded story, asked steam for my money back, got told to go fuck myself.  Haven't touched since. Combat looks basic and samey, story is unresponsive, and not much innovative gameplay either. Hughly disappointed in CDPR."

1609782287,"- Very Good writing
- great world design
- nice gameplay
- bugs bearable"
1609782155,Buggy but fun
1609782104,"Main story is good, everything around that is the opposite of the gaming revolution that the devs were talking about. Yes the hype hurt the game, but the devs falsely and heavily empowered that hype.
The world looks nice (if you have an RTX graphics card, otherwise it still looks good, but runs terrible. I can run Witcher 3 on 4k with very high settings, but can barely run Cyberpunk in 1440p with low-medium settings) but it does not feel alive. The NPCs have a horrible AI, the drivers don't have an AI at all, just like the police. 
The open world doesn't feel like it was in development for 8 years, but like it was released 8 years ago. It is on the same level as the standard Ubisoft open world, 'wide as an ocean deep as a puddle', with repetitive tasks. ""Find the 8 missing cars"", ""Find the 20 graffitis"", ""Go there kill that guy"", with less than a paragraph of story.

It feels like an Alpha Version of the game with everything except the main story not even close to a finished product. I would not recommend to buy this YET. I hope they properly update the game."
1609782086,So much fun.  Not a lot of bugs for me.  Nothing too crazy for a game this big.
1609782081,Not as advertised
1609782016,Very great all around game with the exception of a few bugs and glitches nothing game breaking though
1609781958,The game is pretty good. Good story line and character interactions. I play on PC and have had little to no issues with the game. It will DEFINITELY hold you attention.
1609781857,"So refreshing to have a game that is trying to be a good game instead of just be a game and sell lots. I had almost forgot what it felt to play a 'NEW' game instead of an old game with a slight graphical update or a higher number tacked on the end of it like 'generic franchise entry number 72'

Does that mean it has a few teething issues and bugs, yes. yes it does. There's also been patches to fix them and more will be needed but that's just what happens with software and is to be totally expected in a game with complex systems interacting with one another. churned out re-skinned games like COD, AssCreed or tomb raider which are basically the same games as they were a decade ago (or more) have no excuses for 'bugs' but a game as VAST and complex as this one its frankly amazing that it works as consistently well as it does.

As for Gameplay Imagine a deus ex game but bigger and a bit of the Witcher 3 thrown in. If that isn't enough for you to instantly want this game I suspect your waiting for the latest re-skin of generic franchise 6 and are fond of beige. This game is not beige its about as from it as you can get. neon yes beige no.

its certainly not for everyone, its very adult and deals with complex often tricky subject matter. I am not someone who can judge if this game deals with Trans (sexual) or trans-humanist issues perfectly but it does so better than any game I am aware of simple by virtue of trying to deal with/include difficult subjects. most games force you to play a gruff voiced 35 year old male with social problems or a gruff voiced 35 year old male that is re-skined to appear female. cyberpunk is different while still allowing that literal option (penis optional). actually the voice acting is better than that but close enough.

The story is top draw (for a game) but not for everyone, however the game is comfortable in its own skin (a theme) and doesn't care if you agree or like the story its the story its telling like it or leave it. you could (mostly) avoid the story if you wished and just explore the huge vivid and deep game world if you wanted it would still have more to offer than the vast majority of games released. 

Cyberpunk holds a grimy neon mirror to the world and reflects so many realities while providing a heap of things to do. not just the best game I've played this year but one of the best I've ever played and I've been playing PC games since the 1980's.

I hope you enjoy"
1609781694,"I like the story for this game, and I like the idea, but I simply cannot recommend this game in this state. It is buggy and unfinished."
1609781679,I was excited for the game but i enjoy it. I like that many quest have different ways to solve them even if they show you option a/b/c there could be a d you never saw. i hope dlc and updates only give me more value.
1609781670,You play as vagina in her quest to save the kingdom from arasoma an evil Chinese organization and you have a wide array of weapons and super powers to do so but it doesn’t matter because she and her buddy Johnny die 3 hours into the game leaving it up to a transvestite ghost who hates capitalism
1609781639,yes
1609781573,"Fun game. Mainly the story is very interesting and fun. Don't expect an open world like GTA because you will be disappointed. If you want to enjoy this game, emerse yourself in side- and mainstory and you will be fine. 

Yeahyeah, a little buggy and the ps4 version sucks. Whatever I play on PC, bother someone else! Don't ruin my fun."
1609781552,"The gun play is fantastic for me, really love the way that any build is a 'doable' build.   The story is great, really love the interactions you have.  Once you get double jump, the game REALLY opens up, and the parkour is really fun.   The way you can transition from stealth to full combat, throw in the cyber stuff, and melee builds being viable, it's great.

There are tons of bugs you can run into but it's almost like another aspect of the game now.  It has crashed twice on me, way way less than games like Fallout New Vegas.  at 120 hours, still have not completed the storyline missions, but still loving the side missions.

But.  My taste is suspect, I liked NMS on launch too."
1609781507,"Game's decent at best but still not bad enough to not recommend it. They didn't add all the things they said they would which is very bad. Waiting 1 year to play this is probably a good idea.
"
1609781378,"I personally didn't experience a lot of bugs, performance was great no stuttering on a Helios 300. But i'd wait till they fix everything to give it a try. Otherwise a really good game with great characters and an outstanding soundtrack."
1609781291,"Amazing story, will need a hefty PC to run properly, lots of bugs that need to be ironed out!"
1609781285,"this game is simply stunning. zero problems encountered. just wish there were more customizations for cyberware i.e mantis blades, and car's etc"
1609781140,"The game was advertised as an open world RPG. Lie. This is an overly regulated and very limited open world FPS with strong GTA flavor, nothing more. In case you expected something like KOTOR, DA, ME, VTM or Witcher then scream out and run. Far away. It's beautiful though. Like Disney's SW. Pretty but painfully empty."
1609781118,"Maybe this game stinks on last gen consoles but my PC setup, which is hardly a powerhouse, runs it beautifully. I have encountered some small bugs but nothing game breaking. 
The gameplay is fun and flexible and the main story has a lot of great moments and decisions but this game shines in the side quests. I've never been more impressed with the depth some of these small tasks add to world.
"
1609781109,Very good game
1609781080,"This is a great game.  Just as good as The Witcher 3.  I don't know what everyone is crying about with this game.  It was made by the same company that made The Witcher 3 which everyone loved and has ALL of the exact same issues.  What did you all expect?  I had to mod the crap out of TW3 just to stop trees from flopping all over in the wind, to get Geralt to walk instead of running around like he is on ketamine, the controls for the horse were unmanageable, the sail on the boats entirely blocks your view, etc etc etc.  Just look at the mod list for TW3, most the top mods are quality of life fixes.  This is why you play on PC folks, for the mods, to fix the baffling screw-ups from the developers.  

All in all its just as good as TW3 it just needs the modders to finish the game...as always.  Chill out."
1609781041,"I love this game. Combat is surprisingly fluent, characters are fantastically written, game is carried by a very strong plot, world building is mesmerizing.

But there are simply way too many bugs. I liked the game enough to overlook a lot of its flaws, but that doesn't mean you should too.

Additionally, the game is very lacking in certain area, particularly in customization. Clothing choices are stats bound and there's zero fashion cyberware options. And you can't even change the color of your car. Lack of customization contradict the Cyberpunk theme tremendously. There are also numerous QoL issues such as the inability to craft multiple items at once etc. 

I would wait a few months or so when the game is less bug ridden before buying it. And some potential will not be realized until they have the time to introduce completely new systems to the game. This game needs more time."
1609780776,"Although the game has had some controversial reviews, I think it's rather good. Pick this up if you are looking for a mix of Deus Ex and GTA."
1609780776,"So far, few bugs and gorgeous gameplay"
1609780644,"Extraordinary world building, frenetic action, fulfilled all my expectations as someone who has loved this world since I first played Cyberpunk 2020 in 1995. I have not encountered any significant problems on the PC so I assume the rough early launch issues have been addressed as of Hotfix 1.06."
1609780571,good game lots of fun minor bugs but none of the ones I have experienced have been game breaking and have just been minor ones during cut scenes. im playing on a Ryzen 5 2600 and a 2060rtx
1609780559,"peac of shit
"
1609780541,RIP Jackie
1609780503,Even though at the time of this review the game is unfinished I'm having a blast. My personal GOTY 2020.
1609780435,9.5/10
1609780240,liked the theme and the hacking features of the game. The whole experience and freedom in the game.009o
1609780180,
1609779962,Great game with some minor glitches that can be looked past.
1609779839,cool game
1609779769,"This was the perfect game to end 2020 with for me. It was glitchy and terrible, just like everyone said, and when I got tired of that I uploaded the new driver and it became metaphorically shiny and chrome since then and so I've been enjoying it that now. Game is huge. Voice acting seems very middle-range, with some extraordinary highlights. Their constructed world has a lot of interesting elements and so much less pervasive PD presence to spoil one's fun. Worth it generally if one's machines can really do the math and worth a wait if not. It's not so amazing you'll die if you wait and but good enough that it's worth a try if you can. 

This is one cold city taken over by jaded advertising and thugs. I was expecting science-fiction but it's fine."
1609779760,"Buggy but fantastic fun, highly recommend."
1609779755,"While its got a few rough edges with the AI, actually a really enjoyable game with an interesting story line. Needs to be on something other than 'Normal' difficulty if you are looking for a decent shooter challenge though."
1609779755,"Dex is a full ass bitch. But I like the game it runs pretty okay, haven't run into game breaking glitches but a few minor ones other than that tho I'm really loving the game."
1609779462,"TRASH. Way below expectations. Decided to play again thinking that I ll just play the main story line and get done with this game, but nope another horrible bug where I just die at a checkpoint in the middle of the mission. So called new patch doesn't fix much if it cant even fix the main story line, second time decided to call quits. What a waste."
1609779316,"The game is alright - if your rig can run it (ironically, I have bought a brand new PC with rtx 3070 to be able to play this game since I anticipated it for years), the graphics are stunning. Combat is fun enough, weapon variety is sufficient, and the story is brilliant. But I would definitely NOT recommend the game, at least not yet. The amount of bugs and glitches is horrid, the world and NPCs are unfinished, the choices do not matter, the game is no longer an RPG but Action Adventure (btw CDPR how the hell do you dare to change the game genre AFTER people buy it? I paid for an RPG if I recall correctly!)... I could go on forever but TLDR, the developers underdelivered, features were craped, promises not met, and players and investors betrayed. The game, for what it offers, as I already mentioned, is alright. The game, for what it was SUPPOSED to offer, is far from finished."
1609779314,"The bugs are okay. Optimization is not good. If you have a 10 series GPU, it won't run at 60 fps high. If you have a higher architecture, go for it. The story itself is worth playing the game."
1609779253,Its pretty good it takes you to a whole new world. Cool World. It needs TLC the potential is amazing
1609779568,"the good:

game's artistical part is 10/10. the city, clothing, cars, ambience and music are amazing.

story's good, I'm not a rpg guy and it hooked me to the end. side quests are a mixed bowl: some of them are generic trash and  some of them (most of them, i'd say) are just epic, like peralez' quest chain, delamain or one where you have to help kerry (old johnny's band colleague) sabogate a k-pop band that is doing covers of his songs. 

the bad: 

the game is absolutely bug-ridden. there is a shitton of bugs in every imaginable way and facet, too many of them to list them here. Most of em weren't gamebreaking at all. For example, when exceeding X speed with a car or bike your character will briefly appear over the vehicle in a T pose. npcs eating invisible food, taking selfies with invisible phones, alerted pedestrians disappearing when moving the camera off them and generally acting super dumb ... that kinda stuff. 

those didnt bother me too much so I could go through the game without too much hassle, but I can see some people getting rightly frustrated by some of the bugs.  they can be very immersion breaking at times.

another thing this game is severely lacking is world interaction. as I said the city is amazing, best open world scenario ive seen in any game, period. problem is that this amazing, colorful world is an empty shell where you can't do anything but questing. Billiards, arcade machines, npc hookers, ambulance/firefighter missions, casino, pachinkos... you can't even sit on a stool. the amount of wasted possibilities is massive. Some games like gta 3 did that 20 years ago. let that sink in.


the ugly:

both the bug and interactivity issues don't bother me too much because i know the former will be eventually fixed, and the latter will be adressed by cdpr via dlc/free patches.

the AI of the game however may be a more difficult issue to tackle. it's bad, like very very bad. wanted sysem is the worst of all: when you commit a crime, instead of police cars and other vehicles chasing you, police npcs will start poppint 3 meters away from you. no matter where you go, they will keep popping right in front of you. if you get out with a car they won't pursue you simply because the game inst programmed to do that. 

all the cars are programmed to follow a straight on-rails line and won't leave it no matter what. If you block a road with your car other cars won't try to avoid it, they will just sit there honking like retards. likewise, if you shoot people inside their cars, they will just leave them and crouch with the standard ""afraid"" animation and stay there forever or until killed.

there are few races in the game where the cars are absolutely unable to follow you or actually drive and win the race, so the game just respawns them behind you every second. this is probably the most flagrant example of terrible npc driving ai.

about performance: you will need a beefy machine. I'm getting 30-50 fps with a 3080, 3700x and 16 gb ram with everything on ultra + rtx on at 2440p. 

my conclusion is that the game is good, even with its flaws, and definitely worth the price if youre not too bothered by the bugs and shit performance (which will be fixed eventually, I hope)."
1609782413,"Totally not a RPG. Decent loot-heavy hack'n'slash FPS with fixed story and just a few branches. And ironically in need of more polish.

Some crowd agents are immortal and can't even be targeted for example, hope this would get fixed soon.

Not to say about lots of tiny scripting issues, item duping, infinite money and practical player immortality.

But while having a lot of game balance and mechanics broken, some of those bugs make for quite amusing unintentional mechanics.

Kerenzikov-hop is one of those few things that make whole ordeal enjoyable, offering quite fun way to move around at high speeds with some little practice. Should be preserved as a full-blown mechanic, or at least not removed, even if behind some gameplay setting.

Also lore has somewhat transmetropolitan feel."
1609779032,"I love this games world and the excitement I felt exploring it. It's got great quests and graphics are top notch for high end PC's. That being sad on my second playthrough i've seen way more bugs and had to reload many more times to fix a glitch or something buggy. The weather has gotten stuck, random ringing sound that wouldn't go away til reload along with many little things. This is by far the best and worst game i've played ever. You can be enjoying so many things while also being dissapointed with so many along the way. It really couldve used another year in development, but I'm so glad I got to play it. It's a game were you have to live through the faults and accept them in order to enjoy the game for what it shouldve been. Hopefully they can really fix key issues and bugs."
1609888773,A scandalous and impulsive purchase.
1609778984,"This game is not perfect yes it has plenty of bugs and glitches but so does skyrim.  overall the game is super fun I have really and truly enjoyed the game and the world it is set in.  The characters are very likeable and have unique personalities one of my favorite characters died at a portion of the story and i nearly cried.  another thing that makes the game really fun is just the general setting, Night City is amazing everything about this game immerses you into the world and the characters it creates.  This game has litterally torn me away from every other regular game i play for a solid week because its just that good thank cdpr for making something that is the funnest thing ive played in years."
1609778909,Great game overall. Only problem for me is the bugs and glitches tho.
1609778879,"No flashlight for the dark and dingy areas of the game, robbing any sense of intrigue or mystery. it feels like they want you to look around, but only for the next loot box. the scanning mode is supposed to replace this by lightly illuminating the corners with the mesh lines. lazy as fuck. 

there is no 3rd person in a game devoted to a futuristic ego-centric aesthetic. why? not even the mods are good yet. there's no animations for it so it wasn't even a thought.

cars feel 3/5. better than wildlands if they don't glitch out on your system.

gun upgrading feels like borderlands a bit. fun to toy around with but a slog to grind out. feels like the only band aid they had for keeping the combat from looking stale. I'm playing on the hardest difficulty and it took me 3-4 hours to make it a cake walk.

this is not a deep game despite it presenting itself that way. its a grindy FPS with a 3/5 maybe 4/5 story. (not gonna bother finishing right now. ) the story I got into feels like they're holding punches. 

worth a try but it's definitely a discount grab. play with a buddy and share the purchase or something because you could beat it in no time.

tldr 3/5 there's shit holdin it back."
1609778842,"Despite all of the negativity surrounding this game, I will still say this is one of my most favorite game of all time. I have already played 70 hours of this, not completed the main storyline yet. 

The graphics are so good, if you have the right hardware (I am playing on a 2070 super). The details are so amazing.

The game crashes occasionally, which needs to be fixed. The devs are doing a really great job on the patches. Already they have provided 3 patches in a month, which fixes a lot of issues. This game has a lot more potential. The devs should brings back the cut contents and expand the story with large DLCs. I think, this will be a masterpiece 1 year from now.

Really feel sorry for the devs, for not getting the love they deserve for this game. The naivety of the management, greed of the investors, and complaints from cry-babies who sends death threats for delaying the release of the game, are some of the reasons which give this game a bad name now.

Just Try it, ignore all the drama, think you will love it. If you don't then you can always go for a refund."
1609778750,"I have waited for so long for a cyberpunk themed GTA V. The game falls short of all my expectations. Unfortunately the gameplay doesn't offer anything that is unique. The main storyline is %90 conversation and %10 action which was such a drag to get through. Biggest flop ever, 7 years and you came up with this? We have been screwed."
1609778715,"Game is absolute garbage.
Nothing is like it was shown in trailers, everything was cut from game. 
Bugs, bugs, bugs and then some.
Its RPG except it dosnt have single RPG mechanic. Skills that you buy dont work for the most part some actually are not even in game like using enemy as shield and shooting at same time.

Your choices dont matter, no matter what you do outcome is ALWAYS the same.

Games basic functions like AI are simply non existent. 

All that is not even worst part, its the story and characters, you can tell until they hired Kiano it was meant to be different game, now everything was made around him but it was rushed and halfassed leaving plot holes, unfinished quests etc. Its scify game in future yet there is nothing futuristic to do nothing special. Some of the best ideas from original like blackwall etc are just mentioned and not even properly explained.  

And so on and on. I cant even there is so much that is broken its not even funny.

Possibly worst game in recent years and it feels like early psx game with much wors AI then any psx game. Driver from psx had better car AI... Honestly don't buy it its garbage.

If you want similar gameplay but actually fun just play Borderlands (same gameplay but fun) or even better DeusEx for climate and actual good rpg experience."
1609778683,"I feel like this game will never be the game that I was initally promised and what I hoped it would be. Not even counting in the bugs and glitches and poor performance on other systems, but the core mechanics seem so overrushed and half a**ed, with content cuts everywhere, shallow and irrelevant backstories, insanely stupid AI, and a narrative driven by others than me.

Not gonna lie I had my fun with this game, but it hurts to see what they promised in contrast to what CDPR delivered. I'm sorry for the fans and the devs that actually tried to create something amazing. 
"
1609778651,Oh my gawd I'm absolutely loving this friggin game so much I have found some small weird bugs and glitches but keep finding more to love every time I play.
1609884991,"It's been a while since I've played a game in which the characters feel like real people.  Where you actually care what happens to them.  And unfortunately with this game, it all ends in tears.

Amazing plot to play through, but ultimately you'll feel like shit when you complete this game.
Thanks CD Projekt, but also fuck you."
1609778482,"I would not recommend this to anyone. It`s in the early stages, I get multiple crashes over the course of one week since I got it, patches and fixes still coming out so I suggest you wait, Now , Steam won`t allow me a refund since I already played more than 2 hours, It takes about 6 hours to get the game going with all it`s graphical settings and so on, not mention the multiple crashes and bugs encountered in the game, but I guess that`s why they have this 2 hours policy, so you buy the product and you cannot refund it, ever again. Basically you are stuck with a 50£ game, that is not what was advertised , it`s not working, crashes multiple times, has a trillion bugs and the overall experience is just bad. A sorry excuse of a game, I was expecting more from CDPR, since this is the company that gave us The Witcher 3. But Cyberpunk 2077 is just an overhyped mess. Stay away!!"
1609778448,makes ya feel like a cyber punk
1609778294,"Alright, so this game brings mixed emotions, having waited for this game for years and being part of the hype train. No, it didn't live up to what we thought the game was going to be. Yes, the game is a bug ridden mess. Yes the game has less features that titles that are 10+ years old. Still, the question is if I'd recommend the game, to which I'd say you should. In the 100ish hours I've played Cyberpunk I completed every side gig, every job, pretty much everything. Was the game fun? Yes. Best open world RPG? Hell no. Is the game worth $60? Yes, considering there aren't any other AAA open world RPG games released as of recently.

All in all, I'll give you a 1-10 sliding scale.

Combat: 4/10; Although combat at first seems fun and challenging, it becomes tedious and repetitive quickly with how dumb the AI is.

Story arch: 9/10; The main story line is great, albeit a bit short. the only reason it doesn't earn a 10/10 is due to an ending spoiler I won't reveal but it left much to be desired.

Map: 8/10: Night city is pretty immersive and large, although I hoped that there would be more fleshed out buildings, props, honestly anything to add more passive RP into the RPG game, but whatever.
Cars and driving: 4/10; Not much to say about this one, if you don't live under a rock, or have been avoiding looking at game play, cars suck. No customization, clunky driving mechanics, and tying into bugs, if you drive a car for let's say, five continuous minutes, you will experience pop in car bugs where suddenly a car just appears in front of you, causing you to crash your car. AI will just sit behind the wheel and stare at you, even if you shoot at their car.

AI: 2/10; Yikes, one line of dialogue before the NPC responds with ""...!"" no thanks, like that's sort of unforgivable. The worst part about the weak dialogue lines is when you first start the game, there's so interesting dialogue exchanges between random pedestrians, and idle NPCs, but pretty much as soon as you finish the intro mission, that's out the window and the NPCs become shallow, uninteresting one-liners.

Overall experience: 6/10; wish I could say it was better, it wasn't, there were a few times where I found parts of the overall gameplay exceptional, but the majority of the game was mundane.

Sorry to cd projekt red, not sorry to the share holders and the community members who demanded release dates, but what cd projekt red did in the release of Cyberpunk 2077 hopefully will change the landscape of gaming in a positive way, but we all know that's wishful thinking."
1609778132,the bugs will be gone some day =)
1609778089,"The Setting and the Story are the selling points here, and in that arena the game knocks it out of the park, I ended up sinking in the extra hours looking for the interesting side quests.

All together the shooting, driving, and melee mechanics have been done better separately in other games, and I wasn't too fond of them in the beginning. It was only after a couple levels with the weapons I'd been using (in my case Rifles) and getting a precision rifle that I started to get the feel they were going for, especially on the harder difficulties you're going to want to heavily invest in a specific playstlye to get the most out of the non story elements here.

Night City is down right Gorgeous with the right Hardware and I didn't encounter any bugs that weren't minor graphical glitches in the 50 hours I played so far."
1609778058,"The game is great, but the bugs at the moment can ruin your experience if you pay too much attention to them. If you haven't bought it yet, wait a little bit."
1609777907,My biggest let down of 2020
1609777832,good game
1609777639,Gud
1609777458,ebic game
1609777400,"Obvious pain points but, I really like what CDPR was trying to make. Will probably be better with support."
1609777386,"Story made me cum
"
1609777384,"Cyberpunk does not change the way we do play games. It didint make changes in my personality nor prevents the worlds hunger. It's a game afterall. With that in mind i'd like like to share my experience with game.

+ The game looks just amazing. The lights, textures, buildings and characters look great. I was just experiencing the game as it was intended - not analyzing traffic or passerby scripts - and i loved the views. Plenty of times i've been just taking photos to admire the beauty of the game.
+ Never before i've experienced such intense and gripping dialogues in game - characters move, interact with items around, gesture and use face expressions - it's just marvelous to watch them.
+ Main story is nice - i really like this much more 'earthbound' story. Especially the ending - it was a bit unpredictable and moving.
+ Exploration of the Night City and it's surroundings is a treat for RPG lovers - i've not used a quick travel options once. I just enjoy riding a car through the streets while looking around.
+ Fair RPG elements - even tho many would say the game lack's RPG elements - i disagree. You can create your own character and your playstyle - and it does a difference. I was able to sneak past the guards countless numbers of time thanks to my skills - oppening some doors, hacking systems etc. It was very rewardind to find out there's always a route for my style of play during the mission.
+ Dubbing (english) is really really good. Actors are charismatic, full of energy and they fit their roles very well.
+ Non-linear gameplay - Even tho the game might not be hinting that - plenty of times you can change the outcome of mission by simply exploring or taking some side action. The game contains dozens of hidden scripts you may not even find and it's prepared for it - characters will pay attention to your actions. Sometimes such actions may even affect the main story later on giving you more options.

- As a common knowledge says - at this point of time the game is quite buggy. I've seen flying cars (not intentionaly), objects floating around or not spawning at all (for example a part of street wasnt there when i was driving so i flew underneeth the whole level) and scripts not firing when expected. Thankfully nothing that a quick load wouldn't help with.
- Altough there's many good, funny or interresting side quests to experience (and i've made evey single one in the game) - there's also some boring and irritating ones - when you have to walk around looking for some stupid clues with a scanner. I've literally spent like 20 minutes walking around like a freak just to find out i've already picked up the clue - i just had to fish it inside the Inventory and examine but the game didn't tell me that).
- UI could be better - It's still pretty fine, tho browsing inventory is a nightmare. There's so many types of items - especially trash ones you just sell for money - finidng the one you're looking for feels like a mission impossible."
1609777355,"Haven't encountered a bug yet!
Script is awesome, detail is amazing, story is great!"
1609777208,"Despite the bugs, despite how much was cut from the game. I think that the story is phenomenal. 

After 36 hours of this game, finishing the main mission, I still want to go back and do all the side missions because they're that well written. I'm hopeful that the devs will be allowed to expand on this game further as there is LOADS of potential on a game that I would already be okay with paying full price for."
1609777164,"Now that I've put in over 100 hours into the game I can safely say it's well worth the money if you enjoy an RPG with a compelling story, great action, beautiful graphics and immersive gameplay. Don't get on the negative train and believe all the bad press it's been getting, if you are playing on PC, the bugs are at a minimum now, with only a few glitches here and there. To put things in perspective, the Fallout series had way more bugs one month after launch. I full well believe this will end up being a classic that players will go back to again and again, I'm already planning my second run through and I haven't even finished the game yet!"
1609777104,"Awesome RPG game. Lots of looting and gameplay mechanics that will take a while to master but will make you feel powerful. Great main story and at times even better side jobs. Dozens and dozens of so-called gigs. Take your time. Play on hard. Specialize. 
Through my playthrough so far ( on act ii currently after 43 hours of gameplay ) I've seen some weird graphical glitches and physics, especially with vehicles, and had one crash. The game could definitely use some improvements and polishing. Maybe some overhauls on the general population npc AI would be good as well, because if you look for it while getting around Night City you will definitely see the flaws.
Performance with I can run with most things on high w/o raytracing at ~35-40 FPS with my i5 16 GB RAM Nvidia 1060 GTX 6GB, SSD setup. Make sure to install on SSD.
All in all a great game that I absolutely love immersing myself in. Will be playing this for a while. Once the patch jobs are done, we can also expect some Blood & Wine sized free DLC's coming out soonish, so I think this game will get many hours playtime for me.
"
1609777071,Pretty good
1609776925,Game keeps flatlining after the character design page. Tried verifying the game files and updating windows... Did not fix it. If anyone knows anything else I can try please tell me. Paid $60 to not even see the game.
1609776908,Wait for some stable and useful patch. No need to rush.
1609776796,"This feedback is MO. 

- The bugs are not so relevant to me because this can happen and for CD it is a new IP. And they are trying hopefully to fix it. You even get always bugs for games like COD, Ubisoft games etc. and most of there games are copy & paste work.

- The story was kind of boring. The first hours were fine but then nah not catchy. Not really deep enough for me. I love this setting but im kind of disappointent about the story. 
- Didnt like how they added silverhand to the game. It was for me pretty annoying because i didnt had any connection to him. Would be better if he was like a boss fight or a dude who gave you quests or doing quests with him.
Then the side missions were not that creative and deep enough. There were some good missions but why so short. 
The driving is horrible! Even the mini map sucks hard! 
the NPC and the city feels kind of stupid they dont integrate like in GTA 5 or any other open world games. Just very sad. 
I also dont know if it was a good idea to have it only first person view. To have it third person would be better but to have the option to switch would be much better. 
If i would rate the game i would give it a 6/10. And would not pay then $30. But i will give it another try at some later time and will update my review it is getting better or not."
1609776745,Nice game
1609776723,"**** this games story was amazing and so were the characters. The world was awe-inspiring and always found myself to stop every once and a while to look at the view. Now to the reason why I am taking 2 points off after saying how amazing the game is. Lots of cut content and bugs (in my experience, I did not have many bugs, only a few minor bugs and 1 bug that made me restart the application). First, lets talk about the cut content. There is lots of cut content ranging from minor things like wall-running to major things like police A.I and ""powerful mercs that come after you for causing to much chaos"" and dialogue choices that matter. Not to say there aren't choices that matter, just very few (mostly at the end of the game). Now to the bugs and stuff like that, there are a lot of bugs in the game, although it varies from person to person. In my experience I didn't encounter a lot of bugs like I stated earlier in the review. From what I have heard it appears most bugs and issues happen to people with higher end pc's (?). But all in all, this is an excellent game people should experience once its patched.

Finished every single quest and side activity, loved it all the way through - blemishes and all.

1609775279,"Well, apart from everyone complaining about the game, i liked it!"
1609775278,good game has a few bugs fixing with update
1609775255,i don't know why people say this is a bugy mess of a game and that you should not buy it i have encounter little to no bugs in my 8hs of play time. don't let people make decisions for you give it a try
1609775115,"Having played this for 143 hours and completing the main story-line along with a hoard of side quests, I can definitely say that this has the substance to become an amazing game.
The gameplay is quite interesting as there are so many builds that one can choose from, whether it is a melee build, or a hacker build or a shooter build. Under each of these, there are further options and as one progresses into the game, more and more unique options are unlocked which enables the player to get more involved with the build. Character customizing is available at the start after which it's more of a dress-up kinda game with some minor attributes which can be fitted in as mods into the clothing. I only wish they had an option to change your look completely as the game progressed.
The characters in the game are very well thought of and well created. Each has their own story and come with their own personal baggage. Apart from the main story and some of the side quests resulting from the main story line, there are so many chance encounters and random characters that one gets to meet, driving around night city and taking on contracts and gigs.  One thing that I really loved was chancing upon a random crime scene and finding a shard which had a conversation. Reading that would give the picture of what went down there. That is a rather nice touch.
The music is wonderful and the radio stations have a good variety of songs and most of them are very apt for the game. The best part of the soundtrack is the battle music. Really helps in getting immersed with the gameplay at that time. The sound options are rather lacklustre and in some PCs, the radio isn't heard while driving the vehicles. I have had that issue personally and was tweaking a  lot of audio settings before I was able to make it more audible, but not at the cost of skewing up other sounds.
There are a plethora of vehicles to choose from but for a cyberpunk game they rather sound like regular engines. The driving mechanics seems rather crude. The cars handle very strangely and the bikes are like bouncy vehicles. Driving off a cliff doesn't impact the vehicle or the player in any way and the player is firmly rooted on the seat. I really wished that they had added some form of modifications to the rides too. That would have been rather cool, like attach nitro boost to the bikes, customize the colors of the vehicles, add a turret on the back of a truck, etc etc etc.
There are water bodies and one can swim in them, if one falls off a bridge or is knocked off by a random car. But, there is really no use of the swimming ability apart from that. Also, there is a perk which makes us less detectable underwater which leads me to believe that it was a part of the game which was left unfinished or maybe might be a part of some future DLC.
The fight sequences are fun as one can approach them in many different ways including combining different playstyles in the same encounter. For example, use hacking to distract the enemy and then use the awesome mantis blades for a deadly melee attack, or just sniping them off from a distance, or neutralizing them with hacks, etc etc etc.
Graphics and the world build quality is very extensive and detailed. But, having said that doesn't mean it's perfect. It is riddled with numerous bugs and glitches, some of which are absolutely hilarious and some very immersion breaking. I personally enjoyed the glitches and had a good laugh at each of them. CDPR is doing a good job if handling the issues and setting them right. I only wish that they had focused on one platform first and perfected it.
I play on a rather outdated PC and despite it being slightly better that the minimum requirement for the game, I had not one single crash. The look and feel was amazing and I am looking forward to playing this game on an RTX enabled system in the near future. For any open world game, the side quests is what really help make the game more interesting and immersive. This game definitely delivered on that. The NPCs and AI could have been designed more intuitively and I do hope that it does work out as a patch later this year where CDPR is able to fix that.
I will continue to play this game and finish it to a 100% and then start to explore other builds as it is very interesting to dwell into them. I personally feel this game is far from complete and wish that CDPR is able to do full justice to it ASAP.
Here's wishing for the best. Good luck!
Happy New Year!"
1609774756,"It's a fun game, but definitely does not live up to the hype. The story is really great, but that's one of the few shining moments of this game."
1609785478,"AI, Weapons, Armour, Builds, Driving and Looting are all crap, there are so many bugs and most of the content is rinse and repeat. Good story and characters tho."
1609774498,"This will be my second, yes...that's right, SECOND time buying Cyberpunk 2077. A little backstory, I originally was to play this game on the new Series S/X console. But unfortunately was not (still don't) able to get one. So I ended starting this game on my One S...and wow, what a surprise that guess what? Yup, that's right...it was almost unplayable. I tried to power through the game, but..my sibling found out how I was playing and told me to stop playing until I got something new...hardware wise. Being a Series S/X or SOMETHING. 

Well, comes Christmas and the wifey could NOT get her hands on a new console. So she bought me parts for a new PC!! 

I was so excited to put it all together JUST SO I CAN EXPERIENCE THIS GAME LIKE IT SHOULD BE!! Booted the new system up, installed system drivers, and downloaded steam..despite all the hate and current legal issues....I did the unthinkable, I bought CP2077 FULL PRICE...AGAIN! Started it up, and WOW...I was BLOWN AWAY at the difference in experience I was having. It was surreal, I'm now so immersed into Night City..every time I get ready to hop in, it's like I feel I'm in Night City. I'm actually able to enjoy the game to 100% capacity. I know I wouldn't be able to play at 100% ultra settings. But I can play on high settings with a couple things turned down and enjoy a CRISPY, BEAUTIFUL LOOKING 60~FPS in 1080p. If you're on the fence on buying this game due to rumors, or thinking you don't have the hardware for it....if you have atleast the recommend requirements or a little higher, do yourself a favor..BUY IT! Below are listed my system components that can run this game like I stated. 

Well, if you made it this far...I hope you understand, buy and enjoy the game! Happy New Year! 

My system components:
CPU- Ryzen 5 3600 with Stock Cooler at stock settings
Motherboard- ASUS B550 TUF PLUS Wifi
GPU- Gigabyte 5600XT OC (Triple fan model)

Case- Phanteks P300A + 2 be quiet! Silent Wings 2 intake fans"
1609774263,Not much so say.. if your rig can run the game on pc.. then its an awsome game!
1609774201,One of the best games I've ever played.
1609774092,"Apart from delivering a unpolished game, it is not half as bad as the loudmouth critics make it seem."
1609774088,"Love it! In spite of all the axed content, stupid AI, stupid driving system and the rest.. it's a fun game and not just the main quest is well done by all the actors, even the side quests are really good!"
1609774061,Great story driven action rpg with many nice and detailed side quests and great charachters to meet. 120 Hrs in and I am not rushing the main mission. Melee only with Katana and Mantis blades are so much fun for first playthrough. I am yet to decide what I will choose for 2nd playthrough. Looking for the new DLC's and big patches to fix some missing content hopefully as they did in Witcher 3.
1609774027,"I hate panam as a character but everyone else is really cool. Keanu Reeves did an amazing job in the marketing and voice acting as well. The game has been amazing so far content wise.

1609773503,"It's great game for 2012.... Not at all what it was marketed to be.  NPCs are mindless zombies, no police AI, no plot choices of consequence, never see your character after character creation, and very buggy.

1609773277,"As a PC player, I've been lucky to not have to deal with the bugs and glitches others have dealt with, so that hasn't really impacted my opinion of the game. There were two 'game-breaking' moments that only required a quick loading of my last save. But, at the end of the day... it just feels soulless and shallow. 

Most choices and backstory elements make no difference other than giving you a different prologue and some additional dialogue options, the main character is annoying and speaks the exact same way no matter your backstory (to burst anyone's bubble, it really doesn't matter what you choose, you'll always end up basically being the Streetkid class), the only character I can actually bring myself to care about in any capacity is Panem. The city is lifeless, there are basic quality of life features missing from the game, the story isn't that fun. I've played two characters and with both I stopped at the exact same mission because I realized I just wasn't having fun. Also, just... the irony of a story centered around capitalism and corporations and mistreatment of employees all headed by a team that forced 6-day work weeks and crunch time. I mean, this writes itself.

Maybe in a year this game will have an epic No Man's Sky-style comback. Maybe you'll be able to change your character's appearance outside of the creation menus, maybe backstory will have more impact than just a 15-minute playable cutscene at the start of the game, maybe changes will be made to the characters that will enrich their stories and get me to care about them.

Honestly, I can't see it happening though. My only regret is giving this game so much time so now I can't get a refund for it."
1609772961,I would avoid the reviews on this game i love it. Just have a decent pc to play it if your going to. It wasnt meant to be on console.

1609772867,"Holy sh*t, the main storyline is already over??? This game is so far from complete in it's current state. Not only story-wise, but the tech as well..."
1609772860,"My bodies do everything together , everything"
1609772783,if you look past the bugs is a great game
1609772688,"Cons:
- There are a lot of problems with the skill tree and user interface (especially crafting).  
- The AI isn't particularly good.
- Main story is quite short.

Pros:
- With good enough hardware the world is very immersive purely on quality of the visuals
- The sound/music are very good
- The gunplay feels great. 
- There are hours of sidequest content if you really want to sink your teeth into the world.  

Overall its probably an 8/10 game.  A little more time in the oven would have made it a masterpiece - here's hoping that we can come back to this in a years time and play it again in an even better way."
1609858030,"I like it :) No, but seriously this is one of the best games i have ever played"
1609772634,"God damn! I've played this game for 223+ hours! First, when I started playing this game I was so hyped about it. Then come all those bugs destroying my ""FUN"". Then CDPR released a few patches to eliminate some but not all the bugs. I enjoyed playing the game again. Doing one side job after another. Leveling up, get new cyber-implant (damn implant are fucking expensive! broke me more then twice hahaha). However I'm still waiting for the big patch that CDPR promised us this year. When that out, I will start a new game and this time I will be more careful in choosing my dialog options etc.

Love the game CDPR! despite the bug, PC crashes more then once but I still love it. So please, please fix this game so I can enjoy it more! bring more life into the city please. Its a city so there should be a lot of people moving around day and night (you said yourself that its a city that never sleeps.

Also please make more shops so we can go to dine, drink (shit.. one drink of beer, liquor and V's already drunk? please fix this) watch BD, option to customize our vehicles (new paint, rims, exhaust like in GTAV). Flying vehicle, boats.

There is a lot of fixes on the game scripting need to be done like for NPC walk into the wall, vehicles hit the side of the road or hit a wall and exploded. Can't hide in bushes. So many to list in here but I guess you know and probably fixing now and will release it in the big patch.

Anyway, I enjoyed playing the game. Fix all the bugs that players complaint and this game will be the GOTY or legend by itself. 

Till then! terima kasih CDPR! 

Also more cloth option so far the best cloth V's get to wear is Johnny Silverhand cloth LUL."
1609772632,good shtuff

1609772328,"Overall great game, yes its a little glitchy at some points and still has some bugs to work out. But graphics and gameplay have far exceeded my expectations. IMO Cyberpunk was absolutely worth the wait."
1609772131,"The game has insightful and interesting stories, strong story telling, great graphics (if you can run it, which I can't lol), and fun combat / player weapons and builds (use katana)"
1609772101,"Big disappointment. 

If the game was just bad, or overall mediocre - well, there wouldnt be any sadness. There definetely would be anger or regret, or irritation maybe. But im sad. 
Originally this game came up on my compass in 2015-ish with the first trailer. That was a good trailer. Interest really started rising with a 2018 gameplay reveal, which, while being quite raw and work-in-progress, promissed very immersive, rich and ""make your own adventure"" kinda of open-world RPG. With a focus on player choice and immersion, mainly. You know, interactive vendor dispalys (from which you actually buy things), first-person gameplay with third-person scenes (to admire your character), custom animations there and there, stuff like that. Branching quests, choices that change the world, character background that shapes their adventure, main story that shaped by your actions. Oh, and all of that on top of the giant cyberpunk city, with ton of npcs, side activities, varying areas, interesting places, factions, and so on, and so forth. 
But the thing is - the atmosphere in place was still the one from the first trailer - grim and gloomy, cyberpunk, basically. 

And that was quickly changed around the start of 2019, with big chungus Keanu and introduction of Johnny Silverhand. 
So mood drastically switched - now we have GTA. Fun, bright adventure with moral choices there and there, but overall - have fun, explore, see what storyline holds for you. Player choices - yeah, sure buddy. Immersion - yeah, no more custom animations and third-person, but hey, if we FP all the time - its even more immersion, right? We were promissed giant, next-gen mobs of civilians, varying weapons, cars, locations, interesting quests... So CDPR was kinda of a cutting back on promises, and adding new ones at the same time. I was disappointed with that, i saw where it leads, but hey, its CDPR, right? They cant just lie and fuck up much? Despite all the delays, despite problematic work code, despite obviosly rushed decisions - i was hyped. 
And the early reviewers were telling about the bugs, true. What they werent speaking of is forgotten promises. Cut content, insane amount of glitches, shitty game engine, unfinished world, bad UI, the list goes on. So i bought the game and started playing. 

And it was alright i guess? For the first 5-10 hours it was good even. But then i start to realise something. THIS is it. There is nothing more. No cool npcs, no factions, no varying enemies, very little ways of going through the gig, railroad-y quests, no real choices, no world influence, no side activities, nothing. The same 5 quickhacks, the same 5 implants, the same 5 weapons, the same 5 enemy variation, the same 5 types of quests... And that without the AI (of ALL the NPCs), without the physics, without the repetative encounters/gameplay, without the game engine... 
(YO WTF is with the game downscaling everything? 80 meters - plop, this is a PS2 graphics, hello. Random building - plop, textures are NOT loading in. Yeah, weve all seen those car sprites, i pity nomad characters. Turn around quickly - this car looks alright. Oh wait, the textures are loading. Ad displays and road signs - yeah, PLOP again. And dont get me STARTED on random spawns. NPCS warp in and out in a plain sight, T pose, cars spawning under each other, cars and npcs switching textures/models... ITS BAD. ITS REALLY BAD. And that is on a medium-high PC above recommended)
...without the empty, shallow world, that clearly DOES NOT want you to interact with anything.

So alright, the game is bad and rushed, and unpolished, and clearly mismanaged, and not ready overall. Why am i saddened? Fuck CDPR, right? Well, no. Game, with all of that shit, still has its charm. The city (not the whole map though) is masterfully crafted. Clothes, cars, weapons look good, amazing even. Character that werent generated look absolutely breathtaking. Some quests (like 20-30%) are good, and some are great. Not even player choice stuff, just overall moral questions, like should we get the baddies get away if thatll cost more lives? Is ignorance truly a bliss? What is religion place in a late-stage capitalsim? And the main quest ones, obviously. What is live, and how do you live it, knowing it is finite and filled with suffering? Knowing that you cant make some choices, you dont have time or energy and death is approaching? Its good. Despite being rushed, despite hammering Johnny in all of that (he werent supposed to be the main plot device prior to 2019) it still delievers. My ending was great. I made a mistake and payed for that, but in the end they gave me choice. ""Any choice is right as long as its willed. Thats the truth"".
The last quest was amazing. Actual meaningful choices, music, moral questions, hell, even 3-rd person scene, where i finally realised that i created a beatiful V... Moments like this, where pieces just click together, where character and their actions make sense, where you really is asking yourself things - yeah. 

Somewhere there exists good, even great game. And sometimes you just see how it supposed to be. Sometimes it just works. And that what makes me sad. I can see the old Cyberpunk in those pieces. I can see the new one, the good new one, too. But that happens once in 3 hours of playtime.
Last quests were good - yeah. Missing personal link, flying through the walls, bugged audio, that somewhat fucked up the last scene. People say that those are not gamebreaking bugs. I disagree. This game supposed to be immersive. Bug or glitch that ruin your immersion IS a gamebreaking bug. Quests that give you no choice in a RPG IS a gamebreaking content. Lack of customisation and side activity DOES ruin the game, that is supposed to be open-world. 

This game is supposed to be great. And sometimes it is great. Most of it though - is not. And thats why im disappointed. And also, fuck CDPR.
"
1609771987,"I usually regret buying AAA titles, but I have to say that I'm actually very impressed with Cyberpunk.  Yes, it has bugs, but they were nothing that was difficult to overlook or work around.  I got pulled into the story through some compelling characters and actually ended up doing most of the available side quests.  I ignored the quests and events that required you initiate them by seeking them out on the map though.  Too many tiny icons on the map for my liking but I may go back later and check out some of them.  I'd say this game is definitely worth it."
1609771939,funee monkee
1609771928,There is way too much hate surrounding the bugs and optimizing issues. The actual content and gameplay of this game is the most refreshing thing I have played in years. If you really are struggling with the optimization issues just download mods for it it will help.
1609771913,"""It's all been a pack of lies"" 



Game is good aside from the bugs and missing/cut content, I leave this review subject to change."
1609771703,"There was a lot of hoohah about bugs and glitches when it came out.  There are some.  Mostly though it's a gorgeous detailed city, fun activities, and a neat character to build (between perks and cyberware, there's a nice spread of fun choices, I might even replay it a second time to concentrate on different attributes and a different playstyle - we'll see.) 

I'm ~60 hours in doing mostly side missions and barely touching the main story, and I just like... exploring and seeing the world still. There's a lot more Johnny comments and interactions than I expected, there's a lot more everything than I expected really.  

It's a good game, solid.  There is a (thin) layer of glitchy/roughness on top, definitely, but there's a deep world to explore under that and the farther into the future you see this, probably the less that thin layer will matter. 

Plenty to enjoy, I'm happy with my purchase, and recommend it to others.  If you have to - wait for the patching first (nothing wrong with that) - but it's worth getting, and a cool ride even day one. 

Have fun!"
1609771690,"this game completely changed my life before it came out i was a scrawny short kid from eastern ukraine reactor 4 but thanks to johnny silverhand i have now gained 30 centimeters in height, my muscles have significantly increased in size and i have attracted several females to my company. i want to personally thank cd project red for creating this masterpiece of a game very cool company, very cool game 10/10 highly recommend"

1609771596,"i'm at 100h of playtime and i barely did act 2, world is huge, quests are fun and engaging, lots of bugs and exploit to play with (spent most of my time pushing limits and figuring stuff that shouldn't need to be figured out but that's fun for me). game really needs to be balanced and polished more but i'm still having a blast and that's what counts."
1609771592,its fun and alot of bugs if you run high graficsetings but the game core is good
1609771377,"20 horas no jogo, começo do ato 2.

Primeiro o mais comentado, bugs e performance.
Bugs- Encontrei 2, um com o audio, fácil resolver, e um pequeno bug no jogo, ao andar de carro o personagem fica em pose T aparecendo fora do carro, coisa de segundos volta ao normal, quebra um pouco a imersão, mas nada que machuque a jogabilidade.
Performance - CPU 2990WX, péssima para games, e uma 2080ti, achei que teria que ajustar algumas coisas da CPU para conseguir jogar bem, mas não, tudo perfeito RTX on, 1440p, deixei o jogo escolher as opções e ficou quase tudo no ultra, não tive nenhum problema, tudo roda suave, nenhum lag ou algo do tipo, nem no hitman2 consigo essa consistência.

Sobre o jogo, não tenho muito com o que comparar, acho que cyberpunk é algo único que irá definir um gênero, percebo que tem algumas coisas faltando no jogo, não consigo nem imaginar como esse jogo será daqui 1 ano, do jeito que está, já é um jogo para entrar para história.

Vale muito a compra, o jogo é barato pelo que oferece."
1609771140,ood
1609771093,"I went into this game pretty blind since I never hopped on the hype train before release, and can objectively say that the game has great potential. That being said, most of that potential is not utilized at this time, and I've been enjoying the memes more than the game itself. Cyberpunk has gorgeous world design, excellent character design (apart from children, who can look like small adults), and a phenomenal soundtrack. Main quests received varying amounts of polish with some of them flowing quite well and others feeling somewhat hamfisted into place. The pacing is all over the place, and you can really feel where content was cut to make deadlines; especially with the nearly inconsequential ""lifepath"" system which boils you down into the ""street kid"" role despite your origins. In what feels like another narrative misstep and perfect example of cut content, almost all early character development is presented to you via montage, which feels like a cop out to transition out of the meaningless ""lifepath"" prologue.

The AI is atrocious, and most NPCs are not scripted to do anything other than cower. There is very little interaction with the world around you, so the whole city feels very shallow and fake despite it's intricately designed ambiance. The police ""wanted"" system simply results in police spawning endlessly on top of you if you do anything ""bad"", which can be as simple as defending yourself from a gang attack, looking at someone too long, or merely existing in the vicinity of a police officer. We've had better systems as far back as GTA III, and there is no excuse for it now. Especially in contrast with the scope of the game and the intent we were sold. From a gameplay perspective, most perks are unbalanced if not completely broken, and can oftentimes punish you for taking them. Many environmental pieces in game are not solid, and it's not uncommon to find yourself falling through terrain into the void. In addition, many items in the game (including what I can only assume are lore pieces such as letters, flyers, etc.) cannot be interacted with or picked up despite having an item icon. It seems like this is most often caused by the items in question being obscured in some degree by other geometry within the world, and the loot system does not offer any workarounds. I had to mention these points because they are not bugs; that is how the game was scripted to behave, and these are design oversights not glitches.

I have hope that CDPR will fix themselves eventually, but I cannot recommend this game at this time, and have uninstalled it on my own PC until they begin to update the game. Apart from the bugs, it just lacks too much to be enjoyable at this point and I'm hoping to return and play it in the future (pending future updates) before I sour my feelings towards it irreparably."
1609771056,"Is good, is buggy.

Playable, but if your want the preem experience, wait for patches."
1609939930,"""Так тихая жизнь или смерть в лучах славы?"" (обзор без спойлеров вообще)
Я игру не ждал вообще, все что я знал это Киану Ривз и мем про breathtaking. За игрой не следил, купил на торренте в день релиза, и потом понял что игра мне понравилась и пошел ее купил в стиме.
МОИ ОЖИДАНИЕ НЕ БЫЛИ ЗАВЫШЕНЫ, ПОЭТОМУ СМОТРЮ ТРЕЗВЫМ ВЗГЛЯДОМ!

У сюжета такой посыл хороший, жизнь на грани смерти, о дружбе и поддержке. Заставляет задуматься и расставить приоритеты в жизни.
Персонажи запоминаются, что сюжетные, что допы. Причем допы проработаны не хуже сюжетных, доп миссий прям дохуя. Чтоб пройти все допы и сюжет на все концовки у меня ушло около 70ч (!)
Если вообще лишь сюжет пройти получится скучно, я второй раз перепрошел чисто сюжетку, и так неинтересно вообще, а так я выполнил все допы, и за один сейв прошел все концовки.
Сюжет мне очень зашел, я персонажей запомнил, они мне в душу запали. помню имя каждого персонажа, их историю, характер, цели, желания. И когда переигрывал сюжетные миссии, и видел персонажей впервые, и их мотивы думаю ""ебать, теперь дошло"", потому что знаю последствия. Запомнил все сначала, и освежил память вторым прохождением.
Играл на английском полностью, озвучку русскую слышал лишь в видео, и фуфуфуфуфуфуфуфуфуфуфуфуфуфу что они сделали с моим Джонни. Не трогайте русскую озвучку, скиппи послушайте и включайте обратно на английскую.
• Сюжету ставлю твердую 10, реиграбельность приветствуется

Геймплей пойдет, не мега ахуенно, но и не дико скучно. Стрельба тут приятная, но я хуярил рукопашкой, потому что вкачал эту ветку. Ветки прокачки скучные, ты листаешь все перки по очереди, и ни один не интересен. Там такие перки, которые должны прокачиваться просто с лвлом, а не как отдельный перк.
Импланты прикольная идея, руки базуки))))), ноги с толчком при прыжке, глазики которые увеличивают криты/урон или дают видеть радиус взрыва, крепкий скелет чтоб таскать больше хлама который ты будешь собирать везде и всегда, операционная система (главное чтоб мозг не словил бсод) чтобы взламывать людей и технику и тд.
Стелс в этой игре просто шутка, стреляй с глушителя ваншотами пока враги не понимают почему у друга рядом голова взорвалась.
• Но было приятно играть в целом, 7 поставлю геймплею

Баги))))))))))
А тут меня нахуй все обошло стороной. Либо я неудачник, либо я пиздец везунчик. Потому что диких багов не было воообще, те баги которые в инете гуляют, я их вообще не застал. У меня бага было раз два, и все)

Графен бляяяяяяя такой секс, просто господи дайте мне 3090 я хочу лучи увидеть. На 1050ти игра не раскрывается, вообще в плане красоты. Сеттинг очень красивый, город такой привлекательный, красивый, огромный, блестящий. Я так хотел увидеть вживую графен на всю, что просто брал, включал все на ультра, и выключал fidelityfx cas и получал 10-20 фпс. Но статичная сцена города такая красивая :3
8гб озу впритык прям для игры, ссд рекомендую, только на ссд играл, хуй знает как будет на жд, скорее всего плохо.
• Графену ставлю 9, пушо оптимизация хромает (сужу не по себе, а по видюхам младше и сильнее)
(для 1050ти советую все на лоу, 1080р 70% статичного fidelityfx cas, и можно точность цветов, антизотропку и улучшенное освещение лиц включить на макс)

Музыка тут ахуенная.
Сел в тачку - по радио играет самурай;
Пошел пиздиться - заиграла динамичная музыка;
Грустный моментик - музычка такая трунь(
• Просто 10/10, врубайте радио на фул и катайтесь по Найт-Сити с ахуенным музлом)"
1609770852,Not done.
1609770790,"Before this game came out I wanted it to be good so badly, but the reality is, it just is not a good game. And in its current state I can't recommend it. Maybe pick it up on a sale. 

PROS:
Soundtrack - Subjective, but the OST is breathtaking IMO
Characters - The game is filled with well crafted and well written characters
Voice acting - Apart from Johnny Silverhand it's very good, I played male V
Story - The story is... OK, it's passable, but nothing to write home about
Loot - There is so much to find in this game from weapons to clothing to vehicles
Aesthetic - The overall art style and direction of this game is excellent

CONS:
Bugs - This is probably one of the buggiest games I have ever played
Performance - The game both performs and looks terrible on my PC (Despite surpassing recommended specs)
Gameplay direction - I was sold on an RPG, but the RP in this game is so watered down it isn't funny
Censorship - This was supposed to be a real vision of the dark future, but anything sexual in the game has been tonned way down, despite all the ads in the game being so sex focused. Seriously there is almost 0 nudity in this game, I want more, violence, nudity, sex, drugs, make this game dark and mature like it was intended
Content - The world feels empty, apart from quests there is nothing to do or enjoy in the world. you can tell this game was extremely rushed, so much content has been cut and we can only hope it gets added back in free updates
NPC/AI - It's bad, it's very bad. I can't even describe it, look up a video
Driving - Feels clunky, all the vehicles slide around and it is frustrating 
Character creation - ""You play as V"", literally, you play as the same character regardless of what you want this was seriously dissapointing because in their ads they made sure to say, ""be whoever you want"". Role playing is severely limited
Character customization - It's OK until you get into the game and find out you accidentally selected ""no nipples"" and then realize there is no way to change it in game.

Overall I think this game is ""meh"", I was sold on something completely different, this is not what they advertised and I feel lied to. I really do hope they continue working on the game and improve it overtime, because it does have potential, but in its current state I don't recommend buying it. Don't let your first impressions be soiled, wait it out."
1609770784,"yes there will be a lot of bus.... but that doesn't bothered me at all...
love all the quests, story, romance, and all the detail of the world"
1609770626,Dont believe the angry people. this game is fun as hell if you have the hardware to run it.
1609770551,"Just give it a go, the devs deserve that much at least"
1609770554,"A disgusting continuation of the industry's worst practices, by the one developer that was supposed to abstain from them.

Half baked, with tons of cut content, riddled with bugs, no qna whatsoever, development evidently was scrapped a few times, this is proving to be another case of No Man's Sky tactic of Claim Stuff and Hope No One Notices They Are Absent, but from a developer that presumably knew better. RPG elements are elementary at best, AI and Interactivity is non existent, dialogue choices truly do not matter, features missing left and right, a bloody montage instead of actually getting to know the game and Night City, unbalanced mechanics, skills, perks, randomized loot system in a game where fashion supposedly matters, unimaginative cyberwares, the worst optimization we have witnessed since Batman Arkham Knight. This game was not ready to be released, it was not even ready to enter an alpha phase. 

Thankfully the atmosphere, city and enviroments are up to par with what we were expecting, albeit completely underutilized and empty. 

Check back in a couple of years, either they will have added all the cut content, thus making it a playable blunder, or never bother with CD Projekt Red again, they have squandered the entirety of their trust earned with The Witcher. Management has to do some deep instrospection and collectively resign."
1609770336,side quests are some of the best parts of this game

1609770264,"Game feels unfinished... 

The ""immersive"" open world is lifeless and hollow outside of missions. It's just another Ubisoft's open world copypasted game. Everything you saw or heard in the trailer is just false.

It's a storied game, nothing more and nothing less. Almost everything about this game can be considered bad or mediocre at best from gunplay, customization, driving, enemy AI and RPG system. If you like story and don't care about gameplay, then sure, get this game.

I'd say, wait for like 20 plus patches like Witcher 3, then maybe the game can be considered good. Maybe."

it will be better"
1609769314,"Despite being a little buggy and some performance issues on older equipment, it is basicallyt a new GTA with a better story."
1609769102,It will be a great open-world RPG game once they fix everything in a couple of months.
1609768990,"I'm not angry, just disappointed. So disappointed I haven't touched it since release day."
1609768882,"So go into this game with the mind set that it will be about as buggy as any Bethesda game, however the story this game has is very unique and very good in my opinion. Not one side mission will feel like the same thing and this to me was the best part, because in a time where people really only want to do Ubisoft copy paste I appreciate it"
1609768753,It was mostly my brother who played (on my computer ;)) and he said it was top notch! Good day all.
1609768744,"BLUF: This is not the game it was supposed to be, but its not completely bad or hopeless.

Firstly, I kind of felt that the prologue associated with the life paths was too insignificant. Yeah, it gives you unique dialogue options, but it doesn't really have a big impact on anything later on. It just creates the illusion that the game has more depth than it actually does.

I noticed that Night City was not as open and explorable as I would have liked. To expect every single building and house to have unique content to explore is above and beyond what I personally would expect, but clearly there was meant to be more. There are so many ""LOCKED"" rooms and then rooms or buildings that are unlabeled. If you have any ideas about raiding ARASAKA or MILITECH outside of the story missions, forget it. Its all blocked off in an extremely lazy fashion. That leads me to believe that perhaps it was originally meant to be possible, but there just wasnt enough time to complete everything so they just hastily blocked a bunch of places off. I just got this feeling throughout my playthrough that this city was not anywhere close to complete.

Also, maybe I just missed them, but I felt the options for cyberware was very limited for some limbs. I never saw a legendary cyberware for legs for example. If I remember correctly, only KIYOSHI makes eye cyberware and it's functions seem more limited than I would expect. 

Yes, there are bugs and glitches present that ruin immersion at time like the infamous Police AI. Imagine sniping people at the top of a building where no one else can see you. One your first kill, you're immediately wanted and lo and behold a random beat cop appears at the top of the building you had to use your special leg cyberware to get to the top... Cops just appear like PS1 era AI. Oh and the most annying is the pop up information like for items or weapons or tutorials that WILL NOT DISAPPEAR!!!.

I personally felt the main story was too short. Some will disagree, but I prefer a longer story. The replayability is minimal I you ask me. Some people can mindlessly replay games and rewatch movies despite seeing the same content over and over again. I think the replayability is currently minimal for the average gamer.

The UI should have been better, but there are far bigger issues than the UI.

The music didnt inspire me, but I'm not a video game music buff.

Graphics were great as far as I can remember, so no complaints from me there.

If this were some no name GTA rip off set in the future, this would be an ok game, but it's not. The hype behind this game was immense, but just like many presidential elections, CDPR talked a big game and made many promises and didnt deliver. This is not the game we wanted and not the game the developers wanted to release (FACT). 

Had CDPR given up, I would not recommend this game, but it appears they intend to fix all the issues and possibly add in cut content. Assuming that CDPR will fix their mistakes, I think the game and its lore is worth investing in despite the current state of the game. 

Is this a must buy? Not right now
Will you regret buying this game? I doubt it

I still enjoyed my original playthrough and am halfthrough another. I just think CDPR should have done better."
1609768733,its riden with bugs but the story is great and should hopefully be fixed eventualy.
1609768711,good game play but very much glitch
1609768673,Immersive! Few bugs but overall good.
1610026314,"I don't even want talk about the ubiquitous bugs, the subpar open world experience or the lack of any meaningful choice. These problems have been extensively discussed in the other reviews you can find here or elsewhere. I'll focus instead on the pace of the story and the lack of balance and originality in the gameplay.

From a narrative standpoint, the first issue you'll come across is that the world and its lore are not gradually introduced to you. You won't have any time to get acquainted with the city and its customs, because the developers decided to throw pretty much everything at you at the same time. Right at the beginning there's a montage showing V, the main character, living his/her first six months in Night City, making friends and contacts you don't know anything about at that point. This ends up creating a sort of disconnect between the player and the main character: V is now supposed to know a great deal about his new world and the characters who live in it, while the player is still at a loss. You find yourself overwhelmed, still trying to realize what the fuck's going on around you, while complete strangers keep calling and texting you offering jobs, and cars and bikes you can't even afford.

If that's not enough, at the end of the first act there's an important revelation that completetly ruins the pace of the game. It's so important  and urgent in fact that everything else, side jobs and exploration, suddenly looks preposterous and out of place -- not that there are many interesting things to do anyway, since much of the content is just scripted filler. All this to introduce one of the most obnoxious characters ever created, Johnny Silverhand. Seriously, at some point I just wanted to rush the main quest just to get rid of his presence and focus instead on the other characters' way more interesting story arcs. To cut the chase, the main quest is simply horribly written. I mean, there's a couple of occasions in which you are left wondering whether the game skipped ahead because what's happening doesn't make any sense.

Let's talk about the gameplay now. The game doesn't  allow you to avoid conflict through persuasion or other means, except for a few inconsequential side missions. Sure, you can stealth your way ahead, but the enemies' predictable behaviour (i.e. scripted paths) and weird detection system don't make it exciting at all. The combat system is not engaging either, because it's utterly umbalanced and enemies are never a threat, not even the few bosses.

The skill tree is unnecessarily convoluted. There are literally dozens of passive perks that offer you nothing more than meaningless improvements to stats, like increased damage and whatnot. Only a few of them are actual abilities you can learn, such as [i]Hidden Dragon[/i] and [i]Dagger Dealer[/i], that respectively allow you to perform aerial takedowns on enemies and throw knives. Some of them are even totally useless. For instance, [i]Commando[/i] allegedly prevents your enemies to notice you when you are underwater. Problem is, there are no enemies around in the only mission where you are required to go underwater.

Speaking of the detection system, I still have no clue of how it works. On occasions you can literally walk past the enemies in plain sight. Sometimes this is due to a bug, because the game doesn't flag the enemies as hostile, but more often than not it's just because the AI is pathetically dumb.

Even the cyberware is frankly disappointing, considering that it was probably the most promising aspect of the game. Let's just say that the most interesting pieces of hardware allow you to slow time, double jump and shoot bullets from your wrist. That's hardly revolutionary. What's more baffling, however, is that your enemies and allies don't seem to want to use their cyberware. By scanning them, you can clearly see they have cybernetic implants on them but the only thing I can see them using is the cyberware that allows them to dodge bullets.

Hacking is poorly implemented. All you have to do is scroll a menu and choose how to win. It is simply OP and it doesn't take much effort to realize how you can exploit it. But really, hacking or not, there's no way you won't end up with an OP character by the end of the game and the dumb AI certainly doesn't help in this reguard.

I could keep talking about the annoying looting dynamics and the useless crafting system, but there's really no point. This game fails at pretty much everything. It's a bad RPG. It's a bad immersive sim. It's a bad open world. It's a bad shooter. And, aside from a few very well developed characters and side quests, it's just plain boring."
1609768638,The game is fun and has an interesting story with compelling characters. The bugs are a bit of a shame and can be a bit annoying at times though they certainly don't affect my playing experience.
1609768392,"Even with all the criticism and hate towards the game that I have seen on Reddit and other gaming sites, I have to say that I actually love CP2077.  It may have been hyped for all these years but on the PC I feel like it really does deliver.  Yes it does need patching but in its current state it is beyond playable for me and I have not run into any game breaking bugs yet, besides the one in the beginning of the game where a box fell on my feet and stuck me to the ground, but a quick reload of my last save fixed the issue.  I would give it a solid 8/10 and look forward to all the content in the future!

1609782416,"Doesn´t meet the standards of an AAA-game... Especially not a AAA-game with a several year long hype build-up, with promises of next-gen gaming, a rich and alive open-world etc. Combat unbalanced and skills are immersion breakingly buggy, clothing and crafting is an absolute joke, the list goes oooooon...
Story is as linear as watching a movie. A bug-riddled heap of steaming CDPR-poo.
Would have waited a couple of more years for them to finish their product instead of rushing it.

(Personal note/view:)
Dont even get me started on this ""my little pony shiny-happy-pastel colored"" garbage excuse for a gameworld.
Too bright, too clean, too much nonesens. Watch Bladerunner or Dredd if you are having  problems with your imagination!
William Gibson is turning in his grave, and the guy isn´t even dead yet!

Get it on sale. Maybe someday they´ll release a couple of dlcs, rebalancing patches, whatever."
1609768269,"Lots of bugs and performance issues but still very enjoyable, bit like a Bethesda game. With a little time and ironing this game will improve."
1609768209,dobra gierka polecam.
1609767952,"Looks great and runs great... most of the time. 

It's a good thing you can save often because you'll need it. There are still quite a few game breaking bugs."
1609767686,Great.dont care about public idiotic bullshit criticizing
1609767539,the game is alright and i do enjoy it but its far too easy no matter what style of game play you go for even if you have it on the highest difficulty also the game doesn't really require the use of any firearms as melee weps are so strong even tho i have zero perks in melee buffs >< that being said i do usually use my handgun to make the fire fights last abit longer than 10 seconds. hopefully in a few months they sort the balance out as at the moment im basically a grown ass man running around the city smacking kids about left right centre..
1609767332,"This game has had a rocky launch to say the least but i am not one to judge a game too harshly based on launch related issues as one of my favorite games of all time Fallout: New Vegas was a complete mess at launch. However it is still disappointing because of CD Projekt Red's reputation.

As far as the quality of the game itself, i got what i expected when to comes to CD Projekt. Excellent writing and characters. While not on the same level as The Witcher 3, it is still VERY good."
1609767135,"It started off great, but the more i played it the more i noticed how incomplete this game really is. I've run into countless immersion breaking bugs. The world while big and nice to look at, is lacking anything really interesting to do. The main story isn't all that interesting either. I'm maybe 5 hours from finishing it but i don't know if i can do it as i would be forcing myself to  complete a story that lost my interest a while ago. Maybe some day this game will be great, but it will be an uphill battle for CDPR to get it there."
1609766996,"A great single player RPG story set in the late 21st century. Very clever story line with so many interesting characters and branches to follow. A lot of choose your own paths to follow. Great open world with dangers hidden around the map. A lot to explore as your character develops strengths. I think this whole game is amazing. 

Because the world this games takes place in is so gritty, many of the characters are gruff and unfriendly, but most have a softer side as you get to know them better. 

Like the Witcher 3, I do wish it was a bit easier to fast travel across the map."
1609766983,the best
1609766918,meh
1609766837,"Cyberpunk has quite an immersive storyline, well-thought out characters and great gameplay.

Combat in Cyberpunk was enjoyable with a range of different weapons and modifications. This included optional choices of melee or stealth with hacking nearby technology which was an interesting aspect of the game. The actual combat system itself, i.e movement, hitmarkers, collisions, was quite standard and fitted the game well. 

I found myself not using the quick travel terminals as much but instead, was always robbing supercars and driving them on the streets to get to locations or just to relax. This I'd say, is a testament to the beautifully designed world of Cyberpunk. From bright lit lantern lights against the night sky in Little China to seemingly dystopian settings in Pacifica, driving through these places was a pleasurable experience especially because of the diverse radio stations offered (mainly Ritual FM xD). It was also interesting to notice that the game had fused different cultures together to offer possibilities of our future in the eponymous year. 

However, I felt it was a bit hard and tedious to grasp a hold of the plot at the start. For almost two of my first hours playing, I was not able to fully experience the ""open-world"" aspect of the game and was dumped with a lot of dialogue and story-telling. It felt almost like reading a book rather than playing a game, which I think is a major shortfall of the story. I only started to get immersed into the story after about 4-5 hours (about 1/5 of the storyline gameplay time), which I think is disappointing for AAA game. 

The game also packed in too much detail and splendor into the amount of characters, items and interactions which resultingly lead to the game feeling quite quantitatively dominant rather than shining through quality. Though teeming with life, it felt a bit lifeless. The NPC interactions felt very shallow, and though there are choices to be made in quests, dialogue and endings, the lack of engagement that NPCs have with their world really felt like they were ironically, robots. 

Finally, the graphics and the bugs and everything else that everyone seems to be complaining about hasn't really affected my experience that much. There are bugs like floating cars, things disappearing and stuck elevators, but games have always had bugs and glitches and I've always found it fun as a kid to explore or exploit them for fun. I've not yet had game-breaking bugs or corrupted saves, mainly just a few crashes (I just load back from quicksaves) and visual tearing when exiting from the map (GTX 1080 on Medium). 

Overall a great game, but quite overpriced.

1609767315,"After playing all side quests and story endings in Cyberpunk, I'd have to say that it's really a good game with a great story, interesting characters and all in this amazing world. Graphics are also really good that it makes the environment an immersive experience. Unfortunately, you need a high-end PC to get the most out of this game. I was only playing on Medium settings but I could already see that you can get extremely good visuals if your PC is capable of setting the graphics at Ultra.

Despite all the good things mentioned, I still can't deny that there are a [u]LOT[/u] of glitches and some are even game-breaking bugs even if the version I played already contains Hotfix 1.06. Hopefully CDPR releases patches that would address those so that the game can be enjoyed by everyone since it really has potential to be an even better game. The bugs just really make it a dealbreaker.

Overall, I'd still recommend this. After putting in more than 150+ hours in it, I'd say it was still a fun experience playing the game and worth the amount paid. I played for around 2 weeks and couldn't stop until I finished every single thing that can be done in Night city. And looking back, it was a good experience having finished all side quests and after seeing all the main story endings.

[h1] Just a few tips for those who plan to play this in the future:[/h1]

1. [b] UPDATE your drivers [/b] - so you avoid crashing/graphic glitches

2. [b] Always ANSWER the phone [/b]  when someone calls you and accept it if they offer a quest / ask help - as there are game breaking bugs where the caller will [u][i] never[/i][/u] call back anymore so that quest will end up getting stuck (and this can happen in the main quest)

3. [b] Keep SAVING. [/b] Have more than 1 save slot. I had 5 in my game. So you could go back to a previous save file if in case you encounter a bug and the game gets broken.

4. For those who don't mind minor spoilers --> [spoiler] YOU CAN SAVE TAKEMURA! There is an option to save him! It's just not that obvious [/spoiler]"
1609766600,Buggy as fuck and a very unfinished game with missing objects like a train station with working doors that open into a see through building cause yall were not bothered to finish the trains lol dont buy
1609766694,"I want to begin my review by saying, that I really liked Cp 2077. 
The way the game is played --> cyberware; weapons; dialouge felt really fun.
In addition to that NC is one of the atmospheric places for videogames ever, but do not expect a ""fun based city"" like in GTA. 
The badlands are a fine addition to the amazing city. Due to the size of NC and the badlands you need a car or a bike, which brings me to my first point of critique:
The driving physics are not well designed. It is almost impossible to drive in the tight streets of NC without crashing in anything while making the slightest turn.

But with enough mental power you will arrive at your point of destination. Those points are almost always Quest markers on the map. 
Talking about quest you have to devide the quests in two categories:
1. cool charakterbased story lines (well written; intersting;...)
2. go there --> kill this/ press f on a certain point --> go back
3. main quest --> super cool
In the secound categorie you will discover places like a shipyard or a old building, which tell there storys via computers, chips and enviroment. This is one of the many strenghs of Cyberpunk. The storys that are told in detail fit perfectly in the world: sometimes funny; sometimes sad, but always worth a look.

Completing quest grants you XP and SC. Through your playthrough you will level up your charakter. You can use these levelups to become better at one of 6 attributes. All of them represent a certain playstyle and have their reason to exists, it does not feel like one of these attributes is pointless. Leveling up attriubutes does not only grant u stats, but also enables dialouge options and the ability to use some weapons. You can freely combine the attributes. Within the attrivute trees you will find subdivisions. For example in the attribute ""Reflexes"" you will find the special tree for blades, but also for handguns and rifles. 
Useing the skills described by the subdivisions will grant you ability points. You can use those to skill within the skill trees. 
SC or Streed Cred indess infulences the world around you--> what weapons can I use/ what cyberware can I buy.

Overall the charakter system is well designed and fun to use.

But the most annoying thing about Cyberpunk are the countless bugs. If you are playing on a decent PC you will not have that many issues with performance. (in addition to that Cp has a great menue to adapt the game graphics to your PC)
The point is you will experience a lot of in game world bugs (the one that happened to me so far):
Flying cars 
Flying people
Loading issues --> bad textures 
Invisible guns
No sound
Weapons do not fire --> no bullets, but at some point you will suffer a lot of damage
side quest charakter glitches through the roof of a car, so that I can not talk to him and continue the quest
Enemys dont care at all about V --> I could just murder one after another and they would not care about it
...

These bugs are making cyberpunk not enjoyable longterm (Especally the queststopper bugs).
It is so sad to see the quality of such a great game suffer under these bugs because the game is well designed, has great mechanics, NC is super cool, but all that is drag down by bugs.
So I would recommand you to buy cyberpunk either when CD Projekts fixes the bugs or when Cp is on sale.
Have a nice day"
1609766421,BORG LADY SLASH
1609766223,"I had originally started writing a much longer Steam review for Cyberpunk 2077, but due to the 8000 character limit, I didn't get even halfway through, so I will condense it into some finer points.

Cyberpunk has a few problems. The biggest to me is the lack of content that was promised by developers but never made it into the final game. It's well documented in the development process just how much didn't make the cut and was removed before release. I hope they will reintroduce some of these features in later updates. The AI is hugely problematic and really breaks immersion. Crowds of NPCs will crouch and cower when you commit a crime near them, all doing identical animations, police spawn in infinitely near you out of nowhere, but don't follow or chase you when you flee the scene, the AI is truly a mess. Much of the games content feels meaningless, life paths have no effect on what actually happens in the story and merely offers you a different prologue or some lines in conversation that, again, have no impact on the actual game. Loot has similar issues where for you find yourself wearing a skirt, power scouter and a bandana because they offer 10 points more armour than the kevlar vest you've been wearing for the last 3 hours. This applies to weapons too and makes the loot system largely redundant, as you're swapping out weapons for a tiny numerical increase. Lastly I wanted to touch on optimisation. Although I personally didn't have many issues with performance, I did experience bugs, but all of them were fixed with 

Cyberpunk 2077 isn't all bad. I've seen lots of people complain about the RPG elements but I think these claims are baseless. The skill tree offers around 240 nodes for you to spec into, changing abilities or giving increases to different stats. A large number of choices in how you spec and the cybernetics will influence how all combat is handled. There are skill checks in Cyberpunk and whilst mostly they aren't influential to the game itself, your attributes are used in the world and dialogue too. Strength can be used to open doors or intimidate people, intelligence gives you more options in hacking, technical ability will allow you to deactivate cameras or pick locks. The visuals are absolutely stunning in this game, even in lower settings, the city looks amazing and feels amazing. The wonky AI can detract from the immersion as I previously said but judging the game solely on how it looks, it really feels triple A. The art design is right on the mark with a blend of eastern and western themes put on top of a city that really feels like a dystopian mega-city. The world-building feels truly handcrafted as little details are scattered throughout from the edges of the wastelands to the bustle of the inner city skyscrapers. The voice acting is also great throughout with main characters being well handled if not a little cliche in places, but I think it's fitting and just furthers the setting that they are in. The story feels compelling and seeing characters react to your plight, with the excellent voice acting, really cements the experience for me.

Side missions feature interesting characters, that feel easy to connect with and have interesting missions and stories. The gigs and scanner missions are more repetitive without as much narrative but as long as you don't leave them all to the very end like I did you won't mind them too much. The game has multiple endings, some of which can be influenced by your actions during the main game and whilst they are mostly somewhat depressing, they do tie off loose ends and feel weighty to the story.

This game suffered from people expecting the greatest video game of all time. It tries to do too much of everything and it suffers for it with everything being on a scale from just fine to excellent. What it does well, it does really well, what it doesn't do so well, requires further polish and additional content which CDPR do seem to want to work on and fix. All in all Cyberpunk is still a good game, the hype for this game was far too big for it's own good and between the devs over-promising and the higher ups forcing the game out before it's ready, it never stood a chance in the public eye. That doesn't absolve it of it's shortcomings but it does explain them."
1609766201,"Although this game had a very rough launch, I think that the game can be saved and is in the process of being saved due to the hotfixes. what would really make the game come around is realising all of the features we were promised that were cut. wall running, using someone as a human sheild and shooting them, having npcs daily life and making them super smart. adding back all that stuff will sureley fix the game, another thing to add is CDPR making a gta style multiplayer would be really find to see with all the cyberware. well thats my rant by the game its good"
1609766057,"- shallow gameplay consisting of scripted moments and kill + fetch quests
- absolutely no side activity as opposed to advertised
- almost non-existent AI
- shallow skill tree consisted mostly of percentage-based increase to stats

1609765461,"All of the extremely bad reviews for this game should be reserved for the console players only, for the game is absolutely  terrible on the ps4 and the xbox one; however, the game as a whole does need some polishing in obvious areas. Open world games such as this have a standard to be a realistic as possible, and there a few missing key elements in Cyberpunk that break the immersion that open world games normally have. The loot system could also use some love but for all intensive purposes, Cyberpunk is not that bad of a game and should be given a fair chance. I give it a solid B minus."

[b]Pros[/b]
- story
- characters
- aesthetics
- visuals
- funky clothing

[b]Cons[/b]
- small bugs
- gameplay to a small extend

Alright. Let me say this first, there are bugs in the game, and quick saves are your friend. But cd projekt does what it  does best in cyberpunk, incredible and engaging story telling, and engaging characters. This remains with you after you finish the game. 

The game is short, I have completed the game after faffing off for a while doing many side missions, which are great btw. But i get a feeling that this might be somewhat a conscious decision by the developer considering the gameplay directions available to you. Apart from the hacking skill tree which i think you have to put points into, the other skill trees are up to your decision and style. I want to do a second play through the game trying a cyber samurai build, it might suck but i will give it a shot.

Visually this game is incredible, the world is a beauty to look at. There are details everywhere if you stop to take a look.

The skill progression is decent, engaging enough without it being a grind.

Game play could be more polished. Gun play is a bit weird and takes a bit to get used to, but that also could be because the game i was playing before this was Doom, well... The hacking part of the game is interesting, using the right hacks at the right time against your enemies is crucial, trying to fry the brain on a drone is not going to work.

The AI is a bit developmentally challenged, but if there were hyperaware ai in the narrow corridors and indoors where a majority of the gameplay takes place, i feel every engagement will be a shootout. But that is a way you can play the game...

I would recommend this game 100%. I enjoyed it."
1609764354,"Played a bit, experienced some hilarious bugs (but nothing game breaking) and absolutely loved all the stories and NPCs!"
1609764339,Tough game at hard mode but definitely worth it. Be sure to buy the 3090 before playing as it really is the best gpu to use for this game
1609764299,"Game looks good, but it needs huge updates!
AI sucks.
Physics sucks
Money system is stupid"
1609763917,Just Yes
1609763779,"Of course there are many bugs.
Of course there were dumb managing mistakes of Cyberpunk (and it's staff) by CDPR.

But if you can see these things only: You are dumb too.

Cyberpunk 2077 is still a fucking great game, built with a huge effort by the CDPR-team over many years
and hating on them for the negative points, without mentioning/seeing the positive ones, is just bs.

I know, that the majority does see this issue clearly, but the other ones are pissing me off."
1609763610,You are big gay if you don't think it's 6/5
1609763487,"Right, so I don't normally leave reviews, but for this one I feel that I should.

If you go into this game with 0 expectations, its a solid 7/10 game, the story is good, graphics are A++, game play is decent, all in all a solid game.

BUT, considering the hype there was around this game, the promises, the advertising, the delays in release, the game falls way short of expectations, way way short.

I'll try to keep this review simple and spoiler free, what the game was advertised to be vs what it actually is:

[b]Is it an RPG?[/b] - Short answer is NO, it has RPG elements, but the game is more of an FPS than a full-on RPG, the origin backgrounds DO NOT add anything substantial to your character apart from adding different conversation options.

[b]Do choices matter?[/b] - ABSOLUTELY NOT, the game is linear and the only choices which will affect the ending are all taken during the final chapter of the game, so apart from completely ignoring certain side quests, how you choose to play your character will have no effect in the end as all meaningful choices are only presented in the game's final chapter.

What this game presents as 'choices' are in fact just different 'roads' which all end up with the same outcome, so if you expect to go into this game with choices having any significant weight towards the outcome of the story (like Detroit - Becoming Human), you will be sorely disappointed, and given how the game was advertised, you are right to be disappointed.

[b]Engaging story[/b] - This is where the game shines, the story is excellent and engaging, you will not want it to end, voice acting and animation are top-notch, the main characters are all well made, unique, and personally I think that its the best aspect of the game.

[b]Replayability[/b] - Close to none, as I said at the start the game is linear and more of an FPS than an RPG, the 'side-jobs' are just there to help you level, they are repetitive and don't add anything to the game, and the absence of a new game+ option doesn't help.

[b]Conclusion[/b] - The game feels like the developers bit more then they could chew, it tries to be a lot of things but fails to shine at any of them. The 'open world' is shallow and feels incomplete, the story is linear, you are presented with different 'roads' to pursue but it's an illusion as the roads all lead to the same destination.

I wouldn't recommend this game with its current price-tag, for me it's just a cool FPS with a great story, so grab it when it's on sale because the story is engaging and worth a play-through, other then that the game fell short of the hype and the initial expectations, it's a glorified first person shooter with some decent rpg elements."

1609763042,"I want to say right off the bat that yes, the number of bugs this game shipped with is totally unacceptable and the decision to release it in this state instead of delaying it until February/March has damaged CDPR in the eyes of a great many people (myself included).

BUT

I had a hell of a lot of fun with this game! 

If you enjoyed Deus Ex then this is basically that but open world. The main story missions are great but what surprised me was that the side missions were just as good too and actually have an impact on the options you have in the main story. In a time when I was getting really sick of open world games with heaps of meaningless side quests to do, this game nails the balance between having an interesting main questline and worthwhile (and some might even say better) side content. I felt engaged with this game from start to finish because I never felt like I was doing ""busy work"". You'll hear about how surprisingly short the main story is but the game makes up for it with its other storylines!

This game would be my GOTY if it weren’t for the state it shipped in. I never encountered any game breaking bugs but I did have to reload quick saves more than I should have to get the game working again. The game is getting two big hotfixes this month and in February so if the bugs concern you, wait a few more months. 

TLDR version:
GOOD
+Main story and side content (The characters are fantastic)
+Night City looks great and is atmospheric
+Lots of playstyle options with skills (Hacker/Brawler/Stealth/Heavy gunner etc)
+Really good music (Samurai music in particular)

BAD

1609763011,"While the game does have its flaws, Cyberpunk 2077 delivers a vast open world of side quests, random events, glitching cars that blow up, throwing your body across the map because you ran at an angle on a sloped surface, and non-stop action. With 70+ hours on hand (most of them had Steam disabled as I didn't want to update to the next patch until their own issues were settled), I've still not come close to even completing 50% of the main story. I've fought the law. I've fought the law breakers. I've fought myself (Hi, Johnny.) -- and my little health inhaler got me through it all. Pick this up on sale or grab it after some time has passed. You definitely won't be NOT busy."
1609762835,quadra best car
1609762759,Yes a few bugs. But all in all a great game!
1609762734,"TLDR; if you already have FO4 or GTA5 this game won't give you anything new, but if you don't have those game get Cyberpunk 2077 instead. If you've been waiting for a game better than Witcher 3, forget it.

I'm a massive GTA/Fallout fan and Witcher 3 is by far the best game I've ever played so I couldn't wait to get my hands on this. I'm mildly disappointed to be honest. It's a really good game but I expected more. Think GTA5 with cyber body mods, cruising around the city doing repetitive missions to level up weapons/skills/gear. The difference is we already had games like that since 2013, so although Cyberpunk 2077 adds stunning graphics and better emotional immersion, it should/could have been so much more. The main positives are the incredible music and animations, plus really good storytelling and emotional engagement (even better than Witcher 3). I particularly enjoyed the immersive and intimate relationship building with key characters. It took me about 20 hours to really understand how everything worked (crafting, leveling, skills, stealth etc.) then I spent another 100+ hours playing the main quest up to the point of no return and finishing all side missions before finally finishing the main quest.

In particular my major peeves are:
1. No warnings for selling/scrapping iconic gear/weapons. I got rid of them early in the game because they looked too difficult to upgrade using the extremely rare rare parts (I have 10x more legendary and epic parts than rare parts) and I saw them listed in the crafting menu so assumed I could craft new ones later when my skill was high enough. Nope. Now I'll never be able to craft a Five-O or Crash and no way to get them back ever.
2. Skill trees take the whole game to get anything useful. Now I've finished the main quest and all side missions and I finally can craft legendary weapons. Thanks for nothing.
3. Night City is full of buildings and NPCs but you can't actually DO much with the world. 99% of doors are locked and 99% of NPCs repeat the same lines randomly. So full yet so empty. Yawn.
4. Nothing else to spend my money on. I have enough money to buy all the vehicles but I only bought the good ones. Now I have legendary gear/weapons I can't spend money on other things e.g. apartments, choppers, boats etc.
5. I can crash my car/bike at any speed into any obstacle with no penalty, so there is no benefit to driving carefully or skillfully - now I just screech around at absolute top speed and re-summon my vehicle when it becomes too bashed up.
6. Vendor trading UI when buying or selling multiple items (using a game controller). Clickity-clickity-clickity-clickity-clickity-clickity-clickity-clickity-clickity-click goes my controller button. Aaaargh! So I just had to use my mouse/keyboard for buying/selling.
7. End game SUCKS. The end game story line and missions are exciting but then the final stupid cringy cut scenes left me disappointed and irritated. Worse still, I'm back in Night City with no more missions and nothing else to do (all side missions finished) and I didn't get to keep any of the really cool gear from the final mission, except one weapon which is way below my current legendary piece. Nothing to do anymore except walk around bored and randomly shoot civilians. Can't upgrade my apartment, can't get a flying vehicle, can't race. can't gamble, can't fix missions from a certain club etc. etc. No point exploring because can't open any doors or talk to any people."

1609762127,"[b] Game completed on patch 1.06
122 hours played, NCPD hustles, GIGs, side stories and main story completed.

There will be minor spoilers from the prologue, which is about the first 5 hours of the game.[/b] 

[h1]Goooooooood morning, Night City![/h1] 

The game starts you of with two of the features that was heavily marketed as deep RPG components defining your experience in Cyberpunk 2077. 
Character customization and life paths.
Both of them fall flat throughout your adventures in Night City.

[b]Character creation[/b] was terribly underwhelming. Your choices range from preset tattoos and piercings to these or those eyes and ears. The whole thing about customizable genitals was also just 3 sizes for either boobs or penis, which you'll never see again outside your inventory. But the biggest sins would be that you don't look anything like what you designed once you're in-game, and you can never change anything from the character creation from the moment you start the game. Not even tattoos or hairstyle.
[b]Life path[/b] is a choice you make once, either Nomad, Street kid or Corpo. No matter your choice it will consist of about 15 minutes of introducing you to some basics about gameplay and Jackie, one of many excellent characters in the game.
As for the rest of the game, life paths give you some flair in dialogue choices, but nothing of severe consequence. 
All in all another underwhelming feature.


[h1]Worst place to live in America..[/h1]

After your life path plays out, your rushed introduction to Night City is rushed even more, with a montage of cut scenes that shows you 6 months of adventures with Jackie and various other characters. It was by far the most jarring part of the story, as the game now suddenly expects you to know and care about a heap of characters that has had about 5 seconds of screen time.
And when you finally step out of V's apartment and into the open world of Cyberpunk 2077...its beautiful, so long as you don't look too closely that is.
While the graphics, style and design of Night City is a work of art, it's held back a heap of unpolished features like NPC systems and behaviors, lack of traffic AI, a botched wanted system and no dynamic events and things to discover. Once you have seen the first area, you have seen most of it. 

Some missions early in the prologue also showcase these grand moments of what Night City could have been, Trauma Team being saving angels descending from the sky and MAX-TAC being similar angels of death. These exciting things never happens outside scripted missions.
There is also a big tutorial for using Brain Dances which is a sort of virtual reality recorded from a character's perspective. It's a really cool feature, but only used a handful of times throughout the whole game. 
Everything you want to do in Night City is neatly marked on your map with yellow symbols, in the form of either ""side biz"" which is usually fleshed out mini stories, or the more generic ""gigs"" which are a variation of kill/rescue/sabotage. 
Blue icons are just repetitive shooting galleries not worth your time unless you really enjoy the core gameplay loop.

The open world aspect of Cyberpunk 2077 quickly became a somewhat tedious and unnecessary loading screen going from mission to mission where the meat of the game is.

[h1]..main issues..[/h1]

Almost all core gameplay mechanics in Cyberpunk fell flat. Gunplay is OK, with most of the weapons handling the same depending on type. Melee combat is janky and unsatisfying. Hacking is point and click to upload damage or effect, it gets super repetitive. Cyberware feels like an extension of perks, with little impact on gameplay systems or otherwise.
Enemy AI is terrible. No self-preservation or communication. All of the enemies feel the same, doesn't matter if it's gang members or corpo guards.
The gameplay loop mostly plays out like this -Kill everything, loot everything, sell or dismantle everything. 
It gets old real quick, as interesting loot or enemies are few and far between.
Driving has terrible handling, and performance even with top tier hardware is quite bad when driving in third person.

Clothing was a bit meaningless, as they are tied to stats, and you never see much of them. There are mod slots for them, but it only becomes very relevant if you level up your crafting to max.

Attributes and perks are a mixed bag. Tech and Intelligence is necessary if you either want to play with crafting or hacking. The rest, Body, Reflexes and Cool is mostly just incremental upgrades to DPS and other stats which won't affect gameplay much.
I ended my playthrough at level 50, but I entered the point of no return with 12 perk points not allocated. At some point I didn't feel they did enough to warrant my attention.
Street cred was also just a progress bar towards unlocking more gigs and merch. It did not affect your presence in the world.

[h1]..yet everyone wants to live here[/h1]

Back to the meat of the game, which is its saving grace. Its fantastic characters and amazing stories. The voice acting, animations, attention to detail and set pieces are what you should play this game for. And it all makes the less fantastic open world, gameplay and systems worth dealing with. 
[b]A gig spoiler ahead:[/b]
I want to highlight a moment in my playthrough that blew my mind.
[spoiler]There is a GIG where you are tasked with retrieving a Brain Dance for a client. In the server room you will come across a father and son enjoying a BD, and if you have been paying attention it's not the legal kind. It's BD's about kids.
Now you have a few choices. Sneak past them, do your job and leave. 
Or, confront them, which will play out some dialogue options.
After talking with them, I was not satisfied with what they had to say, and decided to play judge, jury and executioner. 
I point my gun at the son and pull the trigger. His head explodes and the fathers reaction is visceral. It's such a great moment my stomach churns, and I'm almost questioning what I've done. 
Though this gig outcome had no bearing on the rest of the game, it was a great moment of player agency and story telling.[/spoiler] 

[h1]A city of dreams[/h1]

To sum it up, I enjoyed my time with the game, despite its many shortcomings.
CDPR definitely bit of more than they could chew, as there are a lot of half-baked ideas present in the game.
Some cut content still has pieces of it left in the game, and it's clear that they wanted to expand on the gameplay systems and a living breathing city more.
But alas, the stories and characters carried the rest of the game to be an enjoyable experience, which I do recommend.
All in all, a very good game, that had the potential to be a great game, if not the very best."
1609761743,It has some glitches and overall unfinished things but overall. I love the storyline and the aspects of the city.
1609761727,my machine ran game just fine and i love it great story on second play through at moment
1609761546,"100 hours passed as blink of an eye. I already cannot recall last time playing with such enthusiasm and being that submerged in atmosphere - maybe old BioWare games in pre-EA era when grass was more green and trees were big. I want to say huge thank you to studio who has put so much love and effort in every small detail in unbelievably huge city. I cannot stop being amazed how much meaning and consideration is put in everything - from main quests plots to a small graffiti somewhere on deserted landfill which potentially could never be seen by anyone. 
And yeah - fk the Internet rant. I miss time when people were not forming their opinion based on comments in forums and memes on reddit. Never have read those, just launched the game and played 100 fascinating hours. This game goes to my personal ""Greatest of its times"" fame hall even if whole world would would keep complaining. Thank you, CD Projekt ! I hope guys at studio also are hearing those ""thank you"" and know their unbelievable work is appreciated and loved by many despite the fashionable rant trend"
1609761461,"CDPR Did lie a lot with what they said about this game before it came out but I have no idea why because it isn't a bad or mediocre game by any means. In my opinion the side-quests is really where this game shines though the main story is still very good. Would I suggest this game? yes if you are into games for their story, lore, and some fun in a beautifully crafted and diverse single player world yes."
1609761380,"Good on PC, Bad on Console, So overall, good. :) #PCMasterRace"
1609761270,"Still worth the money, amazing game at it's core with minimal glitches and fewer crashes than some of my other games. 9/10 would recommend"
1609761260,"Look we all know the game has hella bugs but that's only because the developers were rushed into releasing. The game performed pretty well for me, but only because I went on reddit and learned how to unlock my game on my computer since they are capped at console settings for whatever reason. Go on reddit and fix the issue and you'll enjoy this beautiful game that took 7 years to make."
1609761247,"Full of bugs, The main story is really short.
Its still a fun game and worth the price"
1609761102,"I love the immersive gameplay, granted there are bugs that can be jarring at times, the writing and overall experience is definitely worth the money"
1609760998,"Love the graphics and dynamic choices one can make in the game, thus far."
1609760882,This game has too many  bugs that are able to ruin the experience to anyone...even with a decent GPU.
1609760790,"unplayable
game keep crashing and buggy"
1609760727,"Whilst the game is a buggy mess that CDPR definitely needs to clean up, especially on consoles, this game has been an absolute blast for me to play through. The main story is an absolute rollercoaster, the side missions are far, far better than your average Ubisoft fetch quest (as in they actually have their own arcs and gameplay mechanics specific to side missions), and whilst the bugs do take you out of the immersion of living in 2077, I haven't experienced a single crash so far. And even if this game was full of Ubisoft side quests, it would still be an amazing game, mainly from the main story and environment in which you play in. It's an absolute blast and I found myself taking the long way to go to an objective, just to see what was there, what I could find. And the immense amount of detail that CDPR has managed to fit into 62.3GB is very impressive, and makes taking the long route, and going down every hallway an absolute blast.

I am also very happy that ray tracing does not require an RTX GPU, as all RTX GPU's offer from your standard GPU is special acceleration cores that greatly improve ray tracing performance, so in theory an RTX GPU is not required for ray tracing, and CDPR has been one of very few developers to allow ray tracing to run on non RTX GPU's.

Overall, I'd give Cyberpunk 2077 a 9.5/10 on PC and a 4/10 on consoles."
1609760862,The best and most disappointing game of the year in one
1609760328,"Cons:
- Not what was promised. The city is not alive, it's a buggy mess. Overall, it feels like an early alpha.
- There are no impactful choices that alter your gameplay experience or questing in a significant manner. 
- The main story, no joke, is no more than an hour of actual gameplay. Yes, it can be finished that quick if you hurry it up. 
- the side-quests are mostly forgettable and not engaging or challenging. Unlike the Witcher 3, Skyrim, oblivion etc. 
- 6 possible endings, all disappointing.  
- There's something extremely disappointing in this game, hard to explain, there is very little player engagement.                              
Pros: 
- Keanu Reeves (Silverhand) plays a very cool character that I got attached to.
----------------------
Conclusion: 
Is it worth playing through it ... honestly, for me it felt more like a task than entertainment."
1609760232,"The game is good. you should like it to if you are interested in Sci fi worlds,RPG and shooter games."
1609760186,Amazing Main Story and good Sidestorys. A little overwhelming in the beginning but many options for individual gameplay! Hope the next Updates will bring more story and missions.

1609759155,"after 100 hours in this game all i have to say is currently the game is alright, it's not great, it's got a lot of bugs and the main story is very short but it makes up for it with really great side quests and characters, i do love the world the world really is the best part of the game, driving in the heart of night city at night is incredible, but also fuck some of the ads are so fucking weird, i fucking hate the mix it up ad especially, the combat is also alright i mean the melee combat is complete garbage, i would say it's very like fallout new Vegas's combat minus vats, driving is also pretty alright, if you haven't noticed i think the game is alright, it really is though it's not goty material or anything, i still reconmend the game, if it's something that interests you i'd recommend waiting for all the bugs to be fixed or a price drop"
1609759105,scam
1609758714,"I liked and enjoyed this game. Yes there are some bugs, but no more than I have seen in many other newly released games. All the hype has generated some unrealistic expectations. Plus ça Change...

What did surprise me was the lack of content. This is CDPR after all... and Witcher 3, hype and unrealistic expectations not withstanding, the game is quickly over. Any other company's game and this would be no surprise... content done, move on. But CDPR? I never thought I would close out all the clear and obvious side missions so quickly. The main story was also surprisingly concise - this I don't mind but side missions etc? I was expecting more.

So... caveat emptor? Nah. Buy. Play.  Enjoy and when - as is rumoured - they add in the supposed missing content later in the year, play it again. And then add in the DLC that is forthcoming. And play again. See where this is going? How many times did you replay Witcher 3? Exactly.

Just don't expect another Witcher 3 with all its depth and breadth (yet?). CP2077 is not there yet but it is still an enjoyable game.

And what's with the Keanu hate? There is absolutely nowt wrong with his performance and indeed he adds a quality to it all that is unique to him; this is a good thing. 

I am running on a PC spec just above the minimum. I can't get all the bells and whistles and sometimes my frame rate makes me suicidal but its entirely playable."
1609758456,"A far cry from what was promised, but still very enjoyable gameplay and visuals.

Looking forward to future updates and mods to unlock this games full potential."
1609758309,"Its grate, love it :D"
1609758300,This kinda trash
1609759011,"Two words... What Happened?

I am so damn disappointed... 

After all the time waiting, and all the delays. This is what we get?

How do you go from making a masterpiece like the witcher 3, to this?

Its... just so damn broken... there is so much missing. 

Never has a world looked so full, yet in reality is so empty.

I don't normally write these things, but in this case I HAD to.

Gone Gold? ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? WHOEVER APPROVED THIS GAME IN THE STATE THAT IT'S IN, IS A COMPLETE AND UTTER FUCKING IMBECILE! THEY SHOULD BE FIRED IMMEDIATELY!  

You fucked us over, Plain and simple.

The only redeeming quality, is the soundtrack."
1609757981,My little sister hits harder than Jackie's death
1609757940,"Its overall great. Sure its buggy but still better then a Bethesda game and CDPR is more dedicated to fixing the issues. If you have your doubts wait about a month from its launch and you should enjoy a stable, satisfying experience."
1609757748,https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2349246762
1609757719,Fun game.
1609757611,"Hundreds of copy-paste missions. 1/4 of the promised features. Gameplay poorly balanced, equipment not doing what it's supposed to, abilities not working, non-existent AI."
1609863785,"Alright, so I've been trying to write a review for this game for the last couple of days but couldn't put my feelings about this game into words properly, here goes I guess?

If I had to sum up the gameplay, it would be a mix of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, the Borderlands loot system, Deus Ex and Fallout NV.

Sure, it has bugs (none of them game-breaking in my 100+ hours of gameplay, but yeah there are quite a few of 'em) but underneath all of the flaws is a genuinely great game with SUPER likeable characters, an engaging story and lots of fun side-content. However, it's hard to go deeper into why I love the game so much without spoiling stuff, so I'll talk about my 'issues.'

My main gripes, really, are that you can tell that some parts were obviously cut during development (potential faction system, empty 6th attribute slot, some character deaths which I felt happened a bit too early in the story/could have been avoided etc. etc.), the driving takes A LOT of getting used to and even when you do get used to it, you'll be crashing into things left and right. The hacking, cyberware and skill-tree systems also feel a bit lacklustre with the former being JUST stat increases and not much else, and the way they gate romance is REALLY strange (voice determines your pronouns and some characters prefer specific body type and voice combinations.) I mean, I kinda get it but I feel it could have been done in another way. I'm also not a fan of splitting the character creation into ""Male-looking person"" and ""Female-looking person"", when the body-type selection could have just been omitted and replaced by a base character that you can edit any way you like while also adding an option for selecting your pronouns instead of having voice determine that. I think this would also allow for more freedom in character creation, which is always a plus.

Now, I realise that my gripes section is a lot longer than my praise for the game but believe me when I say that this game is worth playing. The second I finished my first playthrough I literally started another character and did it all over again.

In short, do I recommend this game? Yes, wholeheartedly. I love this game. Play it."
1609757471,"15 hours so far so good, yeah there're some glitches and bugs, but not really affecting overall gameplay.
first 3-4 hours a little bit slow, because of the tutorial and talking, but after that, the story start to build up pretty good"
1609757415,was expecting it to be longer tho lmao
1609757402,"Lots of bugs and errors, But I do like the storyline."
1609757260,"it is good and is getting better and better.
"
1609757040,"Good game yet...feels like it's missing a lot of things.

Good:
Decent combat
Fairly well written story
Good voice acting
Great graphics...most of the time 


Bad:
AI is kinda dumb
There isn't much to interact with outside of quests
Limited romance options 
Shallow NPCs
No parkour

"
1609757015,"Very good game with a good story
"
1609756816,yeah
1609756815,A lot of fun. What's all the bitching about.
1610039941,"keanu reeves and that bright yellow colour


will make you cry"
1609756544,still managed to enjoy this game despite not being able to receive my cyber bris
1609756410,"Expansive world. Hilarious bugs. Intriguing story.

Got a rig that can run it? Play it."
1609756253,"Albeit quite buggy and has a chaotic beginning, once you get used to the mechanics, the city, and complete Act 1 to unlock side quests with strong characters and story, the game becomes super immersive and fun. And none of the bugs I've encountered so far were game breaking."
1609756074,great storyline
1609823008,"The hype is real and this game is spectacular. It is like the love child of Deus Ex and GTA with the progeny only getting the good bits. It's like RAGE 2 but not set in a boring old wasteland. It's set in an incredibly detailed world that is actually fun to explore. The game also resembles Hitman if you decide to mostly use stealth. This game is so many great games all rolled into one. But it also has such an unique feel. 
 There's the occasional weird gameplay interrupting bug that the internet always can help with. Just make sure you save often. The game certainly needs a polish to fix up quite a few glitches but I'm sure the developers are onto it. 
 My computer is not high-end by any means and my graphics settings are at the most set to average but this game still looks great."
1609755892,"overrated, overhyped, trash story."
1609755891,This game is complete dogshit massively over hyped and a embarrassment to the creators
1609755830,"Honestly, I love this game.  It has compelling characters, great acting and writing.  It is a beautiful, interesting and confronting world to experience.  One day when it isn't absolutely riddled with frustrating bugs that make you have to reload your save every few minutes It could be game of the year material"
1609755537,haha pc sound like airplane now
1609755436,"Gioco davvero bello e ben fatto. La storia è ben presentata e la grafica è di altissimo livello. Tuttavia, a quasi un mese dall'uscita rilevo la presenza di alcuni bug non proprio piacevoli..."
1609757360,"Cyberpunk 2077, without the bugs and glitches, is a good game. Heck, most of my playtime, I didn't really experience any game breaking bugs and I'm playing on a 3 year old Gaming Laptop. There were some visual bugs and sometimes a quest wouldn't complete but I just reloaded an earlier save and I was good to go.

I spent more than a hundred hours exploring the city and doing side quests. In that time, I realized how shallow the game is. Looking past the bugs and glitches, I saw how it is not the same game that CDPR has been marketing all these years. More than half, if not all, the features that they presented during their Night Wire events, before the release, are missing. 

They claimed a next-gen experience and that CP2077 will revolutionize the RPG genre, but instead, they delivered a mediocre game. When compared with GTA5, Watch Dogs, Red Dead Redemption 2, Fallout NV, heck maybe even Fallout 4, this game is far from revolutionizing anything.

If you are deciding to buy this game in hopes that whatever the Marketing team of CDPR fooled us with, is in the game, then, I strongly suggest you don't. Maybe wait a couple of months. Heck there are even rumors from a supposed ""CDPR Dev"" that by June 2021, all the missing features will be added to the game.

I enjoyed most of the hours I spent in game, but unlike Fallout or The Elder Scrolls, CP2077 doesn't give me that replayability factor. I bought the game because it was advertised and marketed as a next-gen RPG that will put something extraordinary into the table, instead, here I am, still waiting..."
1609755413,A thing of beauty
1609755259,"I'm gonna make it short 
Story: 10/10  i love every single story they put
Bug: 10/10 sometimes it can be hilarious
Quest: 7/10 
The point is, this game have a good story that make you involved and every choice you make matters. if you're like me who don't really care about bug and focus on story i really recommend it but if you wanna have full experience of the night city, wait till it got fixed. So far I'm really enjoying this game"
1609755107,"If someone can name one memorable set piece from the story I'll be amazed. 

The game is 80% walking/talking cutscenes. 

Looks pretty when it works and that's about it."
1609755046,Can't wait for the release of the full game!
1609837018,"I spent so much time for this game and continue playing even though I finish it. Stories, graphic, theme, characters, quests, soundtrack, combat, weapons are great. Developers pay good attention on details. It has a lot of stories and side quests although there are bugs as well. These bugs get on my nerves. But they are offset by fun from game playing, which made me feel relaxed. The romance system ,uhmmm, is good work, CD Project Red.
As you can see, there is nothing perfect in this world but your game is superb and attracts players to play it all day. 
9/10 Enjoy!!!!"
1609754975,The game is fun and has a great story and cast of characters. Game play suffers because of the bugs but I have not personally run into anything game breaking. Most of the bugs are immersion breaking but nothing that would make me alt-F4. Don't expect a next gen experience but do expect a pretty good over all gaming experience.
1609754944,"its not what it was promised to be, but if you take it for what it is, it is good game."
1609754841,DIS GAEM IS GUD PEPLE SAY IT NO FUN FRUM BUGS BUT BAGS ARE FUN
1609754796,"the immersion in this game is immense, story and soundtrack are excellent, gameplay/combat are fluid and unbelievably fun mid to late game atleast with Reflex maxed out (Assault/Handguns/Blades)

game atm is easily a 9/10, will be a 10/10 as soon as they slowly fix the bugs which (on pc) does not ruin the experience most of the times it results in a good laugh

Cyberpunk 2077 is definitely one of the best games I’ve ever played and will be even better in the future with the upcoming patches"
1609754752,this game has its ups and downs but to me its a game that i can easily come back to when they fix and tweak a couple of things
1609754740,"Amazing story telling, world, RP aspect, absolutely a 10/10 game if not for the performance issues. I'm on a mid range pc so my graphics looks like a ps2 sometimes but other than that, I've had 1 bug that made me reset, which was an npc not spawning in the first few hours, and nothing after that, bug-wise. I'd buy it again if I had to."

1609754331,"good story and game, some bugs but nothing major"
1609806929,"This game started out extremely strong for me in the story; but after act 1 it took a turn for the worst In my opinion. The game is also not a full RPG it also doesn't have different paths in the story until the very end.

The gun play is some of the best I have seen in an action adventure with RPG like features in it; the melee combat is a little sloppy though.

The game is also lacking content and features at the moment.

In the end I cannot recommend the game in its current state; with the story that fell flat and lack of content."
1609754213,"Cyberpunk 2077 is a great game, although not perfect, I enjoyed my time in it. I want to highlight the main story and secondary stories and the world of Night City, which are well developed. I had a great time during my second pass through the game and other choices I made. The game has bugs and glitches, but I think the developers will remove them in the subsequent patch and from my point of view they were not game-breaking.

I'm looking forward to more DLC content and other stories from the world of Cyberpunk 2077.

Pros
* Main story
* World Night City
* Feeling of the living world and city
* Variety of secondary quests
* Skill tree and separate skill progression

Cons
* Enemies are not very smart
* Not wholly balanced crafting, it's too OP.
* Vehicle handling
* Cops / Criminal activity

What I miss in the game
* Reputation system
* Scaling enemies
* Better predictability drop of items and his quality (for example, static number of slots by the quality of items)"
1609754195,ehhh buy it if you dont mind that new game feel in a year it will probably be a different game.
1609754155,"Runs great on my 3090. Encountered minor bugs, nothing too bad. Great game so far."
1609754099,"shit game, not because of the bugs, the core game is just boring and not what was promised."
1609753936,Absolutely awesome game!
1609753797,Fun game. some updates would help but i belive it's coming. a little hard to run
1609753763,"I like the game but doesn't live up to the hype. When they removed dynamic shadows for NPC's in the trailers I knew they would downgrade the whole game to make it playable on current mainstream hardware. 

I stopped playing game during the Takemura mission because I got bored of him talking so much. Haven't gone back to it since. I'll come back once they update it with purchasable properties or some other major feature they promised."
1609753736,one of the best games i ever played
1609753719,Fun Game.
1609753393,fun
1609753288,"This game is a solid 8/10. 

Yes, they promised a lot of things that are not in the game. Yes, there are a few bugs. Yes, some of the story feels rushed.

However that doesn't mean it killed the game or it flopped. Nay, the game is memorable. Every hour I spent on Night City was a delight. All the characters I've met were fantastic. The city itself is sublime. The only possible game that comes close and beats the atmosphere of the game is Red Dead Redemption 2. Nevertheless, if you are interested in the game and you wanna delve into a new exciting world (isn't that why we, gamers, play in the first place?) that will make a mark into your mind, Cyberpunk 2077 is the game. 

I feel like most of the complaints people are always talking about are overblown and for the most part, when I require about their own gameplay, they've never played the game. Folks, play the game and see it for yourself. Obviously, the console versions are in a much worst state but this is the steam version we're talking about.

Let me say it again, the game is a delight and so memorable. You can get lost for hours. Immerse yourself into the world, do not rush it. I've heard people playing the game in 30 hours and complaining about the game, don't listen to them. They didn't play it properly. The sidequest is as important as the main quest. It's a shame CDProjekt doesn't emphasize its importance within the game.

Seriously, play the game and see it for yourself.

I played this game using Shadow, Boost edition."
1609753125,"Amazing story.

Extremely addictive.

in my opinion its the best game yet to be released."

1609752566,"Incredible graphics, fantastic aesthetic, absolutely heart-ripping story, and amazing soundtrack.

Woeful crafting, terrible open world features, bugs and glitches galore, and obviously gutted features.

Completely and utterly worth buying just to play the main story through to its numerous endings. Much maligned and overhyped but still a damn good game. I look forward to the 'free DLC'...

Make sure to complete (not fail!) the questlines for Rogue, Judy, Panam, Kerry, River. Saving Takemura is a good idea too. Go into the end blind, then lookup how to get the other endings."
1609752356,Despite the occasional visual glitches the incredible storyline and character writing makes it worth it!

1609750316,Fun. Flexible. Entertaining. Everything I want in an RPG
1609750300,"After 94 hours of gameplay and (finally) completing the main mission once I'd excercised enough of my perfectionist, ""complete every single damn side quest"" playthrough with the Corpo start, I have to say this game has been fantastic. 

I was fortunate enough to play Cyberpunk 2077 with a 3080 and a 5800x on 1440p, so I personally have not had major issues with being able to run the game, like a lot of others have, so just be aware of this. Have had it on ultra/psycho ray tracing, ultra settings for graphics and I have been getting around 65-70 FPS indoors and around 45-55 in highly populated areas at worst. 

At the start of the game, it was a bit overwhelming at first getting tons of calls and texts from fixers and other NPCs in the game, but stick with it as it does eventually die down. 

I did find myself a bit bored trying to drive to every other side quest across the map once the main side missions had been completed, but again, this is not unusual for an open world game after you've completed most of the important missions.  

There are bugs in the game, the hotfixes definitely improved things, but there are immersion breaking moments, such as a pistol being lodged in Jackie's head at a very emotional scene (that was hilarious), cars randomly flying into the sky whilst driving through the badlands or the inner city and instant weather changes in certain areas of night city, but largely I haven't come across game breaking bugs or glitches and have managed to complete every mission without a hitch really. I suppose it's luck of the draw and what constitutes a game breaking bug for you; I've played much worse games in terms of bugs myself so Cyberpunk hasn't really been an issue for me. 

The gameplay is fairly straightforward, point and shoot/slash/block in combat, helps if you move around a lot (though I've played on the hardest setting for a bit of a challenge which was fun).

The music throughout the game is excellent, I feel they've really nailed it with the combat music too - I've tried to play stealth/sniper but that combat music awoke the beserker in me and I just had to become cyber-Rambo instead. 

I would say the crafting isn't the best, and in all honesty, you can play without spending a single point in crafting to get good gear and by the time I put enough points in to craft amazing legendary gear I've completed the majority of the game and didn't find much use for the skill points.

The main thing that stands out in Cyberpunk 2077 as to get my recommendation though is the storytelling. Seriously, it's wonderful. You start to get emotionally attached to each character in the storyline, it evokes an emotional response in your choices and often I've found myself really caring for some of the main characters or really hating them, which doesn't happen often for me in games! 

Don't start playing this game with the view that it's one continual and linear story, each side mission you do outside of the main mission is essentially  a major tale in itself and whilst not all are relevant to the main mission, you still get deep storytelling and a real sense of human connection to the characters.

I definitely recommend this game, probably not at the £50 asking price (I pre-ordered this) as there are still quite a few bugs and issues with running the game for a lot of people, so unless you have the most recent hardware you're likely to run into a lot of performance and graphical issues for now and the bugs can be hit and miss for people. Still, it's a great game if you don't run into any major issues!
"
1609750102,beautiful graphics.   fun game
1609750095,"First of all save whenever and wherever you can. Should be like the golden rule to any RPG anyways. But the reason for it, until the devs fix it, are because of the all the glitches. Other than that, the game is well... PRREEEMMM.

When it comes to RPGs, it's always about the story and this game my fellow gamers, has a good story. 
Betrayal, Loyalty, Saints and Sinners, Sex. It's all in here. Experiencing the different endings all give different vibes but they were all great endings. 

Combat in this game weren't too bad. I'd  give a 4 out of 5 because I've played shooters and slasher games. Shooting could be a little be smoother, but one can adapt to the mechanics. As for slashing with blades, I think they were fun, a bit over powered, but fun. Being stealthy was okay, made the game longer, but enjoyed taking my time in the game. Hacking was interesting, to the point where you can take down a whole area without even firing a single bullet. Play styles? Go loud with a shotgun, stealth your way with throwing knives, or hack your way through a stronghold. It's however you want to play. And when you finish, try the game again and play a different style.

Driving around Night City... yea you can drive around, then hit a wall, then a light pole, then into people, then into another car, and when you finally get it, you're finally driving straight. Until you have to turn again because you missed your exit. 

Graphics. obviously one of the biggest thing for gaming today. Gotta have the super computer if you wanna see the game's true potential. If you're not running at least an RTX card, then don't bother getting the game. This game was made for the next generation graphic cards and even the consoles. (Hint Hint, the console players couldn't even run the game) 

Overall, Yes I would recommend it. Just don't expect too much from watching all the trailers of the game. Just play, enjoy the scenes you come across and shoot who ever looks at you funny in the face. I hope they come up with some decent DLC's that expand the game, like different vehicles, weapons, or a unicorn... doubt though.

"
1609750080,"Bought this game because i loved Witcher 3, but now im staying away from whatever CD Projekt Red is releasing next."
1609749862,"I would recommend the game to others but after most of the nerve racking bugs get fixed and the flatline errors go away after doing everything from the CDprojektRed forums among others then maybe the game can be properly played again. Since i have hit the 150 hours plus of gameplay i have come to a screeching hault and can no longer doing anything while in game, i can log in but after a few seconds being in the game it tends to crashes back to the home screen. The game runs fine on my pc and has up until 150 hours. if anyone has any extra help it will gladly be obliged."
1609749126,shit crashes
1609749125,God story some bugs but nothing major for me.
1609749117,10x better on pc than console
1609749091,"This game, is pretty incredible. Yes, it is full of bugs, yes it has some strange choices for story. But all in all, pretty great game, easily enjoyable, and just doing all of the quests can net you a solid 100+ hours of gameplay. The game is by no means a masterpiece, but it is still one of the best games to come out in the past decade."
1609749069,Might not be the perfect game we all expected but it was an amazing experience.
1609749060,It's alright I guess. Only played it for a bit...
1609749051,it has its fair share of bugs and glitches but the story still holds strong and its quite an enjoyable game 97 percent of the time.
1609830075,"I would strongly recommend those who have yet purchased this game to wait for some major updates (and maybe even after the first expansion is announced), and a 25% discount. Cyberpunk 2077 in its current state is fine, enjoyable, but still semifinished.

Not what CDPR promised. But you prolly know this already.
As of early Jan. 2021, most game-breaking bugs seems have been eliminated. Remaining bugs can still be quite annoying, but they would leave you enough chance to feel the game.

Game itself is good, not a preem one like Red Dead Redemption 2, but it's good. 
Would give an 7/10.


Some major problems that annoy me:

Open world content is shittier than Elder Scrolls V or even Fallout 4. Not a single NPC has a life in Night City, and there is not much V can do in Night City except doing quests and gigs and bounty hunter jobs. 
Also V's reputation seems have been fixed on NEUTRAL for every single faction. My V has 50 street cred but was still treated like a petty nobody by everyone other than merchants, who reminds V their street cred by offering specific items.
Heck they didn't even try to provide some places for picturing the city centre landscape! Nor anyway to make a hair cut!

Items & stats system feels like shit. 
Johnny's items are all quest items so you cannot remove them from your inventory. Try to upgrade them to Epic/Legendary and you will find them eat up all your pathetic weight capacity, and you cannot even try to disassemble or sell them! But you can have a slippery hand and disassemble some other iconic items before you even know it!
Item crafting is okay, but upgrading feels shitty, boring and extremely unnecessary. Its sole purpose of existence is to make up for an even shittier skyrocketing stat system. Equipments you get in higher levels would simply outdone those you encounter early by 2~3 magnitude!"
1609748595,"I want to start by saying that while playing this game i had no crashes a few bugs (that i find funny and enjoy more than the game functioning properly).
But what upsets me about this game is that the game play is aggressively mediocre. It does nothing new or interesting just what other games have been doing for years.
The story is bland and not very interesting, they had Mike Pondsmith the creator of the cyberpunk role-playing game as a consultant. They should have stolen his adventures they are much more interesting. 
Each time Johnny Silverhand spoke to me i wish i could finish what Dexter started and kill V, I opted for what i was able to do and uninstalled instead."
1609748513,[spoiler] JACKIE NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO [/spoiler]
1609748490,"Regardless of the negative press this game has received, I love it."
1609748078,"I am writing this review after completing 100% of the achievements and a playtime over 100 hours. At first, I worried that Cyberpunk was going to be a game that suffered from rush development and under-cooking of the main ingredients. What I experienced was a game that was fun to play and a story-line that hooked me into it from the moment I could leave Watson. My best advice for anyone looking to buy or play this game, avoid places like Reddit and Twitter. Come up with your own opinion. It is what I did, and I love it."
1609747957,"The writing for this game is top notch!  If that's important to you, I would recommend picking this up.  No two side quests are the same (in terms of story) and they are sometimes connected, even the Gigs and NCPD stuff.  Street Cred actually does affect the interaction in some side quests.  
There are a tons of bugs right now, most minor, some annoying.  AI seems simple, The type of side gigs are limited rotation and the NCPD stuff is pretty much all the same in terms of gameplay."
1609747946,"I have never been more disappointed in a game before. Ignoring the bugs, the glitches, the mechanic issues... this plot of the game is simply boring. The conversations who are required to have are boring. By mid chapter 2, I was simply skipping through them all and would rather have killed every single person inside a place than have one more incredibly long, pointless, and BORING convo. Can't believe the same company that made Witcher made this steaming pile of waste."
1609747680,fun for about 3h-5h if your setup is decent. Pretty dull after that unfortunately
1609747650,"While I can't speak for the PS port or the Xbox, this game has been running pretty well on my laptop. Honestly, one of the best single player games I have played. The devs and artists have gone above and beyond with it and its really sad that the management have made such a mess. Great game, there's no doubt."
1609747604,"great game, didn't notice any crazy bugs like people say."
1609747525,"Guys the game isn't buggy, you're just constantly being hacked by an enemy Netrunner, it's meant to be immersive duh.

"
1609747393,"its dope, didnt really see any glitches"
1609747048,"This generation's Daikatana.  Gameplay so far has been 'meh' at best, controls are a mess, graphics are not all that great (running maxed on a 2080) - definitely not the 'best' at anything, audio is terrible (music and overall playback).  

This game reminds me heavily of Daikatana's over hyped mess along with the Vampire Bloodlines releases.  Both were just sloppy and it shows in this game as well.

Game is in definite need of bug fixes, lots of popups, crackling audio, etc.  

Character development so far is subpar (not sure why I should care about any of these people).  Also, digging through trashcans to sell junk to vendors gets old.

This game just doesn't seem to hold my attention like I was hoping it would story wise.  I typically love single player games like Fallout, Skyrim, Farcry, etc.  Story and atmosphere reel me in, and this game - other than being set in a quasi-futuristic city, just seems like any other place we've already played to death in other games.

At this time, I just can't recommend this game at full price and in it's current condition."
1609746882,"aside from some glitches i recommend it because first of all the story is incredibly in depth and the game is gorgeous whether its being played on ""Ultra"" or ""High."" if your computer can handle skyrim, your computer would be very happy to run cyberpunk."
1609746824,Its a great game but once you see what was promised compared to what we got it really isn't worth it at the moment and this goes directly to the execs - go **** yourselves.
1609746733,Not bad.
1609746595,Wait until they decide to fix the game in a couple of years
1609746487,"Finally, GTA 6."
1609746480,Fun and interesting
1609746480,shitty game
1609848255,"Geat game, but Witcher 4 was a better ideia"
1609746278,The whole kit and kaboodle
1609745885,yes
1609745832,"fart
"
1609745819,It's an adequate cyberpunk-themed game
1609745731,I wanted to wait for this game until I got my hands on a 30 series card as my 1080 would have a hard time pushing pixels at any setting beyond medium @1440p.  Turns out that I couldn't wait.  No glitches at the 5 hour mark.  Great game so far. It looks good @ medium but 40 fps hurts.
1609745571,i berry much enjoyed
1609745298,It's pretty ok. Good even. Big fun for a big man
1609745238,"It was a great immersive experience right up until the end, it fails where Red Dead Redemption succeeds 7.5/10"
1609745157,"Look, this game is buggy and horribly optimized, but if you are actually able to play it the game is absolutley amazing. There are balancing issues and the such that comes with any new release but i don't regret buying the game. The story is to die for and I've only ever encontered one actual game breaking bug in all the time I've played and that was fixed by reloading the checkpoint. If you can't run the game now or don't want to buy it outright, wait a couple months for them to fix bugs and improve the game and I think it would be worth buying without a doubt."
1609744995,"although there are bugs in game but the story,the music... are so good"
1609744937,awesome game love it
1609744923,"Fantastic game! A bit shorter than expected, but I think it's good to be left wanting more, than not liking and stop playing. I'm having almost no bugs at all, after updating Nvidia drivers."
1609744930,"I want to preface that I preordered this game June 2019 after the presentation by CDProject and Keanu Reeves at E3.

I love this game. Even with the glitches.

Pros:
Fun, exciting, action packed story with multiple paths and endings.
Custom character creation, character builds, etc;
Clothing is nice, fun to find and all different
Graphics, although laggy at times, are nice.

Neither pro nor con:
Combat is easy once you get the hang of it, and you do reach a point where things arent difficult anymore. (at least, on normal mode)
Customization is limited to your character, all cars you find in game are set like that indefinitely, really wish we could at least customize V's car or something
Mods for clothing and guns are unclear, leading to many of us (myself included) stacking things that don't even actually stack. unclear if this is a glitch or not.

Cons:
Glitches. I haven't experienced any that are game breaking, mostly theyre funny.
A lot of promised features just arent here.
Braindances. where are they? why can we buy braindances from people but not use them?
Very laggy at times.
The car physics. Why? Just WHY? You go to turn and end up in a ditch. Pls fix."
1609744849,"I haven't experienced anything game breaking, but sometimes the bugs make the game better in their own way

Other than the bugs, the storyline and details are REALLY REALLY good, probably one of my favourites out of all the games I've played

And last but not least, CDPR, I'm still waiting on them DLC's"
1609744847,What a wonderful dumpster fire
1609744603,haha quickhacking go brrrrrrt
1609744576,terrible bugs
1609744570,"This game is a bug. And if it wasn't we would all notice that the open world is boring, combat is boring, the npcs AI systems belong in a museum and 98% of the choices in the game are meaningless. This game has no idea what it wants to be. True RPG - naaaah BUT we will include character customization. Story driven - yeah sorta WHEN the quests don't glich out. Looter Shooter - Bingo! And we hope you like looter shooter because you will be swapping to a weapon with better stats every three seconds. But a lot of the cheesy rushed aspects of the game could be forgiven if everything wasn't a gosh darnit bug. I can't count the amount of times a quest wouldn't progress because something didn't load or an npc decided to have Biblical knowledge with the world map. Don't buy into the hype. Don't listen to the fan boys who will tell you that gliches only happen on low end pcs. I am running with i9 9900k CPU, a Geforce RTX 2070 Super and 32GB of RAM at 3600 Mhz. This game was so glichy I gave up playing. Real shame. I wanted to love this so bad. Go buy something else. They will probably finish this game by next year."
1609744360,"BIG PP
"
1609744052,"Buggy, but all in all I think this is a great game.  Hope they fix up all the bugs soon.  Looking forward to the DLC!!"
1609744030,Its good enough to be recommended. Just don't listen to the console peasants and if you got a medium core pc go for it.
1609743964,"This game is just plain fun. I have played over 40 hours so far and beyond an early bug where I couldn't finish a main story line quest, it has been very smooth playing and very well done."
1609743851,"Great story, great map great graphics, good gameplay. Looking forward to if they do any DLC's ect."
1609840734,"At the current state of the game, I would definitely wait for a sale of some sort.

The idea and imagination of the dark, cruel underworld that Cyberpunk 2077 and CD Projekt Red promised was not well executed - IF at all... To say the least, for a game released in 2020 and to have been marketed at such a high level, the faults and flaws of Night City are really embarrassing.

Usually I would play an RPG game until all the side quests are done, all the legendary weapons are collected, etc., but I just find no motivation or will to do any of that within Night City. The story is rich, the environment is promising, and there's that little touch of ""what could be""... But, in the end, it fell short.

The GAMEPLAY is unique, but it's not punctual; I've tried going through enemies with a katana, gunning down dudes with a revolver, and using nothing but quick hacks. All of it is a breath of fresh, futuristic combat but it's hard to follow through with it because there aren't other solid play styles like a smooth stealth system.

The STORY is interesting, but unappealing. There's nothing that draws me towards the main quest. With the Witcher III, CD Projekt Red paved the way to Vizima by showing you the sudden appearance of Yennefer and the desperate surroundings of the situation with the impending threat of the Wild Hunt and desperate search for Ciri. In Cyberpunk, you don't get to experience grooming growth in characters, the story, or side quests. You lose a best friend that you barely had any knowledge of, you get a thing stuck in your brain, and now suddenly you have Keanu Reaves and you're dying. All explained in the matter of 30 minutes with quick flashbacks and sudden swings.

The BUGS are bad, but I haven't run into any game breaking bugs. If you complain about minor t-pose bugs, you're expecting too much. It's impossible to release a game without bugs... Unless you're Rockstar

I'll play a game multiple times until I completely tore through every bit of the world, but I can't say that I would replay Cyberpunk as a Nomad, Corpo, AND Street Kid

Definitely wait for a sale and a lot of patches until this game even becomes considerable for purchase; CDPR have A LOT to do."

Gameplay: The gameplay in Cyberpunk is fun and allows for a good experience but it isn't anything groundbreaking. You will have a good time playing it but don't expect innovations in gaming.

Graphics: Cyberpunks aesthetic is amazing and truly fits the cyberpunk vibe. I didn't rate this masterpiece though due to the graphical glitches the game currently has. I'll be playing the game and notice that in bright light textures seems to have a ""TV static"" kinda effect on them and it just looks off.

Audio: The scores of Cyberpunk are amazing and catchy. They are all custom made and they enlisted multiple artists to help create the songs. I'm especially fond of the songs by ""Samurai"" and have added them to my Spotify. 

Audience: This game has a lot of sexual content and isn't really made for kids.

Story: I really love the story in Cyberpunk and get attached to the characters (except for you Placide). The game has multiple endings, including a secret one.

Difficulty: The game has your standard difficulty modes but, as you get used to the gameplay you'll quickly adapt the such changes. Your combat is pretty standard and feels similar to that of Borderlands or Fallout 4.

Grind: You can go through the whole story without worrying about the enemies. If you want to complete certain sidequests or get certain perks though you will need to do a little bit of grinding (although the random encounters and quests are quite enjoyable)

Game Time: The pace at which you play the game depends on you. You could beat the main story in 30 hours at  a normalish pace or you can spend hundreds doing every little side quest and exploring Night City.

Price: I put this as wait for sale because at the current state the game isn't finished and was put on the market to early. If you are very interested in this game and have no problem waiting for them to slowly fix the game up, then by all means go ahead and buy the game you will enjoy it. If you are still unsure I'd suggest waiting some months until it is patched up a bit more and in a more finished state."
1609742992,Still some bugs but a really fun game.
1609742867,"I've had the pleasure of having the only bug I've run into being a pair of floating chopsticks in one of the cutscenes.  I'm running with a Ryzen 5 2600 and RX 570 and I'm getting a comfortable roughly 40 fps on average with a mix of settings, mostly medium and high with shadows turned to Low.  I recommend following Santiago Santiago's benchmark on YouTube and then making finer adjustments to the graphics yourself.  I haven't finished the main story, but I'm really enjoying my time so far."
1609742839,Besides the bugs its a good story driven game. I loved it.
1609742824,"Game's good, despite the glitches"
1609742797,"Although the game has some bugs that are not fully game breaking, I would highly suggest giving the game a shot. In my experience so far, the game has been an interesting story with easy to know game mechanics, fps has some minor problems, but with some messing around with the settings, things were pretty good. In conclusion, Cyberpunk is a game that has loads of fun to be had minus the little bugs. I highly recommend this game if you have the right computer specs"
1609742768,cyberpun k  :)
1609742670,"Game is super immersive, sucks you right in. There are tons of interesting characters to meet and so many sidequests."
1609742653,most of the glitches seem to be removed so play it
1609742646,"great
"
1609742330,"I accidentally picked angel and got fucked in the ass, I also got fucked in the ass by the corpo chick. I don't even know if my character is straight anymore, well I guess what happens in Night City stays in Night City."
1609742074,"Just hit the 200 hour mark on this game and feel as though I've seen enough to give a decently accurate review.

Pros:
The atmosphere and world-building of the game is amazing. There are missions with really interesting stories and some even tie in with each other. It truly feels like you got placed into a living community, where no one cares if you're the protagonist, donning nothing but a pair of briefs and a light machine gun that's clearly overcompensating for something. 

Driving feels nice and comfortable (when the game decides not to clip V into a wall, another car, or --God Forbid--the ground into the endless void where your only option is to reload a save). Drifting has never been so intuitive to me before, but I'm not much of a racing gamer so take that with a grain of salt.

Varying play styles are such a great feature with the skills you can learn and different perks. I've been playing through 4 separate characters with different ability focuses and it's been a real immersive experience. On a side note, crafting (technical) is the best branch since you can just craft epic/legendary and disassemble/sell them for those gains.

Cons:
Oversights like explosions not interacting with water are a real problem. Grenades don't blow up gas stations, but two stray bullets will. V doesn't automatically get forced off his motorcycle when he drives into water, taking the ""Everything is fine"" approach to life.

Bugs are rampant. Good news is that its probably going to be fixed. Bad news: THERE ARE BUGS! Sometimes, missions can't be completed or I'm soft-locked in an elevator shaft with the cops wondering where I went. My car decides to Dragon Ball Z fuse with a nearby solar panel. I try to climb through a window and shoots me across the desert as if I had the Black Plague where I promptly laughed, blew myself up with a grenade, and quit for the day. I spawn inside of a character. A character doesn't spawn. I get pushed off the roof off a building because the cold wind slapped my buttocks. I take fall damage TWICE on occasion but the second hit comes later, where I may be running from gunmen and my character decides to spontaneously trip and die.

Overall: 7/10 

Love the game, just fix it up a bit... please.
"
1609741937,"save early and often, because there will be bugs. other than that, it is one of the most in depth story driven games i've ever played. everything is dubbed, the storylines are all great, and there are lots of them, and the general gameplay is just a lot of fun. 

I am really hoping the studio continues to invest time and energy into this game to hammer out all the small details and fix the bugs. if they do, I am pretty sure this will be the next ""skyrim"" when it comes to re-playability."
1609741918,"Sci-fi skyrim with better story, characters, gameplay, missions, and graphics. About the same amount of bugs but hey, that didn't stop skyrim."
1609741872,"new gta, very good"
1609741847,fun
1609741750,it's pretty good
1609741480,Apart from the bugs here and there the game is great.
1609741383, The Cyberpunk World is well laid out and planned well. The only issues are (1) The crashes of the game (two) The lack of crafting your own home(the decor. etc.) (3) Different stories (maybe as DLCs ? Just a thought).
1609741310,"I've enjoyed the game more than most.  It's got it's fair share of launch problems but none of them stopped me from having a good time.  The game has a great story and a solid cast.  Gameplay options are pretty solid.  There are 5 attributes that level up as you use them and they have 12 skill tree's with over 200 skills you can pick from.  The game has solid role playing options that effect the story.  The game has 3 starting paths and 5 endings with well over 100 hours of quality content.  The soundtrack is also very solid and the graphics are a cut above anything I've seen before.  Probably the best example of open world building in a game at this point in time.

Despite how fun the game is I can tell that it was rushed out for the holiday season and there are some areas that still need further polishing.  The AI that governs the traffic is not finished and often causes cars to just stop and all traffic will come to a standstill.  Traffic will not try to drive around stopped cars that are not responding and in some spots on the map you can see cars spawn into view.  Combat AI isn't bad but it's ability to detect a threat needs to be tweaked.  Lots of visual bugs that need polishing."

1609740425,hecken good
1609740344,"Honestly a great game now that they got most of the worst bugs figured out. Game is graphically on the next level especially with ray-tracing, but is also very demanding even on an RTX 3080. You're experience with the game differs greatly based on how you choose to progress through the game. I am really looking forward to the updates coming to the game over the course of 2021 and I highly recommend this game even in its current state. Just don't blame the developers for the mistakes of higher ups pressured by corporate greed (which is kind of ironic based on the games depiction of corpos)"
1609740332,Good game with story that will keep you interested. Looking forward to more fixes and DLCs.
1609740140,"Incredible level of detail and decent fight mechanics. Would love for dialog options to play a bitter role in the story, it's possible that I'm not far enough for that."
1609740134,Haven't had the so-called glitches everyone is talking about. The game itself is great and I would recommend it to anyone!
1609739895,"A bug ridden, lukewarm RPG experience carried to greatness by the story, characters and the sprawling backdrop of Night City."
1609739778,They promised an RPG Grand Theft Auto in the year 2077 but they delivered a reskin of 2013's Watchdogs only with more bugs.
1609739699,"Great game, very in-depth"
1609739654,almost 50 hours in and I feel like I could very easily pull another 200 once I get the free time. Definitely worth the pre-order glitches bugs and all. if anything the bugs i've experienced have all enhanced the game.
1609739590,Game is a blast. Just a good time.
1609739578,"Game was good despite the bugs, don't get me wrong here...Just wished the damn endings weren't so grim...it felt like a massive ""cliff hanger"". But that's where you bring in your imagination I guess. I hope they release future DLC's with this game, and can make up for the games release being so rushed."
1609739535,"Yes, there are bugs. Yes, the game could run better. Despite those things, this is one of the most immersive, interesting, fun to play, ""Worth $60"" games I've played in years, and I'd recommend it to anyone who has the hardware to run it, and enjoys a true open-world RPG."
1609739505,"The game is great, i have not 100% yet, but have done mostly all.  I will come back to it, and do another replay of it when more dlc is released, cant wait.  I recommend it for sure, but i also feel that with more patches and dlc, it will be even better."
1609739341,"There has been a lot of hyberbole flying around related to this game, positive and negative, both before and after launch. 

Stepping outside all that, as a big fan of all 3 Witcher games, I was pretty satisfied with what I got here. The strengths (characters, story and world) are all pretty much in line with what I loved about previous games from the studio. The story and characters are strong, and Night City is among the most impressivly detailed urban open worlds in gaming. 

The gameplay side of things is good enough to be enjoyable, though certainly outclassed by other games. There are good options for playstyles that provide more variety in character builds than the Witcher games. The biggest drawbacks are the well documented technical issues, with inconsistent and buggy enemy AI being the worst offender. 

I was fairly fortunate in my playthrough with bugs, encountering only minor issues, at worst having to reload a save on a couple of occasions. However, minor glitches and some rather broken systems like the cops still break immersion with some regularity. 

Between the bugs and performance issues, waiting a few months for patches is likely a good idea, but if you've enjoyed CD Projekts previous work, Cyberpunk 2077 is well worth playing."
1609739320,"This is a good game. 
Engaging story and solid world building."
1609739301,"Disclaimer : the game is still buggy at this point after a few patches when I wrote this review on this date the 3rd of January 2021

Buggy!

Yes it is , for a game being developed or made for 8 , 9 maybe 10 years or more... yes it is buggy

despite the bugs and a few patches , the Game is over all great , I spent 134 hours Finishing the Side Missions , Gigs , some of the Main Mission and Crafting and Upgrading Weapons and Armor , collecting all car some of them

Game Play...It reminds me of a few games

DeusEx is one of em probably the futuristic side of the game using cybernetics implants to your character and the game overall

Fall Out 3 , Yes Fall Out 3 due the small side missions and random hidden quests , Collecting weapon , armor and garbage for bartering and money

Watch Dogs where you can Hack enemies to stop them  , Machines to steal money or Use them distract enemies , make Turrets your friend , peek over camera's view

Grand Theft Auto / Red Dead Redemption 2 , Why? the Map is Huge given you are travelling using cars or motorcycle , or simply using fast traveling the Map is Huge , the Alleys , back buildings , unopened doors that you can hack or forced to open , broken fences that you can break in , opened windows where you can jump in for more stealthy move

Overall CD Projeckt Red , did an Amazing job ( spoiler Alert ) there are hidden gems in this game on some side quests

If you play this game and finish just the main quest and side quest , you will find it boring and probably give it a bad rating , the game is build to be explored , there are lots of possibilities that could happened when you choose the wrong decisions on each Quest
"
1609739076,"Amazing game, haven't run into any problems. Great story"
1609738847,The person who reviewed this bad on my friends list is wrong and should feel bad
1609738771,nah
1609738737,no
1609738711,"There is some negative chatter about this game but I love it and haven't seen glitches etc that some talk of. As far as the story goes, if you came into this expecting it to be better than every other game ever coded then I guess you might be disappointed, but then perhaps I wasn't expecting it to be so I am not. Hell, I can remember paying 20c for a game of space invaders on an arcade machine so this game is pretty damn amazing in my mind!"
1609738647,"I enjoyed it. I was put off from hearing it's a buggy mess, unoptimized and unplayable. It is each of those at points, but not all the time. A good amount of the bugs are either hilarious, fixed with quicksave/load, or kinda negligable. Moving too fast can cause texture loading issues, but they tended to load pretty quickly.

Overall, good game, don't regret buying on PC."
1609739127,"I do recommend this, but there's a huge asterisk on this recommendation.

First of all, if you're looking for something to scratch that GTA itch, you won't find it here. The open world here is like Witcher 3... A lot of AI doing mostly nothing. There are some scripted events here and there, but not to the same degree as let's say GTA 5, or something like Elder Scroll's Radiant AI. *BUT* not all open-world games need to be sandbox a la GTA, but I do agree that there needs to be some semblance of life within the thousands of NPC you're gonna be looking at for the next 50 hours you'll spend playing this game. So treat the gorgeous open-world/city as a glorified loading screen.

Gameplay is serviceable. It feels like a much faster and easier form of Deus Ex combat. You have multiple approach to any situation, and most quests/encounters can be dealt easily(or otherwise) depending on how you build your V. Gunplay feels satisfying, but the RPG mechanics(if you would call it that) would feel lacking to any veteran RPG players(those who play CRPGs). The controls is okay for the most part. Vehicle handling is god-awful, but both of these can be remedied with the mods that's floating in the internet.

Graphics and performance: My setup is a R5 3600, RTX 3070 and 16GB of RAM, and the game is installed on a SATA SSD.
The game loads so fast from the menu(especially with the intro skip mod). That's pretty commendable imo.
Graphics are top-notch in the city, even without RTX. RTX is just a cherry-on-top kinda thing and is debatable whether the RTX is worth the FPS drops or not. But there are areas in the game where it felt like they were rushed, specifically Pacifica and the Badlands. You can see areas where the textures are subpar compared to the city, and actually floating garbage in the badlands/garbage areas. Also the pop-in issue is *REALLY* noticeable when driving.
As for the performance, it seems to be a hit and miss on my setup, especially before the 1.05 patch(SMT was turned off for AMD for some reason before 1.05). This game is mostly GPU-bound on most scenarios, but I can already feel that the 3600 is not up-to-snuff on some scenarios. Maybe there's just something wrong with my setup, I dunno.
Some of the settings doesn't actually change much and just eats up FPS for some reason(like Color Grading) so a mix and match of settings is recommended(I used Digital Foundry's settings, but mileage may vary.)

Sound and Music: Sound design is pretty good for the most part, though, there are points in the game where there are audio missing, or went missing as the game went on(like punches and explosion). But as I said, the quality is pretty good, and the dynamic range is pretty wide.
Music for the most part is subjective. The main theme, the story theme, some combat music are some that I liked, but the combat music kinda feels like it copied Doom 2016's soundtrack. But overall, they're pretty good and actually has variance into it.

Story: This is the meat of the game. The narrative for 95% of the game is pretty good, tho kinda hamfisted. But the major characters acted and played their part really well and presented everything properly.
The lifepaths you choose at the beginning doesn't affect very much into the story, so the main quest is pretty linear for the most part, but there are choices that will affect the ending you can get. So Witcher kinda stuff.
Linearity isn't inherently bad imo, just as long as the execution is good, and I think they nailed it here.

TL;DR: If you're expecting GTA V but futuristic, move along. This game is not for you.
But if you want some more open world RPGs that's like Bethesda's, then I can safely recommend this to you, with better story and acting to boot. Also, if you want to benchmark your PC, especially RTX, get this game."
1609738518,"Despite bugs, it shows the potential of AAA Openworld Roleplaying. Although it unfortunately only contains the bare minimum to be called one itself."
1609738415,"This game is slow on loading at times, extremely buggy, and just and all round mess.

but its fun

Like i had so much fun, it's unironically my personal game of the year

If you like first person shooters and rpgs I'd highly recommend it. you'd love the game... when it works... and thats the important part, I personally find it easy to ignore bugs, its no big nuisance to me, so i appreciate the good more than im bothered by the bad and thats important for my game of the year experience,

so if you think your game would be ruined by the bugs maybe wait for some fixes, but definitely pick it up at some point"

"
1609738201,"This is a really enjoyable game, and an even better experience.  Games like this rarely come along.  Its got a few issues but what game doesn't?  10 out a 10, quit reading this and buy it already!"
1609738514,"*NO SPOILERS*
I'm going to keep this short and sweet and mostly personal but you'll get the idea.

[b]Main story[/b] is interesting, but not that fulfilling or good in the end no matter which choices you make. It falls short because it's only interesting, that's the thing. But that in no way means it's good. It's really missing a lot after you reach the climax. Once you arrive at the end, you're STILL interested and curious because the story never ended. You're left with what you've got. The meal is done. It's all over but you're still hungry. That's how it feels regardless of which paths you choose.

Welcome to the [b]World[/b] of Cyberpunk 2077. It's absolutely [i]gorgeous[/i] and at times you might find yourself just walking around the city at night admiring the skyscrapers that tower before you. Even when you're in an absolute dump of an area that you might even hate in real life, you can't help but to appreciate the detailed exterior and interior designs. Throughout the story, all scenes are done first person point of view and it's truly immersive; however, the world of Cyberpunk is not. What I mean is, Cyberpunk fails to immerse you in it's world of fantasies. Imagine going to Vegas and not being able to do anything. Well, except for the fact that you can drive around and shoot people in the head. That might sound fun to some people in real life (hopefully not), but imagine that's how it is. Even then, shooting people in the head could get boring, right? From all the money I've obtained from doing so, where should I spend it in ""Vegas""? After all, we [i]are[/i] in [b]SIN[/b] city. I SHOULD be able to enjoy myself after all that hard work and IMMERSE myself in the glorious pleasures that are so well advertised all around the city.... but I can't. We were lead to believe that Cyberpunk 2077 would be setting the bar for other games. We were lead to believe that we could be so immersed we'd be gasping for air in the real world (maybe not so much but you know what I mean). Anyways, there are PLENTY of beautiful games out there that are more immersive in my opinion. I can't help to feel like this game is just another modified version of Fallout with a different setting.

This review is really difficult for some reason. I could really break it down, but I mean, the game isn't the best. It's not.
Combat isn't the best either, and you begin to wonder why you kill who you kill and why you spare the people you spare.

7/10 - Mid-tier game at best.

This game was disappointing in a lot of areas and honestly it won't be on the same level as the Witcher 3. 
I only recommend it if you don't have your hopes very high and are into a some Fallout type-""ish""? gameplay with a very beautiful world around you that... well, that you can't interact with much. Side quests are honestly more interesting than the main story. I'm ending it here for now to give a quick review for those who do read mine.

Game is not worth the 60 dollars though.

Message me if you want more details about the game."
1609737994,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time playing this game.
I have steered clear of any social media regarding the game and just played it how I would play any game. It was such an enjoyable experience with much more for me to go and finish.
recommended"
1609737951,i like it despite the bugs
1609737728,"Really fucking good game, with all the bugs present at the moment of this review this game is still 8.5/10, once taxi missions get fixed and some minor polishes roll out this game could be even 10/10. It has great story even though main story line is quite short. I've finished the game in 102 Hours of playing (save file time, steam reports that i played it for 168) and I can tell you money and time well spent. Few things to nit pick, some of the dialogues gave me mixed feelings as i completed all of the side quests and then started playing main quest it seemed that i was great friend with Johnny by the time i started playing story but during story dialogues V was acting cold or hostile against Johnny, In case anybody from CD projekt red is reading this, this could use some work."
1609737653,"Great game and story. Ran fine on PC despite a few small glitches.
One annoyance (and spoiler alert): there is a secret quest (Don't Fear the Reaper) at the end that requires some pretty specific dialogue options during the prior Johnny quests. It required me to backtrack and lose a lot of my leveling progress and items to access the hardest quest in the game. I barely survived it. Just a tip to check on youtube for how to best navigate the dialogue options."
1609737615,"The game is good. I find myself coming home after work and turning this game on every night nearly a month later. The environment is wonderful. The city itself as well as the music give the game an incredible ambiance. I just stood there in front of a screen in-game and watched the advertisements. You can get so completely absorbed into your surroundings and feel like you're in a completely different world.

That is until the NPC next to you starts T-Posing.

It has bugs, it has glitches, there's things missing that I wish were in the game but it's overall still a very fun and enjoyable experience. But I have 1,000's of hours into bethsoft games so I may not care about bugs as much as the next person. 

7.5/10"
1609737602,"Don't buy it as is, wait for them to fix it and properly port the game to PC.  It works on a few PCs at an acceptable level, everyone else experiences some game breaking bug or another.  I for one had multiple.

One of them had an audio bug that had crackling included in all audio (music, characters, sound fx, etc.) and could only be fixed by restarting the game.  Ruined immersion immediately and god forbid it hit during a long story sequence.  Either play out the entire sequence/cutscene with terrible audio OR replay the large portion you already saw.  Lose-Lose.

Another was in the final mission (no spoilers), there were multiple points where if I looked at a certain texture head-on, my entire game would instantly crash.  Not acceptable, but easy enough work around right?  Nope.  It was a necessary room that I had to pass through on my 5th attempt by staring at my feet and hugging a wall.  I failed this strategy on my 4th attempt because I got stuck on a wall and had to look around to figure out where to go.  If this were anything other than the final mission I would have quit playing right then and there.  There were plenty more, but I'll leave them to you to experience from videos posted online as I had just about all of them that I've seen.

If Steam offered refunds like Sony did, I would instantly request one.  The entire universe was amazing to experience, but it felt severely incomplete.  I finished the game partially due to the world building and partially due to the sunken cost fallacy.  Maybe this will pull a No Man's Sky and become a good RPG at some point, but currently it's a half-baked fallout set in a Cyberpunk world."

1609737462,Game is Buggy AF but its cool. Great Game
1609737457,"I am in love with the game so far, but I do also have a 30 series"
1609737375,At first i dint like this game but then after a few patchs and me doing an exp glitch so the enimes were bullet sponges i started to enjoy it the chracters are very likeable and hatable and the story and side missions are pretty good
1609737199,grear game 10/10
1609737061,"Is it perfect? No.
Do i love it anyway? Yes
Its beautiful, the story is fantastic, and I really love the world."
1609736839,this game it's awesome but i hate where polis spawn to me so i hop there fix it later
1609736623,p
1609736543,"Got about 30 hours on PC and another 20 on Xbox.  So far I'm enjoying it, the patches that were released have fixed all game ending crashes that I was aware of. Game-play is excellent and the storyline is great so far."
1609736534,"Graphics amazing, storyline 10/10, however, bugs were annoying but you could dismiss them but would take you out the immersion. Also, the police AI or enemy npcs are hot garbage. I played on the hardest difficulty and even though there were struggles, it felt as if they enemy was braindead. 

But overall, putting the negatives aside I loved this game. The story telling and dialogue was the best. This game definitely has wasted potential such as the use of abilities could've have a bigger impact, but other than that I'll give the game 8.5/10"
1609736454,"Being a big fan of cdpr and the witcher series; With a heavy heart, I cannot recommend this game in the state that it is in. This game is very unpolished, empty, and horribly optimized.

 This game does a few things right. It looks fantastic, the city design is incredible, and it has a handful of good quests. The skill progression is heading in the right direction but it caps waay too soon and most of the skills you get are very slight and not much of an impact. 

It has many many things wrong with it. I could write a book of all the missing features and bugs that the game has. There is almost nothing realistic to do in night city besides the main quest and side missions. Theres a million police side gigs that are very repetitive and not unique or interesting at all. The city is not interactive at all. Npc's do not have real lives, npc driving is a disgrace and they behave retarded, not reacting to your presence in the slightest. Cops are retarded too, they spawn directly behind you no matter where you are and if you run 50ft away then they forget about you. Old games from the early 2000's like driver or gta 3 have better cops then cyberpunk. Its downright embarrasing.

 Customization is almost none existent too. There are a lot of cool cars to buy but ZERO customization. Can't even change the paint job. Housing is very dry too, You start with a basic apartment and later on you will gain a few more ""rooms"" to sleep in but thats it. No customization, no mansions, nothing. 

The story is decent but feels very rushed, especially the prologue. Feels like 15-20 hours of content was cut out and your thrown into the mix of this plot that your barely familiar with. Theres no build up to the story. Like I mentioned theres a small handful of really good missions that I had a great time playing. I completed the story and all side missions even the hidden ones and it was no where near enough content to satisfy me. 

Combat is pretty basic and could use more diversity and tweaking. Netrunning is cool but could be more fleshed out, it is not even close to the kind of netrunning they teased in the demo. Crafting and upgrading feels very broken and is not worth your time at all.

I could talk about so much more but these are the things that disappoint me the most. Especially how empty night city is, hundreds of locked doors that you don't have access to. You can't play the arcade games you see everywhere. You can't call up your favorite character and go hang out at a bar or restaurant because outside of quests you are nonexistent to them. Theres advertisements everywhere about vr games and videos and of course you can't try any of them only the few story related ones which are very linear.

Also like I mentioned this game runs HORRIBLY. So many bugs in every aspect and so many things that don't work as they should. And the optimization is disgusting as well. My rig was supposed to run this game at medium to high settings and boy is that a lie. I struggle to run the game on low. Framerate dips everywhere you go its like the game is barely holding on, barely even at a running state. It is no where near ready to be released. 

This is the gist of my review, I'm so disappointed in this game right now. Cdpr has let us down so badly. They lied about so much. This game is nothing like it was advertised. Many rpgs that are 5-10 years old are better than this game. 

If your on the fence about buying/playing this game then here in my advice: wait 2-3 years. Yes literally 2-3 years no joke and buy the deluxe edition on sale with all the future dlc and maybe by that time the game will actually run and have enough content to redeem itself."
1609736445,Despite all the bad publicity this game has racked up I think it lives up to expectations originally set. The bugs seem very few and far between and have not ruined any aspect of game play for me. The story is amazing and the world is very immersive. PLEASE JUST BUY THE GAME AND DON'T FEED INTO ALL THE MEDIA HYPE. CD Projekt Red has released another fantastic game and it is absolutely worth your money and time. You won't regret it!
1609736380,"i have finished this game by focusing on main missions, and after that you may not open your saved game to play with side missions. the navigation is sucks, sometimes it leads you in the same spot where there's nothing to do there, the physics sucks, killing people with sniper rifle has bug, though you hit it with your weapon they wont die"
1609736229,pretty good
1609736049,Cyberpunk is a premium experience with neon lights and stylistic designs.
1609735987,"Bugs?  Plenty.  AI inept?  Definitely.  However there is something about it that keeps dragging me in.  I keep saying that I'll wait a few months when more patches have come through - I have uninstalled it a couple of times now with that intention in mind, but... I keep having that urge to play.  I like it, what can I say.  I definitely have a long wish list of things I'd like CDPR to fix, but, there's clearly enough working to pull me back in."
1609735922,"It is just barely satisfying enough with gameplay alone

However i wouldnt recommend if i was going on accuracy of all the trailers.

Mostly disappointed from this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LlAgvWD948&ab_channel=IGN im all for vehicle customization...
However it was supposed to be with game launch, heres hoping it was only delayed to be a later content and not scrapped entirely"
1609735912,not sure if i am just a lucky one but i find this game to be fantastic. i am about 30 hours in and enjoying every minute. yes there are some bugs but for me no more bugs than when i was playing skyrim. Highly recommended. Sad to see all of the hate for this game

1609778274,"- Let's be honest, it's good
- A truly next gen game

Not quite a masterpiece because of the bugs and missing gameplay features; in particular human AI and realistic physics"
1609735721,"Despite running the game on the latest hardware available, still subject to incredibly frequent crashes and performance issues. Save yourself the headache, don't buy it."
1609735655,"OK, here goes. I know there is a big divide on this game and it's ratings. Even for the PC version, there are some bugs, but there is nothing that is unforgiving. So far (played 15 hours at the time of this writing) I have to say the game is rich with things to do, and though I feel a bit lost with the RPG system, it does progress the player and motivates to find better stuff. The game itself is very beautiful, and looks great on my mid-rig. I have to recommend, even with the bad press it is still a AAA game, and a good one at that."
1609735550,"Interesting story, but full of bugs and game crashes."
1609735531,"some visual glitches and a couple hard crashes, but the game is pretty solid otherwise. a lot of quality content."
1609735421,An on-rails shooter set in an empty city.
1609735352,"Lets just get this out of the way: yes its buggy. Visual bugs are the big one, occasionally I've had some others like my motorcycle wont go forward or some other similar issue; nothing a little quicksave and then load can't fix. But the real question is, did I have fun?

Yes, yes I did.

The story is decent enough, not as memorable as Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines, but no where near as bad as Bioshock Infinite. Overall, It aint much to write home about but you won't hate it. The characters are all unique, and well voice acted. Night city looks fantastic, and feels like a living world; a couple steps above GTA V.

On to mechanics. Shooting feels great, enemies are challenging enough, but the one caveat is melee. Good God in Heaven is Melee fucking broken. And I don't mean broken like a glass plate dropped onto a concrete floor, I mean stupid overpowered. You invest enough into it, you'll reach a point where an enemy threatens you with death, so you whip out your Katana, anime blade run at him, then summarily kill him in one, maybe two hits. Hell I beat one of the final bosses in less than two minutes using melee. Still great fun tho, don't get me wrong, just be warned of what you'll be capable of.

So yeah, its a bit of a buggy mess. But it's fun on PC, so that's why I give it a thumbs up."
1609735292,best rpg of all time. pre-ordered it over a year ago  and it was worth the wait WOOOOO
1609735189,"A bit buggy, and requires a midrange system to be barely able to enjoy it. (1080 ti caps at 70-80 frames on lowest settings) The story and the Night City experience sucks you right in, however the combat and enemy ai, as well as the different build scaling in this game makes it a bit of a cake walk. It's a bit weird when V would have dialogue about certain fights being hard or near death experiences when in reality it was just a complete cake walk that ended in a few seconds. But I think everything can be chalked up to player choice, and as the player you have a lot of agency about your experience with in Night City"
1609735052,"I like this game, but I wouldn't recommend it.  I was excited for the game to come out, but was never ""hyped"" about it.  I didn't know about all the promises the game had made on what the content would be - It just looked like a good game and I loved The Witcher.  I completed the main story line at about 51 hours and have about 30% of the side quests left.   I started on normal difficulty, but moved to hard, then very hard in the mid 30's.  I still one shot everything and nothing was really challenging after certain upgrades.  For what it's worth, I had only 2 bugs the entire play through and it ran smooth otherwise.  Having owned the game for a few weeks now I've looked into it a bit and if I had known what they were promising the game was verse what they delivered it would be a colossal disappointment.    

I would recommend this at around 30 dollars with the expectation that it's The Witcher 3 on easy mode set in the future."
1609734952,"Not CDPR's Finest Work

...But it'll do. 

I thoroughly enjoyed this game from start to finish. Despite all the controversy surrounding it, I do love this game. The story is very strong and the characters really carry weight across their respective story lines.

Having completed everything this game has to offer, I can confidently give my full thoughts on it. The multiple endings also have distinct feels to them as well. The glitches and bugs were a bit of a hindrance on launch day, but the game has improved nicely for me since the hotfixes. 

This game really takes advantage of the Nvidia RTX line's capabilities with DLSS and to a lesser extent for my sytem, raytracing. I was able to comfortably run mostly ultra settings with DLSS set to quality or balanced and my FPS stayed near 60 or above in most areas. I will say in some sections this game absolutely chugs and I saw FPS lows down in the twenties.

All in all, I will say if you want to play this game I would wait for more patches and optimizations. There is a lot of fun to be had in Night City, but let CDPR put some more work in first to make it even better.

8/10

Pros:
Rich story
Meaningful supporting characters
Fun character progression
Keanu Reeves

Cons:
Some areas/situations can bring your PC to its knees
Obviously the bugs/glitches although some are hilarious
Wanted more time in the prologue"
1609734942,Absolutely love the game. Only few visual and sound bugs but none are game breaking.
1609734931,"Amazing game, didn't completely live up to hype, too much water 8/10. From a fanboy like me, I enjoyed it enough to recommend it. Maybe not game of the year but certainly worth a shot for those who don't mind what really is a beta right now.
The music is really great, I'm still asking myself ""Can you feel it!?""
Visuals are the main high point for me, fortunate I have a computer (mostly) capable of handling it, 2080RTX. The reflections, lighting, and details are really fantastic. Bugs, glitches, and little things hold this game back big time, but with time and polish I can see this game setting a whole new bar.
Personally I'm going to put this away until summer and hope it can really blow mind for a 2nd play-through."
1609734883,"CP2077 is a shell of its promises, buggy internals and full of illusion of choices. Reviews online are more than enough. But I'll recap: Bad Optimizations, Terrible Gameplay, cut features could be felt since the first hour, story is borderline B-rated movie. Wait for it to be at least half the price. Never pre-order a game again."
1609734879,"- I'll start with that I love this game and i'll always love this game now.
- the story of this game is amazing and i'll be playing it again and again feeling my GPU warming up my house because even with a GeForce RTX 2080TI XC has trouble keeping the FPS up. (I do have everything on max settings because the world in Cyberpunk looks so beautiful!. my eyes cannot get enough of it) 
- lots of bugs so please keep saving everyone, but I know the bugs will get fixed. 
- also, how can anyone say no to a game that has a lot of games into one like, fallout, Watch Dogs, GTA, and a dash of the (Matrix (the movie))<3"
1609734797,good game
1609735391,"lets me alt + tab

10/10"
1609734509,"This game does not revolutionize gaming, but it is a very solid open world action game. With even more content promised for the future, I believe this game to be a solid investment."
1609734490,"Why have Jackie as a big focus in the advertising if you're going to have him come and go so fast? A montage, really? Why don't you just give us missions together so we can actually get close to him? Why is Dex made to be such a big deal if he's there for like 2-3 missions? Feels like any characters that aren't romance options just walk in the door, spin around, then walk out like Grandpa Simpson. There's nothing to really progress towards in this besides the main story. Perk's are just passive bonuses. No Transmog slots so you look like a Cyberpunk Clown that got tar and feathered by a Leprechaun. Almost all the non sport cars are so fucking slow. I feel like it was a choice to make them that slow because if you get in one of the sports cars and blast it there's a lot of lighting issues that'll be fixed if you were driving slower. I'm disappointed that life paths were essentially just flavor text for conversations. There's no ending that corresponds with the Corpo life path despite Arasaka being such a massive part of the story. Sad"
1609734289,best game ever had
1609734221,"So i have completed everything the game has to offer. All achievements, all endings took me 100 hours exactly pretty much.

2 issues with the game, which everyone has heard about by now.
Bugs & The main story line is just way too short. 

Other then that the game is fantastic. So many different options to tackle combat and different dialogue choices. 

The way i see it, both major issues can be fixed by CD PROJEKT RED. Give us so good DLC and fix the bugs and the game will be great. 

I never came across any game ending bugs, not to say there isnt any out there. 

Will i play it again? probably not - apart from some romance options which to me isnt worth re-doing the whole game, there isnt much else to be accomplished. 

I've been a long time Deus Ex fan, so if you enjoy them you will enjoy Cyberpunk."
1609734134,Amazing
1609734109,preem gay content
1609734069,Bountiful penis.
1609734051,good
1609733861,"it took a little while to figure the game out, the tutorials don't explain much about the finer details of game play.  plenty of good videos on youtube though.  N E ways after I got my feet wet and started figuring out how to play the minor graphic bugs (i.e. distant trees pop up on the screen while driving.)  don't really bother me much and I'm actually impressed how well my  1050Ti is performing as many people said this game would need a really high end graphics card, I'll probably get a 3070 sooner or later but the game looks amazing as is."
1609733822,good stuff
1609733734,Broken game.
1609733677,"Cyberpunk 2077 doesn't live up to the massive amount of hype, but it's still a pretty fun open-world jankfest shooter/rpg from CDPR, who are widely known as creators of other very fun open-world RPG jankfests such as Witcher 1, Witcher 2, and Witcher 3. It's likely the most expensive piece of Eurojank ever produced [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwgEDr16pZY] (video breakdown here) [/url] and it's ambitious, atmospheric, and chock full of hidden places to explore. Once CDPR fixes the bugs and releases some DLC, I'm sure it'll improve from a good game to a great game. 
~Rating: CyberKeanu/10~"
1609733667,"Right off the bat, the game itself suffers from performance bugs, and some minor bugs during quests along with the clear removal content and content that can be seen in game that was not completed (missing parts of the map). But even with those issues this game still has a phenomenal story, great characters and a beautifully built world that once you start playing you don't want to stop."
1609733649,Awesome.
1609733634,lots of bugs. Waiting it's update
1609733520,"I never really followed the hype for this game, but I looked forward to playing it.  After all, I think the majority of us had a strong infatuation with CDPR after The Witcher series.  Aside from the obvious bugs and performance issues, the game had some brilliant moments.  However, even after doing nearly everything there is to do in this game, it still felt shallow.  I longed for the types of side quest The Witcher 3 gave, but they came few and far between.  There were some that I wish were developed a little more because they were truly interesting, but it felt like they ended prematurely.  I don't think I can replay this game as I have done CDPR other projects.  I still believe they will make this a great game, but as it stands now, I simply cannot recommend it."
1609733493,Wait until 2077 to play the game AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA this game sucks balls
1609733290,"I fucked my robot gf, she moaned. This game is sexy."
1609733267,"The game is great, might be just a little glitchy here and there but to me game-play and story line was dope"
1609733484,"Cyberpunk 2077 is a flawed game, but I do believe it will age well. While not ALL of its issues are just bugs and performance issues, they are the majority of my complaints. I will be comparing the mission structure and story to games such as Fallout and Skyrim, while comparing the world to Rockstar games like GTA 5 and RDR2. Starting off with the bad; the physics and interaction to the world. While I wouldn’t consider these to necessarily be bugs, they are a major hindrance to the realism of the game. For example, when you rear end a car, you will merely just drive under it or it will go flying in the other direction in an unrealistic way. It looks really dumb and takes away from the driving, which isn’t particularly strong in the first place. The hand to hand combat also ranges from generic at best to infuriating at its worst at. The Beat on the Brat side mission is the worst side mission I’ve seen in a long time. Ranged combat is ok, but certainly not bad. Next is the interaction with random, non essential NPCs. People you run into the street are more brain dead than NPCs in GTA. They literally add nothing to the game. They have no interesting conversations like in other games, and they are poorly modeled. The physics in general are bad. I know a more fair comparison to this game would be the buggy mess that is the Fallout series, but when compared to more polished games such as GTA, there is a noticeable difference in quality. (just look up gta 5 vs cyberpunk physics and watch the first video). Fortunately most of these problems have the potential to be fixed down the line, although they should have been done at launch. Night City was fun to explore, but I felt like it had an identity crisis. Again when compared to other open world games, it lacked identity. I enjoyed the open worlds  Fallout, GTA 5, and RDR2, because they all felt fleshed out and detailed. The fallout games, despite not being as graphically impressive or dense as Night City, were fun to explore because of the great lore, missions, and NPCs in the game. Each vault had a terrifying or interesting story attached to it, that made simple fetch missions exciting. On the other hand, gigs in Cyberpunk take you mostly generic places, taking out generic bullet sponge enemies. I suppose there are great stories to be told in these gigs if you take the time to explore them, but I eventually just got annoyed with them, and I did a lot of them. In terms of the actual map, it lacked diversity. There was essentially just the city and then the Mojave desert. The city was beautiful, even on medium settings in 2k on my 1080 TI, but exploring wasn’t as exciting as say RDR2. In RDR2, I would turn off the map, and explore the world using landmarks and road signs. Similarly in GTA5, you learn to memorize the world because of its points of interest. I can’t think of any noticeable point of interest in Cyberpunk except maybe the North Oak sign. The fact that the world feels so samey takes away significantly from exploring the map. Last in the complaint section is the main story. While the last mission, depending on if you do all the important side missions, is really fun, the rest feels short and kind of just abruptly ends. I remember when I first went to the last main mission and it told me that it was the last mission, I was really surprised. It didn’t feel like the ending at all. The main story does not stand on its own, you need to do the main side missions to get the most out of this game. The one place I would game excels is in its core side missions. The characters in these missions are really well acted and written.  It is in these moments, with Panam, Judy, River, and Delamin, that the game shines. They come off as genuine characters, and their missions reflect their characters goals, and motives. This is evident especially with Judy and her plans to liberate the joytoy club and with Panam and her power struggle against Saul. These characters carry an otherwise very flawed game. I must say as a side note, that Mr. Reeves is terrible in this game and gives the most stiff and awkward performance than any other main character in the game. Another thing  I really enjoyed was the music. As long as it wasn’t looping 15 minutes after a fight ended, it was always adrenaline pumping and exciting. This might sound like a really negative review, and in a way it is, but for the most part I did have an enjoyable experience, It just never reached the heights that I wanted it to (especially near the end, where the end game content is extremely lacking) 6.5/10"
1609733115,"Its good enough to be played even with the bugs, alot better than Fallout 4/76 on launch date."
1609733114,great game if you dont go into it expecting it to change the world like most of the people did. i put off the final mission for about 14 hours of gameplay because i was so in love with this game. highly recommend it. i ran into about 2-3 bugs but nothing big it was just a side mission bug so what ever. all you crying about how bad this game is should go play siege and play against cheaters then cry some more.
1609733061,I loved it.
1609732845,game sucks
1609732795,"Not bad, doesnt have nearly as much glitches"
1609732752,Fun game.  I'm enjoying the stealth aspects.  Lots of side quests which I like to do.
1609732714,"Yes, it has a few bugs. Yes, these bugs shouldnt exist because of the time, effort and money that has gone into the making of the game. But is it bad? NO.
The city is beautiful, every little detail has been taken care of. 
The cars look gorgeous, although driving mechanics could be better.
The side quests in this game are one of the best i have ever come across. 
Weapons look and sound good with proper support for mods.
Main story campaign is intriguing, with multiple endings (depending on what you do before you reach the final mission).
Last but not the least, KEANU REEVES, who puts in a majestic performance as Johny Silverhand.
The open world is second only to RDR2 and it loses because of the bugs. 

If you have the money, go for it because as a game, it is one of the best.
P.S - You will encounter a variety of bugs during the gameplay, which will hopefully be solved in upcoming updates."
1609732682,"Really not worth the money
Full of bugs and glitches, it has a good story line though and it really gets to the point

Honestly, I would refund this but steam never really lets you refund sh*t so yeah..."
1609732682,"great gramphics, grat grameplay, great soundtrack"
1609732652,W.O.W.
1609732650,"I will make this review short and sweet.  

The game is still broken.  To many game breaking bugs and crashes even after 70+hours of play that are preventing me from completing side quest and other quest within the game.  I am running 1080ti, i76700k, 32 gig ddr4.   This game is broken and a buggy mess for some and not so much for others.  I would suggest waiting a year or for a deep sale before buying this game.  Dont make the same mistake I did."
1609732591,"game hardly plays without constant freezing and crashing, would not recommend until more patches."
1609732495,game good
1609732492,"Great game so far, and has a lot of potential, but damn! tons of bugs to work out yet......"
1609732489,"I personally have not experienced any crashes and issues, therefore I would highly recommend it !"
1609732458,"game is fun, lots to do, very little bugs, good story."
1609732409,wathever everyone is saying I found this game very good
1609732352,"It has some bugs, sure. But the beauty, story, and game play sell it for me. It's a great game."
1609732190,Definitely recommended. Definitely.
1609731936,"Really enjoying the game, ofc there are bugs and a need for patches but at the end of the day its a really enjoyable game. would advice buying it on sale however.. gun play and driving feel very nice and well done. 40 hours in and haven't even finished the second act yet. PLENTY of side jobs and other activities to partake in."
1609731900,its alright
1609731858,"Not gonna lie I liked it but I would recommend to play it later when the bugs are fixed.
"
1609731804,I like it.
1609731717,was game
1609731622,"Let me put it simply.

You will like this game if:
- You ignored CDPR's marketing over the years and go into this game blind.
- Are a fan of RPG's and ""loot and shoots""
- Looking for something with a ton of play time and depth to it.
- Have a high-end PC that can run this game the way it is meant to be run.

You will hate this game if:
- You bought into the hype over the game caused by CDPR.
- Expecting ""The Witcher 3"" but in first person form. (The Witcher 3 is clearly the better game still, in my opinion.)
- Expecting GTA V level of gameplay (They shouldn't even be compared honestly. Not even remotely the same game).
- Are easily bothered by bugs/glitches.
- Have a low-spec PC. I have a hard enough time getting it to run properly on my RTX 3080 at 60 fps at Ultra 1440p with RTX and DLSS on.

I went into this game pretty blind. I purposely stayed away from all the marketing videos and trailers the past few months in order to form my own opinion. I really like this game. It's not like, amazing, but it far from a bad game. The story, visuals, and gameplay is actually quite good. That being said, I can see why some people are upset with the final product. If your open minded and ignore all the hate, I feel like you will enjoy the game quite a bit. However, if your opinion has already been formed based on the media and the angry fans, then you should not play this, or at the very least wait till everything is fixed. I am pretty confident that the devs will fix most of the issues over the course of the few months."
1609731575,your pp can glitch through your pants
1609731544,"Amazing and smooth combat, great variety in perks and skills to personalize and choose your approach, beautifully detailed world layout, and wonderful storytelling and character development. 10/10 recommend for any open world enthusiast. Cant get bored playing this game."
1609731389,Love this game!
1609731195,"Current time of review is how long it took me to complete a single playthrough. 

Good game. Needs Polish!"
1609731170,"Despite all bugs and launch problems, its still one of the best games of 2020"
1609731075,The game is beautiful and for what it is now a great frist person shooter. It doesn't feel like an rpg at all. I had high hopes for project cd red. As my frist game on pc was the frist witcher. That's when I found my love for rpg. Right now it's unplayable due getting calls you reject ever couple of mins. In short this a phone spam simtialor.
1609731066,If your pc can fun it and you can get past the bugs it is a really good game.
1609731064,Bugs haven't really ruined my experience. Still a good game.
1609730926,Buggiest game I've ever played. Constantly have to find little glitches to continue the story because the missions bug out. lots of potential really bad (literally broken) implementation.
1609730889,"Bugs? Yes
Fun? Yes

Wait until CDPR gets more hotfixes in, and it's gonna be amazing. Currently 5/7.
"
1609730881,"Immersive game with a great aesthetic that sits somewhere between Fallout and GTA. If you are looking for the level of story you'd get in the Witcher series, you'll be disappointed. It's definitely a bit thin in comparison - but still a great game by its own virtues. There are some glitches and quirks that can be a bit annoying and the driving and melee mechanics are a bit clunky, but overall I've enjoyed playing it."
1609730790,Open world. Story. Graphics.
1609730719,"As someone that came into this game having not seen a single bit of ""hype"" or news, only hearing a tiny bit about it from friends in the past year, it's a great game and I fully recommend it.

You can tell they couldn't really decide what they wanted it to be, linear story, open RPG, etc, but whatever it is, it's fun.

The game has so much to talk about I couldn't condense it here if I wanted to but, If you think you can look past some (usually funny) bugs, and beyond the shallow parts they didn't finish, deep within you can find a true diamond in the rough."
1609730510,games really good and fun but more buggy than one of those off road cars 8/10
1609730426,"After ~160 hours as of this review, two level 50 characters later I still haven't been able to finish the fucking game due to my saves crashing the game. Give it a year."
1609730319,Lots fun even with lots of bugs.
1609730292,you get to play with weenie size!!!!! :D
1609730284,"What with all the complaints, I've had a great time, and still am.
Sure I've had a bug here and there, but they were minor for me at worst, and didn't really do anything to hurt my personal experience.
The many different skills certainly helps you build the way you want the play.
The guns feel pretty good and substantial.
The story isn't that bad, to be honest.
Defining moment for me was zooming down the street at 100 kph and suddenly, for no apparent reason, my character is standing on the motorcycle, showing the entire city who's the boss, then my clothes simply disappeared.
Racing through the city, in full T pose, with my cock flapping in the wind.
10/10.  Laughed my ass off."
1609730133,It's aight
1609730119,"Pros

No in game purchases
Amazing story
and im sure you know the rest

Cons

I wish the game had more direction and reason to play the side missions other than completion/stuff
Better overall feel. it just doesn't play like gta. Missing something

9.5/10 but its a better experience with a high end pc"
1609730092,i mean at least it's playable
1609730006,i love it
1609729907,Great Game lots of bugs but whatever still worth it.
1609729855,"From the gripping story telling, to the rich world and detail, this game is easily already one of my all time favorites."
1609729849,Glitches are everywhere However if you look past them the game is Awesome!!!!!!!
1609729649,"open world is lackluster. So is the AI, but the game is gorgeous and the story is pretty decent. 7.5/10"
1609729641,"I have loved every minute of this game and I have experienced bugs.  There have been bugs that tossed out the bottom of the map and killed me.  Those bugs have been fixed.  What i'm trying to get at is this game has been put on this pedestal so high that if it released with no bugs what so ever and every generation could play it perfectly fine their would still be people who would complain about it.  People saw this game as the game that make 2020 a fantastic year but at the end of the day it is just a game.  I have found easy to immerse myself for hours at a time in this game, it is a really good game that i think most people would enjoy.  Thats why even with all the refunds that CD Project Red is giving the game is still a tremendous success.  People know the game has glitches but the game itself and the environment is so good that people are willing to ignore the refund and continue to play.  If you are thinking about buying this game you will here a good chunk about negative things probally more so than positive things.  But it is a lot easier for any game or anything in general to say something negative about it than to say something positive.  I could go on an hour rant about why the Last of Us 2 was a bad game and didn't deserve game of the year but there was positive to that game.  To summarize, if your on the fence about buying it just buy it.  You won't regret it, you might see the occasional bug but, the updates have been regular and eliminating a lot of them.  And even so the game draws you in enough to not even care about them."
1609729520,"So much Good, Also many bug. Delicious sweet bug."
1609729508,"so basically I was playing this game and yeah it does cause my computer to run hotter than the core of the sun but it do be a good game I liked the part where you were with the big guy and he was like ""He waiting"" and also the part where Keanu Reeves shows up and when he talks about his impressive cock was pretty cool overall I think its a great game they should port it to the xbox 360 too because I really liked the xbox 360 and I played fallout new vegas on that and this game reminds me of fallout new vegas because there are guns and I like games with guns such as persona 3 festival edition which if you didnt know Akihiko in that game is voiced by one of the new vegas voice actors but yeah they summon their personas by shooting themselves in the head with a gun and its pretty cool because it represents accepting death but yeah they should put it on steam like they did with persona 4 the golden edition because its really good and Makoto Yuki is a cool protagonist I really connect with him and furthermore the driving in the game is really good I can feel how they made it for drifting and stuff because the cars naturally drift without using the handbrake it reminds me of the cars maters stories movie when they were in japan and doing a drifting race"
1609729467,"Haven't found many glitches, I believe most of them occur on the consoles (i was looking forward to them too). Game is a ton of fun, I really enjoy it. Lot's of detail, plenty to do - hasn't gotten old yet."
1609731048,"Masterpiece.

If you play a game this year, play this one.

This is everything I imagined a Shadowrun game actually being, and more.

I didn't get on the hype-train for the game and intentionally avoided running into any spoilers while playing through it -- it was worth it. I avoided the massive salt mines of social media for this game.

Go into it blind. It's worth it.

Thought Cyberpunk had the hype to be game of the century, its many flaws left much disappointed and much to desire.  This game feels like it is hanging on a thread. The game practically lies to you with its dumb AI and magic tricks.  People might link this to the countless bugs, but no, this is more of a game design problem then a silly bug. Those stupid cars wont move around a object in its way because they are programed to go only one path, if anything stops it, it will just sit there. Those people that appear and disappear are programed to do that for the illusion of busy streets. What happened to the smart AI promised from the Devs? The ones that lived out daily routines? I followed some guy and he just did the same things over and over.  For my first 16 hours of gameplay, I was under this illusion that the game only had some bugs and issues that needed fixed. I was too busy being blinded by the story and the beautiful graphics. But after this, I realized the sad truth. This is only one of the many major problems. 


Though I feel some of these issues cant be fixed, I hope they can, for this game has some promise. I speak bad things about this game like a disappointed dad, I still love it but I'm disappointed in its issues. I really enjoyed the story and I LOVED the countless interesting side quests. Once they bring Night City true life, I'll be back with open arms. I hope with the mods and bug-fixes, this game will make a comeback. If you want to get this game, wait for a sale or for the bug fixes. I'm sure you can at least have a little fun with this Cybernetic world because at least, I know I did."
1609729325,Needs a few more patches but overall it is a very great game
1609729285,became a cyber ninja. got a hot girlfriend. Any neckbeard's wet dream. 9/10 if you have a pc that can run it
1609729172,Just what I was expecting from it :)
1609729153,"only 20% through the main quest line and at almost 30 hours in.  anyone scared this game doesnt have alot there from reviewers dont be.  this game and city is DENSE.  If your someone who enjoyed skyrim or the fallout games you will love this, its amazing.  Also ive been doing tons of side quests and missions and each one is different in terms of having its own mini story in each one, and sure not every single thing is going to have some major impact on the game, thats just an unrealistic expectation.  but the density of content here is incredible, if your the type to pay attention to the small details.  if you want to sprint by everything in the world guns blazing and beat it in 25 hours go for it, but your missing the point of the experience.

"
1609729031,"Not optimised well,story is a little short and has many many bugs that do take away from the game often times but if your looking for a single player experience where you can immerse yourself into a beautiful world and great story then this game will do exactly that."
1609729014,So far run's fine with zero glitches. I don't have a powerful computer either. I am guessing the problems I hear about are mostly console based. Fun game!
1609728974,"I mean you've gotta be kidding me, right? This game can't be this good.... there's no way..."
1609728787, Breathtaking!
1609728735,VERY SEXY TITS AND COCK ME LIKE A LOT
1609728726,"I have encountered lot of bugs in the game, but its still the best game for me."
1609728664,You look like a cut of fuckable meat. Are you?
1609728649,7 years was a bit too much but I'm this is great
1609728874,"Positives:
- Voice acting is 10/10. 
- Ray-tracing and DLSS work wonders. 
- Gunplay isn't bad for an open world like this. 
- Parkour. Parkour. Parkour. 

Negatives:
- Game is not finished. Not even close. 
- There are areas of the map that have no collision/textures.
- Possible to get stuck in walls/fall through ground randomly.
- Traffic sprites are so poorly done I thought I was on PS1 when I sat on top of a building (high settings).
- The desert has invisible walls in random places that are clearly still in bounds on the map.
- Two of my quests are bugged and I cannot progress two major side stories.
- Accessing the developer console to fix broken quests/items/etc requires third party tools. 
- NPC's T-pose all. the. time. Even during cut-scenes.
- Audio (esp dialogue) cuts out randomly. 
- Traffic glitches. Look out for flying, explodey cars. Esp around the city center. 
- You will see the same NPC copy cut/pasted in groups walking down streets. 
- Can't change your character's appearance at all, even hair after the character creation screen. 
- Customization as a whole is super limited.
- You cannot edit/customize vehicles. 
- Clothes are surprisingly limited. Esp if you want good stats. 
- Cars/NPC's disappear randomly.
- Can't easily target loot. Sometimes forcing you to pick up lots of junk to get to the quest item or item you actually wanted. 
- Driving feels like a hovercraft, but worse.

What starts out as a mysterious, brutal, and in-your-face narrative settles quickly into very predictable RPG choices.
After finishing many side quests and looking up alternate options, it was very disappointing to find ""illusion of choice"" is strong in many places. Your character ""background"" is just a montage clip at the beginning of the game and only opens up a few extra dialog options that do nothing. 

Wait this one out, they have to patch it up to playable. Wait a long time."
1609728514,"Incredibly good Story so far, graphics and performance are amazing (except Raytracing, even with a RTX 2070 Super it costs 30-40 FPS on 1440p), practically infinite side jobs, different playstyles possible, plenty of character development possibilities, I just love it. I had a bigger break after 40 hours, but I will finish the game soon. Probably will edit the review then. But it hooks me four hours and makes me forget the worlds problems, it's really awesome, I missed that."
1609728500,"When this game out and the initial reviews came in, I was skeptical. It sounded to me like No Man's Sky all over again - a massive title that just didn't live up to the hype, and worse than that: it was a buggy, unplayable mess, and a betrayal of consumer trust. Yet, when a few of my friends got the game, they had nothing but praise for it. Finally, human curiosity won, and I purchased my copy and started playing.

It took me around 30 hours to beat the game, as I only resolved a few side quest chains, but I fully intend on doing a second run through the game, and spending a lot more time on the optional content. 

TL;DR - Give it a chance. It's one of my favorite games of all time, and it's worth every penny... if you don't mind Bethesda level bugs.  For more detail, see below.

Cyberpunk 2077 is a beautiful, immersive work of art that pulls you in with charming characters, incredible scenery, through world building, and interesting and meaningful side content that feels just as important as the main story... until a bug comes along and rips you out of the experience. 

PROS:
- Amazing characters. Each of them feel unique and have a level of depth to them, and their dialogue is supported by great performances from the actors. This is a game that is carried by the interactions the player has with the characters in the world, and the decisions and quest lines provided by them. Easily the highlight of the game, in my opinion - every conversation with an NPC was enjoyable, and nearly every new character I met became a favorite.

- Stunning attention to detail. The world of Night City has so much atmosphere and depth to it in no small part due to the outrageous level of detail put into the environments - the insides of vehicles, the run down alleys and graffiti, to the visible threads on clothing, it's candy for your eyes. 

- Adaptive story. Your choices in Cyberpunk genuinely effect the outcomes of the story - whether it be side quests or the main story line. It makes for choices that feel important, and gives weight to the situations you find yourself in, because you're very aware that you got their through your own actions. It's a game that lends itself to multiple runs this way.

CONS:
Combat - It's kinda dull. Compared to the rest of the game, it really doesn't stand out from other titles, which is a shame, given the variety of ways you're given to approach it. It's not unbearable, but I found myself stealthing around not because I really wanted to do a stealth build, but it was more fun to try and avoid and get past enemies than fight them.

Driving - The cars feel like they don't obey friction at all. Just drive a motorcycle and save yourself the headache.

Bugs - I'm talking Skyrim level bugs here. I had to reload saves a few times because NPCs or quest enemies just didn't spawn, or animations would break and people would slide around the floor, my vehicle would get stuck on nothing, etc. In a game where one of it's selling points is how immersive it can be, they're really frustrating, and can take you out of the experience. Not to mention the AI would just forget where I was, or the group of attacking enemies would kinda just... sit there and wait for me to aggro them at the edge of the area I was supposed to defend.

Wasted Open World - Mostly, Night City served as a hubworld that felt real and had atmosphere, but was shallow. More of a backdrop to drive through on my way to the next quest, with the occasional opportunity to make money along the way. It didn't really take away from the game, but it didn't add to it other. I would have loved to see more focus put on civilian interactions with the player based on the state of the city, group reputations, or anything else to make Night City feel as adaptable and responsive to the player as the characters who inhabit it.

All in all, it's a very fun game with very clear weaknesses. If you respond to rich characters and stories, atmosphere, and world building, a definite recommend. If you're looking for an advanced combat system that actively challenges you, or an open world with a variety of deep interconnections and distinct groups and places, I'd advise caution. To my understanding, CDPR is going to be releasing a patch or two to deal with the bugs, so if you think they will bother you, I would hang on a little bit. In my opinion, however, the game is perfectly playable as is."
1609728430,Bugs make it better.
1609728301,"Bugs have only been minor graphical glitches, cigarettes floating in midair and such.

Plot and story do a great job at maintaining time pressure to keep with the main story and are very well written and acted. 

Very pretty world, polished systems. Mantling and things like that are all there and intuitive and smooth. Good flow to combat, feels like there are multiple paths which are distinct and fun."
1609731927,"All I can say about this game is...

Oof.

First off. There is a reason you see no footage of your own character. There is a reason they scrapped third person view. 

The best gear my guy has right now is an Olive Greed Fedora, Leapord Print Wifebeater, Open Rainbow Puff Vest, Shiny White Diamond Glitter MC Hammer Pants, Purple and Pink Moon Boots, and a chinese Samurai Mask. 

I'm sure some people would find that freaking awesome, but after a while, it really starts to feel bogged down and clunky that I can't really make any decent choices in what to wear unless I want to severely gimp myself and go for a crafting build. Even then I'm not sure what the level of choice would be then either.

I would say a solid 98% of the hours I've spent in this game are after saying ""ARE YOU F*@#&*ING KIDDING ME"" and then walking away from my man cave for a solid full day with the game still running in the background, on the few occasions I came to give it another go.

I can tell you, this game has zero replay value. It's a freaking slog. Ugh. Those first few missions. Having to go through the stupid Brain Dance Tutorial, etc. It sucked after having done it only one time before, that's pretty sadge.

This game reminds me of Chris Roberts Star Citizen, except rather than claiming to do something game breaking or revolutionary, they are just straight up copy pasting Fallouts entire genre and mixing it with Borderlands. 

The game as it sits, is basically just a tech demo for ray tracing. The sad part is they didn't even suffer from feature creep. They simply left out a shit ton of basic features. It was basically just gonna be Morrowind of the future. But it's not even anything like that... It's like Crash Bandicoot compared to Morrowind or Witcher 3's depth.

The only saving grace is small things like when Keanu Reeves starts being your homie and egging you on to do shit, like whoop a dudes ass who is betting his car against you in a fist fight.  

Speaking of that fight. The first real quest you get after getting some false sense of ""open world freedom"" is a fist fight quest. You win a quick easy fight and then get offered to do a bunch of fights around the city, to build your name up for some ""real lucrative"" type fights. It seems like straight up Mike Tyson Punchout is about to go down. You start small and build your way up.

Nope. The first dudes I went to fight were level 20. I'm freaking level 5 man. These dudes had cybernetic implants I had some level 1 eyes, that's it. wtf? It's like the quest giver saw me whoop dude and just wanted me to go get some immediate humbling. Okay? 

The dude I mentioned before who bets his car? He's level 30.  The first mission in the game just leads you on this impossible mission to do stuff that is somehow level gated. Why not just not even have it appear until I can do it. Just give me a call, like the other 500 random people who just pile on cold calls to my number. Why did they decide to just bombard you all at once with all these impossible missions? 

The idea behind everything is pretty cool, but it's just.... such a watered down abandoned disfigured premature fetus abomination in a dumpster compared to what was set as a precedent by all the hype/media/press releases/interview put forth by the studio since inception.

I wonder if they thought people would just overlook everything and somehow chalk it up to it being the next ""Crysis"" or something, and blame hardware. To give them time to code the rest of the game by the time hardware catches up or something.

This game is actually WORSE than Mafia 2/3 were... I haven't seen a game this buggy since Warhammer Online Alpha. 

I can't say how sick I am of restarting the game because it decided a certain portion of the game is not going to work now. Sound, Graphics, Combat Feature, AI, Quest NPC's, Item Interaction, Vehicles. You literally NEVER know when or what is going to break. It just breaks and you're screwed. And hope to god you have a recent save because half the time if you save after the bug, the bug remains.

It's like Fallout. With extra things that don't work and minus alot of the things that did.

I don't see how they can really come back to fix a game that was released in this state. 

It's like someone selling a car on craigslist that says ""she runs like a charm"" but then shows up with 5 huge boxes full of engine parts and asks where they will be sleeping in your house for the next 2 years while they rebuild the car to sell you, later, but they need the money now."
1609728212,JUST TRY IT
1609728155,"fortnite
"
1609728080,Lots of bugs and small issues but still a fun game if you wanted to scratch that itch for a game like Deus ex like i was having
1609728296,"A heartwarming story about an unemployed man and his imaginary friend. Meet ""V"", a disaffected returnee to Night City who aims to finally step off the dole by taking odd jobs. With the aid of a whole cast of temp employment brokers, ""V"" will catch up on his rent, pay back his medical loan, buy a new car, and maybe even find love and career success in Night City!"
1609728036,"Still buggy but rarely game breaking for me - more persistent bugs were patched for me, in 6 months it'll probably be among best games ever made, right now it's a very engaging and interesting Sci-Fi ARPG that's far from perfect. 
2 other negatives - game looks pretty average albeit insane scale & detail, the Witcher 3 looks better to me atm but I imagine that'll improve as they increase optimisation or if I get an RTX card lol
- the driving is pretty balls, I'm used to it now but you have to get used to 1s input lag and poor turning of the vehicles (probably not unrealistic), most people will hate it for sure."
1609727996,Best open world ive ever seen besides the 4 million bugs
1609727956,Great game; buy it in a year.
1609727941,Fun.
1609727850,"I liked the game that is why I have played more than 100 hours.
So, Why I am not recommending the game? Ignoring the bugs (there are MANY as of Version 1.06) The game is a LIE and what they advertised in their multiple trailers and GAMEPLAY over the years is a LIE.
Your choices DO NOT MATTER. The best example is in the video ""Lifepaths"" trailer on Youtube and see for yourself.  This is not what they promised, it is not about the hype or us gamers ""pressuring"" CD Projekt Red to release the game. As many videos on Youtube points out the problems with Cyberpunk 2077 go WAY BEYOND the bugs and glitches. 
AI is terrible. check the multiple videos about police in Cyberpunk 
There are no physics in Cyberpunk 
Basic features of Open world games missing. (Try getting a simple haircut in Cyberpunk)
Lack of balancing. Either you one shot or do no damage at all. (I Played on Hard)
They Advertised a GREAT AMOUNT of RPG elements. But, Your romance options in game You Gay or Nah?
AGAIN, my problem with this game is not that it is fun. MY PROBLEM is that it was supposed to be the next BIG THING. Not According to us gamers but to them and their trailers.

So.... If you want to have fun go ahead and buy it because it is a fun game just don't expect too much. (buy it on sale if you can)


"
1609729113,"I actually like this game, its got a really good story, but I can't recommend it. Instead of writing a lengthy review, I'll link a video, for anyone with spare time and a newly born hatred towards the deceitful CD Projekt Red. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CymqHdNYkg&t=1377s"
1609727759,"I am a big fan of CD Projekt Red (or was, idk yet, mixed feelings), so I was waiting for this game for years and was so excited to finally get to play it, but after full clearing the game and seeing all the endings, I am so disappointed. The game is full of bugs and glitches, its impossible to go 5 mins without encountering one, the shooting feels serviceable, melee and melee weapons are horrible, dialogue options are just an illusion, they barely impact the story, the AI is braind dead, etc etc etc. But the thing that is the most wrong with this game is the lies, so many lies, CD Projekt Red did not make the game they promised. The game is nothing like the trailers. Just re-watch one of their gameplay trailers from a year or two ago, and so many of the things they promised and features are just not in the game. This is a half-baked game that needed at the least 2 more years to be completed. CDPR just lost me on this one. I hope that in a year from now they can get this game to state that at least looks like the game they showed in trailers, because that is the one I was excited to play, not this thing that we ultimately got."
1609727728,"Recommending with but, to this game, its about expectation. 
If you're looking for taking a good ride of story driven game RPG, with not too much of route complicity. Then this game outdoes itself. 
You will find a very immersive main story, not only making you feels like in the movie, it makes you feels like you're playing out a movie, with one certain breath taking actor along the way. 
Also, there're around 90 side stories and mission, with decent detail and effort put into it, will bring more surprise than repetition.
With enough of combat variant and character buildup to serve role-playing purpose, it goes well with story progressing.
BUT!
Even until patch 1.06, the game still have bug. Didn't run into game-cracking, self-locking bug, however, it only take few wacky NPC behavior or graphic bug to break its perfect immersion you had few second ago.
And if you're expecting some very diverse and complicated story, with every choice count and chance could out-smart script writer, then you will only find disappointment and more bug.
Combat and character buildup does serve role-playing well, however, that's about that. You won't find too much depth in it, you would find more way to abuse the system and hilariously break the game.

So, in conclusion. 
If you're able to over-look its ugly side, this would be a 9/10 game for you. However, even if you can't, with around 25 to 75 hrs of game time, you still have a 6 - 7/10 game, with decent amount of content.
Won't tell you to rush buying the game, want to wait a year or two for sales? Good idea. Or craving for some nice story RPG during this holiday season with not much to do? Feel free to get it now."
1609727684,"Ok, so here is what I love about this game:
- Panam Palmer
- Goro Takemura
- The main questline and all the choices you can make which influence the whole story
- The depth that is the lore and all the random shards you can find that have long paragraphs of whatever even though they have such a tiny chance of even being read. I have about a billion shards on my most-played save and I haven't really read any of them unless they were for a mission.
- the gunplay and fighting makes it so incredibly fun I can't really put it into words. My favourite thing to do is use a shotgun and blast bitches away (literally, sometimes) or use the gorilla arms to dunk on somebody. What is a shame is that the long blades are so limited it gets kinda boring? Just machetes and katanas... yikes.

What I'm not a fan of:
- Hardly any customisation (let me expand): for an rpg, the level of customisation is disappointing. After creating your character, there is no way (without mods or using the console) to change the looks of V. Can't even find a barber to change your hairstyle or a tattooist to get some sick new 'ink' or some cooler piercings. Additionally, it's disappointing to see that you can't change how your weapons and vehicles look, no different paintjobs or attachments, no visuals can be changed. 
- What was also annoying was that V's apartment has barely a reason to visit, there's no real gain from visiting except for dumping iconic weapons in the stash and forgetting about them until you find another iconic weapon. And not every iconic weapon is shown on the walls, which imo is pretty dumb.
- Want to look cool and have good stats on your clothes? Hah, good luck with that. You either look cool and have low to average stats or look like a fucking clown but have really good stats. This stinks and something needs to be done about it, maybe something like layered or transmog would be good.
- Not enough Panam, tbh. Need moar.
- We don't see enough of the stubborn boy Takemura, I was honestly hoping you could romance him when you meet him properly but sorely disappointed when there was no such opportunity.
- There was also a lack of variety in the visual side of things for V (i.e. body shape, hair, tattoos, piercings, etc...) and was slightly disappointed when there was only the male and female body types which cannot be changed other than peen or no peen or boobs or no boobs.  (I need my stonkingly strong woman with tight af abs or I will literally die.)
- I encountered so many sound bugs it was actually painful. Car chases often had no sound, or they did but it would all happen after they had ended. Stuff would make noises after they would happen, and during holo calls it would sound like the person was standing next to me rather than on the holo, kinda weird ngl. I have encountered nothing gamebreaking just yet, but I hope nothing like that does happen.

Despite the difference in size for my good and bad points, I love this game and I anticipate a major update and co-op, that hopefully both will add to the hugely intense game that is Cyberpunk 2077."
1609727657,"Night city is one of the most immersive places in video game history. I am 60 hours in but have yet to finish the game. But from what I've played so far, this is probably going to be my GOTY."
1609727635,is fun
1609727584,"This is a great game, yes there are some bugs, but nothing that won't be ironed out eventually. I really don't know why so many people are saying that it doesn't run. I haven't had any trouble playing through it multiple times on different characters. (my PC is average at best)"
1609727425,"I cant even start the actual gameplay because as soon as i finish customizing my 12 inch cock the game freezes in the loading screen and then crashes. I just spent 60 bucks on a game where i just wanted to pet the fucking cat but i immediatley encountered a bug rendering this game unplayable. There isnt even any fix for this unholy abomination. the fuck should i do? ""bitch, upgrade your drivers."" Take a good fucking guess what i just did! ""Perhabs you should verify the game files?"" GUESS WHAT MY COMPUTER DID FOR THE LAST 5 HOURS! I CAME HERE FOR CATS AND CUSTOMIZABLE DICKS BUT NO!"
1609727423,AMAZING!!!!
1609727324,real neat
1609727181,"This is an interesting game to review. The bugs and unfinished aspects of this game are inexcusable, but Cyberpunk is not the first to commit these sins, and it will not be last. There are many games that have gone down this path and gone on to become excellent titles (No Man's Sky, Rainbow 6: Siege, For Honor, Star Wars Battlefront 2, uh... the Witcher 3, and the list goes on and on). It is a shame on the industry that we are at this point, but no amount of ""nO pReOrDeRs"" memes will bring us back from the brink. Consumers have made their bed, and this practice is here to stay.

So, all of that under consideration, and as someone who's hype level was as close to 0% as possible (ended up buying it on a whim), this game is some of the most fun I have ever had, and the storylines have brought me in as much as other favorites of mine (Bioshock: Infinite, KOTOR, Spec Ops: The Line).

Yes, there is much to be lacking in the open world, the police system is laughable, there are not many recreational things to do, but the sheer amount of fun side-quests and the massively varied ways that you can approach combat situations (seriously, nothing more satisfying than eliminating everyone in a building through the power of the internet without stepping foot inside) gives this game a ton of quality content at launch. And, to the contrary of many comments, there is a strong foundation to build upon for future expansions.

Yes, the game is laughably broken at times, and I won't say that's a reason to buy, even though I have had many good laughs over it, but this is still a good game that almost surely will, with time, become a must-play."
1609727112,"Despite the issues this game had launch it is still one of the best games I've played in a long while. I'm sure that  CD Project Red will have the issues ironed out in time but until then, mods. Which, if i'm being honest mods are really where games like this shine on PC. I wouldn't recommend this game in it's current state but give it six months or so and I feel like it will be every bit worth the price tag."
1609727086,good
1609727002,"This game has its flaws graphically, especially regarding optimization as of release. Otherwise it has a great, engaging story, something which I could compare to Fallout: New Vegas. 8/10 RPG"
1609727000,Yes.
1609726938,"If you want a story telling, adventurous and action game, this game is very good. The main story and side job is immersive and interesting. Some of the side jobs are actually main job quality (unlike GTA, go X and kill that guy). 
Night city is beautiful, with photo mode it's even better. 
I played 66 hours while writing this review, yet i havent finished all the main stories and ""main"" side job (with river and judy). So if you play normally, without going too hard, just enjoying the game, this game and it's story worth around 70-80 hours i estimated. It is very worth the price if you ask me. As a normal linear action game such as dishonored/bioshock has only 12-15 hours game play time. But ofc their level design is more complicated and detailed, but still depends on what r your looking for. 

But this game is far from perfect. Here are something that has to be improved, especially they said it should be a RPG game :
1. smarter AI, you know what i meant, the AI is dumb, pedestrian and drivers are dumb, they walk in a scripted route with no AI, they wont fight back they wouldnt even flee sometimes. 
2. realistic police, police just teleports and spawns from your blind side, its not fun, everyone wants to mess around and kill some pedestrians, but the overpowered police just spawned behind you and one shot you, maybe its a way for CD projekt to discourage messing around so that you cant find out the AI is dumb. Hope they could add police car chase, and normal police AI just like GTA V, would solve the problem.  
3. customization, as promised, we should be at least able to change our hair style and tatoos, even face. But no, you cant do this in game. 
4. smarter enemey, the enemy are dumb sometimes, they should be smarter and challenging (not flat damage increase but the way they react) 

Overall i will give this game 9/10 as a story telling game (mainly interact with story chacaters), but 5/10 as a RPG game (interact with the world). THere are much potential in Night City, hope CD could fix these in the near future, or its a waste especially if you look at what the art team has done,"

There have been a few bugs and glitches but overall the content of the actual game has been terrific and I've enjoyed it quite a bit. The game gets a bad rap because it doesn't play well on the last-gen consoles, but to those players I'd tell them to play on Stadia instead."

1609726765,"As of 01/03/2020 I have officially given up on this game until further notice. Let me explain why.

I bought this game and for the first 6 hours I was just trying to get it to play for more than 5 minutes. Finally I start getting somewhere and I am able to play for longer periods of time; eventually culminating in me being able to play for 5+ hours. For three days I was able to enjoy this game and what it has to offer; good story, decent animations, cool cars, and fun (albeit repetitive) combat. Then the crashes came back...I literally have no idea why it's crashing again...and at a point where the plot was starting to pick up; it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I have a decent machine (I think) and don't see a reason for this to happen. Until this game is fixed with later patches and/or optimisation I have to give it a thumbs down!

Pros
1. Characters. The characters in this game are numerous and unique. Jackie Welles, Judy Alvarez, Panam, River Ward, Rogue, Alt Cunningham, Johnny Silverhand. All of these characters and more are awesome and well thought out in this game and I love how their models are animated as they're talking with you giving personality and giving appropriate non verbal communication. This game didn't just tell you this is Jack and he's your best friend, it showed you and made you live through it and love the guy. 
2. The Sandbox. Sandbox games are very vast these days and luckily this one has one of the most beautiful sandboxes to explore. Night City has countless breathtaking views of the city skyline and the way the desert looks in the early morning is perfect despite Saguaro Cacti not being anywhere close to that part of California in real life, but hey this is an alternate timeline and they probably changed the environment for all I know. It's fun to explore, and in multilayered areas like Downtown and Japantown it gets a little disorienting at times with just how huge it all is. 
3. The Story. Being in the slightly futuristic dystopian setting along with works like Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Bladerunner, Total Recal, etc. this game managed to nail the trippy hopeless future vibe that many of those captured beatifully and horrifyingly. I won't go into details on what happens to your character, but know that if you're a fan of this type of material and that type of mindf*cking you will not be disappointed.   
4. Great 1st Person Perspective. So FPS only games usually don't do well as RPG games, but somehow this game managed to capture the right proportions to nail the first person perspective and I really have to give it props for being able to successfully put the player into the body of an actual avatar in a way that feels good. 
5. Music. This game has a bunch of tunes that were whipped up just for this game. While I would have liked to see a more diverse selection of musical genres I was pleasantly surprised to find most of the music was pretty decent and the ambient soundtrack to this game gave me some real Ghost in the Shell vibes and I really dug it. 
6. Use of Keanu Reeves. Honestly I loved the advertising they did with Keanu and like many I assumed they would bring him in for a handful of lines give him a hefty check for a single days work and wave goodbye. Just like Patrick Stuart in Elder Scrolls Oblivion. Luckily CD Projekt Red kept Keanu around for quite some time since, not to get spoiler heavy, he's in the game quite a bit. 
7. Replayability. There are different beginnings middles and ends to this game with various different builds and a level cap that prevents you from being a perfect jack of all trades with everything maxed character. I will be playing this game one, two, possibly more times, and the game was already around 70ish hours when I didn't do every side quest or random blip on the map for about half the city. 

Cons
1. Bugs/Glitches/Performance Issues. Lets face it this game has serious issues with its integrity. While playing there were countless bugs in my 70ish hour full playthrough on my main character. Hopefully some patches will be coming out within the next few months and this game will run as intended, but until then that really affects my feelings towards this game. It really does say something that Skyrim has been dethroned as the most buggy mainstream video game of all time. 
2. Lack of customization options throughout the game. I remember hearing a dev promise that you'd be able to make whatever type of a character you could imagine and of course I fell for the honeyed words. They said that you could play as a male and have any haircut in the game that the females had. Unfortunately even this little thing was untrue since I'm a dude and I have long hair in real life and was greeted with RPG character creation I would have expected from a decade ago. To put it short, I couldn't find anything close to my haircut in the game. When I made a female character to see what the options looked like there I was unpleasantly surprised to find plenty of haircuts with ponytails and such. While that isn't enough to ruin an experience it is annoying when you're promised that this wasn't the case for this game only for it to be the first thing you're greeted with. Then to top that off there was no way to change anything appearance-wise about your character after creation save for your arm and hand body mods. No barber shops. No tattoo parlors. Not even facial reconstruction available at the Ripperdocs. This was disappointing since I expected more from a game about creating whoever you wanted to create. 
3. Terrible Vehicle Driving. This game is spent in a huge metropolitan city. In this city you must get from place to place. Often times I chose to hoof it to a fast travel station because driving is difficult and the impacts are disappointing, inconsequential, and carried no impact. Often times for the racing missions there wasn't any skill required since by the time you could do those missions you have the money to buy high performance sports cars and its easy to complete, but not fun to do. The main reason why this is such a big negative for me is because the sandbox of this game is so good, but the way you get around that sandbox is this mess. Also to go with the number 2 con above the cars in this game aren't able to be customized or upgraded from how they are when you receive them. 
4. Illusion of Choice in Dialogue. I really don't like when games give you a couple of options that are completely weightless and this game is littered with them. 
5. Lackluster Combat. Fighting is usually the meat and potatoes to most games, and unfortunately for Cyberpunk 2077 it does make up the brunt of actual gameplay and lets just say that I was much more enthusiastic about the Cyberpunk demo we saw years ago with the player crawling up walls and doing all sorts of crazy stuff to helpless dudes below. Unfortunately those types of combat innovations were completely scrapped and we're left with a combat system that is a bit worse than Fallout 4's. It's not awful, but it could have been much better. There's just nothing that makes combat in Cyberpunk 2077 unique to any other FPS out there. 
6. Lack of Animations. In a game where you can easily pump in 100+ hours a playthrough it's pretty lame that there's only one kill animation per weapon, and that you only get to see what the operation looks like for two body mods. I was very interested in this stuff going into the game and to see it omitted or restricted to one animation I get to see a thousand times is a bit of a let down. 

Don't let my super analytical delve into the pros and cons fool you, overall I really enjoyed my time with Cyberpunk 2077 and while I'm not hesitant to admit it has plenty of problems and has some obvious issues keeping it from being a great game I am saddened that it has received such a huge backlash from its launch since games like this (FPS RPGs like Skyrim and Fallout 4) normally launch with a boatload of issues. I agree that this game could have used a few more months of development, but I fail to see how it should be taken off of stores and such. Anyway I hope to see some updates in the future and maybe we'll see some of the things I've listed in the cons section get added in patches or DLC. I wish the developers the best of luck and hope they stand to make a profit and whoever decided this game needed to be pushed out of the door should be severely reprimanded. Thanks for keeping me thoroughly entertained over the holidays CDPR!"
1609726591,"Play the game and see for yourself. If you want a next gen game, buy a next gen gaming system/PC. I have 25 hours into this game and have only noticed very minor glitches from time to time. Keep in mind this is a new game with a whole new engine. You can't compare GTA to Cyberpunk because GTA has had plenty of time to work out kinks and bugs through a multitude of released games. This game is by far one of the best games I have ever played. Give it time and it will run even smoother and be more optimized."

1609726338,"Breat game 4 out of 5
"
1609726315,"Summed up, a beautiful, relatively buggy, great, massive FPS RPG with that classic CDPR ""holy shit there's so much to do"" feel. I genuinely enjoyed the main story, most of the side content, and never came across a game breaking bug.
Every build, in my experience, is entirely viable. Want to be the skulking, overly-analytical netrunner that can take over security systems and fry a person's brain with their own? Please do. How about a cyber ninja with a wall-penetrating sniper rifle? Go right on ahead. Mechanically and narratively speaking, there really is so much to explore both in the world and your own character's development.
If you have the rig for it, I really do recommend giving the game a try. Play it for the cool story, the great world-building, the decent combat, and of course Keanu's example of a non-gimmicky, genuinely impactful performance by a well-known actor in a video game."
1609726256,"terrible, (not the bugs actual game is trash) wish I refunded when I could"
1609726254,"fun and open world, yes I like good game"
1609726094,"Cyberpunk 2077 is hard to recommend at full price. Even if you have a high end system and don't have to deal with too many graphical glitches or bugs, the gameplay and environment are too extremely lacking in features to hold immersion in place. Coming from someone who has played many open world RPGs, this just feels so incomplete and empty. I'm not in the crowd that wants this to be another GTA, Skyrim, Mass Effect, or Witcher 3, but it could have at least included some of the BASIC non-unique features that those games have, or fleshed out the ones it does include. Here are some of my  immersion-breaking observations about this game:

[list]
[*]Character creation is just ""choose your body part from this set list"", doesn't include other male/female body types, and doesn't feature sliders
[*]After starting your game, you can't alter your character's appearance outside of the limited cybernetic modifications (that only change how your arms/hands look)
[*]Enemy AI is some of the worst I've ever seen. Enemy police spawn out of thin air (even in the most remote of places)
[*]Citizen NPC AI is lifeless - the moment you make any aggressive move or accidentally bump into them, they permanently cower in fear until you are far enough away from the area
[*]You will see the same NPC model over and over again on a five minute walk, or some will disappear/change once they exit your view
[*]The ""crafting"" and shops don't let you preview weapons or clothing (I'll give it a pass on a lack of transmog)
[*]There are too many significant looking buildings/clubs/shops that you can't interact with or don't actually exist
[*]You can't customize your vehicle or your apartment
[*]Your choices don't have any significant, lasting ramifications outside of the couple of endings you can experience
[*]The CORPO life-path isn't very immersive outside of the intro mission because your character pretty much [spoiler] lives their life as a Street Kid turned kinda Nomad throughout the game [/spoiler]
[/list]

The list is longer than this, but you should already get the picture. I was seriously disappointed with this game. I was initially enthralled by the intro/early missions, but once I got into the meat of the game, I noticed that there was barely any."
1609725986,Relic malfunction detected
1609725907,"We all know this game is buggy, but it doesn't detract from the sheer awesome graphics, storyline, and playability of this game.  I would highly recommend buying this unless you are on console."
1609725897,"Yes there are bugs and the game is not perfect. But the story telling, world building, and narrative is very well done. The characters (in the main story) are well done and have real, emotional interactions. For what it is, its fine."
1609725867,"Despite all the negative press and complaints, I've played through this game twice now and had a ton of fun doing so. The voice acting is top notch, the characters are all memorable and fun to interact with. If CDPR's track record is followed, this game should get some massive content upgrades over its lifetime, and I am genuinely excited for them."
1609725847,Garbage
1609725709,"Dont trust the internet, try it yourself.

If you look past the glitches and bugs then you have a pretty good game at the moment, not great, but pretty good. The main and sidequests have great storylines and sometimes some feels as well but there are only a few of these in between the mindless gigs and side missions that you get.

1609724378,"It's a good game, gets you hooked, there is some grind, but the main quests really shine and make you feel like a badass. I just wish they would of kept how the game really was supposed to have been according to older videos. In some cases it seems like they just edited out a bunch of shit to make the game more streamline, but in the process just ""F"" the whole thing. What drew people to it in all reality was all the cool small shit that other games provide without batting an eye."
1609724376,I feel bad for people that weren't able to enjoy this game on console because I found it to be fantastic. From driving around night city to discovering some of the most random weapons. I truly enjoyed the time I sank into the game and will definitely go back when dlc and even expansions are released.
1609724374,"Not a perfect game. By. Far. But for those willing to give it a chance - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised after all the hate/negative press. The world is phenomenal, Night City, a true marvel to behold. So far quests have been varied with CDPR typically unafraid to broach dark subject matter or kill off a character. Gun play is better than expected, weightier, and hacking enemies is a lot of fun, especially at higher intelligence levels. Nothing like making a 'bad' guy off himself with his own gun. However, there is that old issue of becoming overpowered for the Main Quest by completing too many side quests, so I def recommend bumping up the difficulty level and just taking your time with things. Do a little of this, a little of that. After the debris of disappointment clears from the rubble of unrealistically high expectations, this is a really good game. Just know what you're getting into before you buy it."
1609724258,Pretty good
1609724203,"It's not done yet, it's rough around the edges, but if you play it with the idea that it's a character driven RPG you're going to like it a lot.  I can't wait to see how the game progresses, all I ask is more Aldecaldos content - I've never cared so much about a virtual jacket in my life."

1609723859,Finished the main storyline for Cyberpunk 2077.  Very disappointing.  Game did not live up to the hype at all IMO.  A poor copy of other games that do everything Cyberpunk does but 1000x better.  Save your money on this one or wait till a 50% off sale. Final Score 2/5
1609723840,not bad. sometimes even great.
1609723775,"Let me get straight to the point. Everyone already knows about all the hype that was surrounding the launch of this game. Did it deliver? No, definitely not. But is it a good game? Yes, actually. Though the game is filled with mind-boggling glitches, unfinished mechanics/features, and really questionable design decisions, this is still a game with a good story and very compelling characters. The gameplay, though janky and sometimes broken, can still be quite enjoyable (when everything is working) and the game sure gives you a lot of choices in build making and how you can tackle certain missions. Its graphics are no short of marvelous and it’s got a decently high amount of content. The problem is that not all of the content is necessarily good. The game has a lot of the filler kind of side-content you’d expect from a Ubisoft game and there isn't really much to do outside of missions. The police chases, mini-games, and customization of games like Grand Theft Auto V are nowhere to be found here. You can't even customize your haircut after you're out of the character creation screen, and for a game with so many sexual themes, there is a grand total of only four proper romance options, two for each sex. Whether I can recommend this game right now depends on one thing. Have you played a Bethesda game before? Jokes aside, your tolerance for glitches and other things of that kind will highly impact whether you can enjoy the game or not. If that kinda stuff does bother you, you should definitely put this game on hold until most of its issues are fixed, which is something that will definitely happen. Though don’t ever expect it to exceed the hype. Even without the bugs, there are still a lot of more fundamental things preventing it from becoming the masterpiece everyone was expecting it to be. Just enjoy the game for what it is and don’t think much of it."
1609723734,decent game
1609723665,"Review is subject to change.

I am at the time of this review 34,5 hours into this game, I am nearing the end of the main story and I have done some sidejobs on the way, and I still have a truckload of content left. I estimate around 60-70 hours for each playthrough.

I like it, the city is immersive and stunningly beautiful to look at. Vehicles are fleshed out and filled with details. All in all, in terms of visual detail this game has it all. 

Combat is good enough, It ain't anything special, but it ain't bad either I guess. The customization provided by cyberware is all in all pretty cool. 

Just like The Witcher the strengths of CDPR isn't really gameplay. The gameplay is allround pretty good, but it isn't special. What makes this game good and worth playing is the characters, quests and visual storytelling that you will immerse you completely into the world of V and Johnny Silverhand in Night City and the areas around it. In that aspect this game is very, very good, and if you are like me and storytelling and immersion is valued higher than extremely good gameplay you will have a marvelous time playing this game. 

Bugs: Haven't had too many bad experiences really, compared to a bethesda launch this has actually been pretty smooth. I have had to reload about 6 times in 34 hours because of things like getting stuck or visual bugs in the interface. I fortunately have a habit of saving alot and therefore really never had to replay anything to get back to where I was. NPC's are weird at times and phonecalls from questgivers may interrupt important dialogue, and that is just about it in my experience. I think that CDPR did themselves a great disservice in releasing the game in this state, as it was not polished enough at all, but it still isn't bad enough to warrant a bad review considering the rest of the game.

1609723652,I found the game-play to be fun and enjoyable but the current state of the game is unstable and buggy.
1609723648,"DOOR [LOCKED]
CONTENT [MISSING]
QA [NONE]"
1609725225,"I'd relate this game to a super hero open world style game. There's a main story line, some unique side story lines, small quick quests to grind experience, and repetitive random encounters to make the city feel more alive. Where this game shines for me is unique, albeit dark, content and side character backstories. I won't spoil anything, I'll just say there were many times I caught myself thinking, ""that's the first time I've seen that in a video game"".

One of the games greatest strengths is also its biggest weaknesses. Performance. Playing on PC I didn't notice too many issues and there were many times I felt like I was one of thousands in a bustling city. The graphics were cutting edge in my opinion. It's no wonder this game toasted those potatoes I mean Xboxs and Playstations. Like all CD Project Red games in my opinion, the controls feel somewhat clunky and slow. Maybe I've just gotten too used to the speed and smoothness of CoD: Warzone though. Driving a car took some getting used to, however I was pleasantly surprised at how natural riding a motorcycle in 1st person felt. In terms of game mechanics there is a lot of strategy to explore in each skill line. Also the limited trait points you get in a single play through offers some replay value for those so inclined. 

There are a variety of ways to play the game: stealth, cybernetic samurai, super hacker, boxer style melee, or the fan favorite... gunslinger. With only a few quests forcing you into direct combat with bosses I don't think you can go wrong with any. I myself went with the hacker skill line and found ample content and strategies to play through the game. If you're looking for an Elder Scrolls this game doesn't scratch that itch for me. Now that I've finished the play worthy side plots and main quest line, I'm finding myself struggling to keep playing. Where as for me games like Elder Scrolls and GTA had a lot of reasons to keep exploring. That being said, it's the closest I've seen that wasn't Bethesda or Rockstar Games. 

Overall the game delivers in my opinion. You won't be disappointed. Considering the graphics level and scale of this game, I'm willing to cut the developers some slack when it comes to subtle annoyances and minor bugs. There wasn't anything a quick reload didn't solve. Save often and you'll be fine. Sitting on the other side of 130+ hours, I'd buy this game again. I'm excited to see some of that new content CD Projekt Red is so famously known for. I noticed their trait line has one additional unused branch in their menu design. Hopefully hinting at a new skill line for an expansion! Vive la Johnny Silverhand!"
1609723544,"This game is a colossal disappointment. Its systems are all old news stuff from older games, its unpolished and clunky, and half of its features are not implemented properly.

I wanted it to be good so bad, but the more I play the more I begin to resent it. Its a total sham, none of your choices matter, 99% of the missions are ""go here and kill everyone"" and the endings are almost universally dour .

Your lifepath, which is mega hyped, is 15 mins and effects essentially nothing. No matter what you do, how you choose or play, you MUST reach their linear end mission path. People complained about ME3 but this is RIDICULOUS

The combat is dated and the AI are unacceptable. Frankly, its a polished turd. As I played, I imagined man, maybe there is an incredible game in here and they got rush. But the longer I played, the more I realized all the time in the world would not have fixed this. It is executed so poorly, and that failure is so fundamental to its DNA.......I cannot even see a fix.

"
1609723528,"Alright, after a bit of musing I have decided the 3 biggest things wrong with Cyberpunk, imho.  Huge spoilers, you've been warned.
1.  The driving.  There's nothing intuitive, exciting, or any customization of vehicles, you just... move.  And you move poorly, there's no direct driver feel, no vehicle performance mods, no paint selections, and all the cars drive the same.  Motorcycles are the same way and i'm guessing flying vehicles (when they are released)  will be no different.

2. The immersion is too superficial.  In ads, in art books, in the website itself, it showed a world where individual customization and creativity were king.  Enter the character creation and you get nothing, hope you like your specific body type to be 1% body fat with glorious abs.  Even though you eat like shit, drink heavily, and party with your best pal, your body is gorgeous bc who wants to be heavyset and ugly in the future?  Forget the fact that individuals have different tastes, biology, or genetic background and let's throw in some jokes about the fat black guy you'll be working for, bc he's a big fat black guy.  There's no facial tech upgrades that change your appearance, no surgical changes that happen when you visit a ripperdoc, it's all surface and nothing intricate about your personal choices.  Same for your character interests and personality, even when you pick your trait points, they don't customize how you talk or act.  But hey, the shirts are cool!

3.  The story kills your character bc Keanu is an edgelord.  My caveat on this is that Keanu Reeves is fucking amazing in this role, he plays the anti hero, dystopian, angry guy amazingly well.  No one, no one, wants to be tied to another personality in an rpg where you are supposed to be able to customize and create your own character.  It'd be like playing tabletop Cypberpunk and halfway through the campaign, the DM takes control of 50% of all of your story decisions, you are required to play your character as part of another's story/personality.  Having played and run games with interesting twists, this would be cool for one of your characters to go through, if you were game to the challenge.  However, by pigeonholing your story to this arc, you are forced to play into a Keanu character's story, every single playthrough.  This kills replay-ability, kills your wanting to create your own character (it's going to have to be part of Keanu, no matter what!), and kills any twists that you could create on your own by joining gangs, corps, or reputation.  All of your rpg npcs only respond on how to help you with your digital mutliple personality, rather than to your individual choices or failures/successes.  The Keanu arc, kills the idea that you are playing anything diffferent than any other person playing this game and that kills any idea of individuality CDPR could have built into this rpg.
  It's a glorious, beautiful, and dystopian, CDPR did great things with city layout, side character development, and story building. There's just nothing individual about it, it's like playing an rpg from the SNES years, you have most of your path set out for you.  I don't care about how many story endings you have, it's about the individual journey. Another year in development and this game could have changed the entire industry."

1609723506,"On my high-end RTX enabled rig, this game is marvelous. I'm 80 hrs. in and that is mainly just side missions. Yes, it has bugs, but for me, they have been exploitable and fun. It does not crash for me, runs smoothly with everything at Ultra/High including Raytracing although, I do utilize DLSS quality to smooth out the FPS. At 1440p I get anywhere from 46FPS to above 60FPS on average. At first I was meh, but after finding out how to craft, how to gain the Iconic items, how to build up my character and doing a ton of side missions, I realize what a good experience CP2077 can be. My condolences to console players, I know it has sucked for you.  ;) Regards... #PCMRFTW"
1609723353,"This is honestly the worst overhyped game I have ever played. To go from Witcher 3 to this?? 4 Hours of dialogue to shoot a gun twice. I mean an RPG I get, but this is worse than one of those tell-tale ""games"". Basically a movie with a controller."
1609723337,IT GOOD
1609723240,"Everyone is kinda shitting on this game bcs of some of the glitches and stuff, but tbh im rlly liking this game a lot"
1609819188,"Yes, IF IT IS ON SALE AND =< 30$. As is, NO.

Its passable, its a scattershot of quality. I don't think it was worth the 60$ i spent on it. I honestly spent a ton of my time taking photos with the built in photo-mode and making an irreverent tourist of my character. Combat in-game is okay, watch dogs 1&2 was a lot more engaging in its mechanics imho, but cyberpunk 2077 at least outshines in its character casting and has better melee options. Tons of game breaking bugs around the city you can find, i'd wait until mid-2020 for more patches before buying this thing.

all in all, 7/10"
1609723170,"Over all this game has a VERY rough start. I have a new and pretty top tier PC and it runs great.....not at 8k, at a normal 1080P. It's got its got its fair share of bugs and needs a ton more polish which is sad considering how long the product took, but development hell and all that is nothing new. 

The good:
The game its self is pretty fun, a good story; interesting world building and characters that feel pretty real and can connect with. This really plays off of the classic CyberPunk feel of ultra capitalism and the almost hokey feel that's really tongue and cheek feel of the world which i love. The self aware comedy that's also played completely straight  is a really love or hate writing style; i happen to love it. Over all IMO the game outshines its shortcomings. Most of the  game play mechanics feel rewarding and enjoyable like melee and hacking.

The Bad:
well...will it run? This game doesn't look good if its being run on medium/medium high settings; if thats not your gig then you will probably not like it; its really hard to run at high/ultra. The bugs can be a real killer. I have not had any game breaking bugs but i have had some bugs that have killed me or caused my re-start a mission; and resurrecting the dead. The gun play is really loose and feels like it has zero impact and guns are weightless, its not a good feeling.


I've been enjoying the game and over all i think its a 7/10 game. not GOTY level but enjoyable."
1609723166,yes
1609723038,"Excellent Game, Need a decent rig to run it though, so keep that in mind before purchasing."
1609722941,"Awesome game and can't get enough of it. If you have a good gaming rig with good hardware, you will have minimal bugs and a great experience. If your system is somewhat outdated, you will experience more bugs and issues, and it might even break the experience for you.

The game is great overall and if you really pay attention to the details, you will see that they indeed spent a good amount of time, effort, love, and thought into this game. Now, if you would take into account that this game took 8 years to make... then... they did a pretty bad job. Even considering the smaller size of CDPR in comparison to something like Rockstar, the game should have received a WAY larger budget and larger team to develop it to match the hype, OR, less hype around it. Honestly, the biggest mistake was to ever put a date on the game and rush the launch... Unfortunate.

Regardless, I personally love it and I look forward to seeing the game being polished further over time."
1609722940,"Its a pretty good game for me, the only major glitch i ran into was the loss of all traffic hitboxes for about 5 seconds"
1609722746,Best Story line I have been through in a decade.
1609722718,"I love the Witcher 3 game that these devs did. They did a great job on this game too,
but I just feel like the sexual content is pushed waayy too much.
I had to stop playing it, cause of this reason, and really didn't want to stop playing the game. It uninstalled now, and I won't play it anymore. If they do come out with another witcher game, I'll end up getting that."
1609722521,"As someone who played the original Cyberpunk 2020 tabletop roleplaying game, the number of Easter eggs and nods to the original is something that is an absolute delight to me. Combat is acceptable, with each weapon having it's own feel, and gunning everything down -NOT- being the only option. Crafting is a bit slow, especially considering how quickly you level in Street Cred and character level. The stealth aspects, and especially the ""Netrunning"" are very enjoyable, if a bit repetitive. The vehicle driving (if not using a controller) is absolutely -horrible-, though they do a great job giving each vehicle it's own unique feel.

The real gem here is the storytelling. The stories you find through the quests (gigs and jobs) more than make up for the occasionally repetitive feeling of combat, especially with all the nods to the things that shape the overall idea of ""Cyberpunk"" (the Akira-based motorcycle, the dystopian yet uncomfortably accurate view of the corporate future, the nods to the darker nature of humanity and technology, etc). You'll find all kinds of little delights (I swear to gawd, I had a rando NPC cursing the developers for making something unbeatable) and nods to pop culture, both current and long-past (Russian guy killing some random dude's dog and stealing his car, only to realize he dun f*cked up? Check).

Master the combat, then sit back and enjoy the sheer depth of work that was put into the actual storytelling. That is where the game shines. Returning fans of the original tabletop game? All the wonderful stories shared in the book are continued here. Enjoy the ride, choom."
1609722489,"After clearing all the side quests markers, majority of the NCPD stuff and multiple ending.  I have to say this is no Witcher 3 but it doesnt leave me with the feeling that it should've or could've been more after I beat Witcher 2.  This is game is very ambitious when it comes to the scale of NPCs and stuffs happening in Night City therefore it has a lot of graphical, audio bugs associated with the game which will probably gets fixed or the modding community will improve it.  This game is a solid 9/10 and when I come back in a few month after the modders do their things it will probably be 10/10.  Storyline, graphic, music it's all in the game just Immerse yourself probably will have a blast like me.  FYI I went through the game as blade wielding corpo hacker had a blast will do it again."
1609722471,<3
1609722418,"I had a great time. Most of the random side missions were very memorable. Hustles felt like a filler activity and the only real way to make money, which is not needed unless you are trying to buy all of the cars, in which, also sell everything as you go. Gameplay was fun. I did not encounter many bugs while playing. The few that I did were fixed by saving and reloading. The endings were okay. Only two of the seven felt satisfying, which is a bit disappointing. I only crashed 3-5 times while playing on a PC that did not meet the minimum requirements to play this game. I do not regret paying full price for this game."
1609722326,"Definitly one of the best games 2020.
I had some bugs sure but it was more fun then annoying.
The game is just beautiful if u have a good PC,the story is good,the sidequest are really good and just the Open World is insane,i love it"
1609722314,I really recommend this game to people who love sci-fi! I watched Blade Runner and read 1984 a few months before the game's release and I love the atmospheric vibe that Night City gives off. There are a few visual gltiches but they are nothing you would notice unless you were really paying attention. Overall I rate this game a 9/10.
1609722243,"Gunplay feels horrible. Melee feels horrible. Boss fights feels horrible. Quickhacks feels horrible. Car chases feels horrible. Tanks feels horrible. Leveling, perks and gear feels horrible. Story is forgettable. The world is superficial and has zero depth. BUT, it is slightly enjoyable nonetheless. 115 hours played. I regret wasting so much time on a game with such bad gameplay but... meh... Will play the sequel three weeks AFTER launch. Never preordering shit again."
1609722207,Pretty buggy right now (1/3/21) but still an excellent game with an amazing story.
1609722188,"Garboni A.I. and buggy, but it's still fun and story is amazing. I suggest buying the game in a few months when everything is fixed."
1609722157,Buggy as you could imagine
1609722137,"So many people are quick to hop on the hate train for this game. I do agree that the corporate executives of CDPR should have waited to release this game at least another couple months. From what I understand many of those on the development team are pissed off at upper management for rushing this game out before it was polished.

That being said, to say that this game is 'bad' because of low performance on last gen is wrong in my book. Improvements will be made I'm sure. I always judge games by four main categories: gameplay, graphics/performance, atmosphere, and story. This game has awesome gameplay, incredible graphics (if playing on higher end hardware), a uniquely rich atmosphere, and from what I have played so far- an interesting and engaging story.  Glitches do abound currently, but considering that this game is less than a month old, I assume many of the issues will be corrected.

I'm not happy with how the executives choose to release this game, but sadly it seems that this is the world of gaming we live in these days. Where products get rushed out half-baked, to please investors. I do not know the whole story to why this game was rushed at release, but in any case it was the wrong decision.

This game is great so far, and I'm happy to continue to play it."
1609722109,its nice! My health is now stuck at 0 and im invinsible?
1609722044,It's good
1609722038,It's great. I dont wanna type a huge review but after 130+ hours it a great rpg. story is awesome.
1609722016,"You like exploring games, doing side missions, to see what else other than the story the game offers, then I will recommend this game. Had tons of fun!"
1609721913,"Complete disappointment from CDPR.

I completely understand the issues around glitches at launch, but what has really frustrated me is the amount of content that was taken out which remains in most of the marketed videos on their YouTube channel. 
‘TwoDynamic’ created a great video showcasing what was removed and the sources for them. 

For me, with a city that showcases so many different areas of life, It’s completely irritating that you as a player cannot represent that through your character. For example:

Unable to:
Customise/mod vehicles (Look at video: Cyberpunk 2077 — Rides of the Dark Future)
Customise your character after creation. 
Customize your weapons visually. 
Clothing and armour is completely random with no options to save outfits or even preview before purchasing them from a shop. A basic 6 item system, unable to add extra details or colour.  The NPCs have better clothes than you. 

The driving in this is the worst, The brakes don’t work on any car, you can’t do tight turns and every car has a turning radius as a 18 wheeler, including motorcycles.

This is only few of the many issues. The game we purchased is NOT the game we were promised.

         


"
1609721861,Runs pretty well on an RTX 2080 though it's the first game that's made me need a 3080.
1609721840,"I was skeptical at first about buying this game because of all of the negative feedback, but I went ahead and bought it. Honestly, great game. Many visual bugs, but nothing too bad - some are actually quite humorous. Did have some issues with bugs where I couldn't proceed with a quest because some side character didn't get in their car or a dialogue option didn't pop up, but this was easily fixed by reloading a save. Story line is great, but a little short in my opinion. Lots of side quests to make up for it if you choose to pursue them. Character customization could be better. I wish there were more hairstyles for female V and a 𝓵𝓪𝓻𝓰𝓮𝓻 variety of genitalia selections. All in all good game, but definitely not polished in any way."
1609721779,Yes

1609721738,เกมสนุกมากถึงบัคจะเยอะไปบ้างในสวนของเนื้อเรื่องดีงามมากๆๆ
1609721727,"lovely
"
1609769510,"While I loved this game and do ultimately recommend it, I want to stress that this game is quite flawed, even if we ignore the bugs. So depending on what you're looking for, it might not be for you. That's why I'm gonna start with the negatives.

[h1][u] THE BAD [/u][/h1]

Most of the game itself is pretty mediocre (as both an open world game and as an RPG). After you get over the incredibly detailed environments and how beautiful the game is, you realize that there's very few ways to interact with the world. Ultimately, Night City feels like a hub for you to choose your next mission in rather than a place your character actually lives. 

The game also feels unfocused and half-baked at times. It wants to be an RPG, while also wanting to be an open world action adventure, while also wanting to be a looter shooter, while also wanting to be an immersive sim, and ends up not fully delivering on any of it. All of those aspects are just barely passable, and it doesn't excel in any of them.

This game's also probably got some of the worst driving I've experienced in an open world game. I played with kb+m along with a controller on hand specifically for driving, but it's really bad even with a controller. Some cars/bikes do handle better than others though.

A lot of the mission design is pretty unimaginative (aside from some exceptions). Some missions feel like they were on a third or fourth draft and were supposed to have more added to them with how underwhelming and sparse those missions felt. 

Finally, there's also a lot of little annoying things like the mini-map is zoomed in way too much to be useful while driving, NPCs during missions move at a snail's pace and the game makes you follow them or wait for them way too many times, the UI is clunky, the system for purchasing vehicles is insanity, and a bunch of other tiny problems that will annoy you overtime. 

[h1][u] THE GOOD [/u][/h1]

[b] PRESENTATION [/b]

The game is really gorgeous and has extremely detailed environments. Night City is probably one of the best designed open world maps from a visual perspective. Each district feels distinct with its own culture and class. If you just want to sight-see, there's a lot of cool things to find. The city looks lived in and can feel real at times (as long as you don't stare at the NPCs or cars for too long and try not to interact with anything in a slightly unusual way). The music and soundtrack is also incredible. All the radio stations are amazing - great enough to make the terrible driving bearable - and the game music is also great. 

[b] QUICKHACKS/BREACHES [/b]

While I don't think the hacks quite reach their potential, I do think that they are implemented in an interesting way that should have been more expanded on. There's a decent variety of hacks that can help you approach an encounter in different ways. 

The breaching minigame is one of the best ways a game has handled hacking. Usually hacking minigames are either mind-numbing or a chore, but in Cyberpunk it's just engaging enough to not be boring, while also not being annoyingly difficult. The breaching will have you making decisions at times about what type of breach you want to prioritize (which had [i] so [/i] much potential for more interesting high-stakes situations if they took advantage of it), and chaining together breaches and quick-hacks never gets old. It feels satisfying when you hit all the breaches in one go, or you chain quick-hacks to electrocute someone then blow their brains out. Damaging an enemy and then immediately taking them out of combat mode through quickhacks is also hilarious. I just wish it was more expanded on, because the groundwork they have here is really interesting. 


[b] STORY/CHARACTERS/SIDE MISSIONS [/b]

What really saves this game for me is the story, the characters, and the varied situations the game puts V through. Basically if it weren't for the writing, I would have stopped playing this halfway through (because from a mechanics or systems perspective the game is mediocre, or passable at the very best). All of the characters are incredibly well defined, there's really cool situations you get to be part of (in both the main story and side jobs). And they'll vary in tone from thrilling to hilarious to heartfelt, but it all feels cohesive. 

Oddly enough I never feel immersed while just exploring the map on my own, but it's in these scripted side and main missions (where you learn more about a character, experience something wacky, get involved with an aspect of the city you didn't know about, or meet someone new) where Night City truly starts to feel alive. 

Is it bad that the scripted moments were far more immersive and enjoyable than the non-scripted ones? idk. Basically I liked the writing for all the missions (and side-jobs) but was really underwhelmed by the open world and the RPG/immersive sim aspects. 

[h1][u] TL;DR [/u][/h1]
If you're looking to play an amazing open world action adventure or a deep RPG, you might be disappointed. If you'll be satisfied with a more scripted game with excellent characters and writing while having passable combat that provides *just* enough options for you to not want to stop playing, this game's for you. I absolutely loved the world building and the stories, and those were enough for me."

1609721274,"Sooooooo. i'll go ahead and start my final verdict on the game. I am fully sure someone has heard something about this game from some source (mostly negative) as did i, however upon playing 65 hours now i've come to a conclusion..... it is a good game there is no mistaking that was it rushed?? yes most definitely and it should have had more dev time but that does not mean its bad because of a few bugs. I agree companies need to stop releasing games before their finished and just fix it through patches that's lazy on the company its share holders and its just an all around shit move."
1609721230,Don't buy this game rn. I think it's honestly the buggiest game i have ever played. If you insist on playing rn then be ready to be disappointed.

1609721019,Trailers lie about everything.
1609720981,Good story and nice side quests. Better than any other AAA at this time!
1609720942,"I'm having allot of fun. Love the characters and the story and the game play. There are a few caveats. First be realistic about your hardware. Despite what some have said this is a next gen game. accept it and move on. You will have to make some considerations if you're on 2 gen old hardware like me. I'm using a gtx 1060 3 gig and it runs just fine getting 50 to 60 fps most of the time dipping to 30 at some points, rather infrequently. How did i do that. By being ralistic. I'm running at 720p on high but with crowd density on low. few other things like like no film grain and no motion blur or blur on low. Other than that looks and runs great and is a ton of fun. One more thing it's very easy to be OP so if that's not your thing set your options accordingly."
1609720909,"it's been a fun game despite the glitches, through patches etc I am sure the game will get better."
1609720873,Fun.
1609720847,"Plenty to do , didnt get a lot of bug....so far....im running on a 2 year old PC , i have to say my fps is jumping up and down here and therr from 30~50 fps.
Mainly Story driven game"
1609720786,"Most people are cry babies when it comes to the bugs, don't get me wrong it does have a number of bugs. In  my 40 hours I did not run into in game breaking bugs. Great story and great game play."
1609720671,this game needs to be in early access. i cant play for more than an hour without some bug annoying me so then i just quit the game. its HORRIBLE
1609720568,"Buggy, glitch-filled, and under-baked, I still am enjoying this game. The customizable character has their own personality that seems very familiar to Geralt from the Witcher series, something that is obvious afterward and adds some great depth, but is unique in the genre and for the level of choices made. The story could have used an extra polishing pass, but is enjoyable. I feel that the game should be taken as the first buggy step into a new franchise rather than as a polished and perfected game. I'm certainly enjoying the ride."
1609720688,"I had little expectations for 2077 since I didn't jump on the hype train with everyone else back in 2013.

But wow, was I still let down so immensely. 

The game promised a never before seen open world with choices that changed the entire game. 
What I got was a semi-open world with choices that mattered for a total of 10 minutes, bugs that seem to never cease, and a game that sucks the ever living soul out of my GPU for no apparent reason.

-Game play choices, they're completely insignificant and within 10-20 minutes of the game what starting path you chose is completely irrelevant. Congratulations, now you're scum just like the rest of us. The choices or bonds you forge through the game seem to matter very little until the very end. There's no bonus interactions with some of my favorite side characters after you complete their story line. You can call them, cool.. now you hang up on them and now there is absolutely no interaction with them.
The ending choices, while interesting were nothing to write home about. They gave you these huge cliff hangers or just something that left you feeling lost... like ""That's really the end?""

-The bugs, I won't speak on them. Everyone else has, there's memes. Everyone knows this is one of the buggiest games to be released by a AAA company in years.

-Itemization, it's poor. You'd get this really really really kick ass piece of clothing and you're like ""That's my character and I really want them to sport that the rest of the game"" only for it to be outclassed by another piece of armor withing 2-4 levels because if you don't pour every single point into crafting you won't have enough materials or even skill to upgrade your favorite jacket, sword, etc.. 

-Replayability, I 100% the game my first playthrough. I was consumed in finishing every single side quest and making sure every loose end was closed before I walked into the final mission. And even still I started a second play through just to find out that it's the exact same game with the exact same copy and paste missions from any other story line you'd choose.

-Last thing I will speak on is the driving, I had heard and read multiple times that the driving in this game was to rival that of GTA V. Cool! I couldn't wait to hop in my first car in Night City, and after I did. I was all but let down. The driving feels like even if I'm on a motorcycle? I'm steering a bus. The driving physics also make little to no sense, as to why a motorcycle can plow into a car going 115 mph and I flip them over and they go flying and I just cruise on by without a scratch or like nothing ever happened? 

-I'm not very good at writing reviews, but I did but a lot of time and effort into this game. And I REALLY want to recommend this game, but honestly? I can't. And I won't until it's better.
I know the fans were pushy, and I hope they enjoyed the half baked game they were delivered because this was partially on them.

-In summary, the game has SO much potential. And I'd love to see it improved upon. But at this point you'd have to gut half of the systems in the game just to make it as fun as can be. 
I'll hold out hope, but I don't see it happening.

4/10, would not recommend the game at this point."
1609720449,Yes
1609720262,"[b]Disappointing, I would NOT recommend the game in its current state. [/b]
Buggy and broken most of the time. 
Outside of the scripted missions there isn't really much to do other than repeating the same; ""go there, kill everyone, loot, move on"" tasks, occasionally there is a cool side mission like the ones for Johnny or some of the cyberpsycho tasks but most end up the same. 
No rep systems so can't join gangs, cops or tribes etc. 
All the loot is worthless because its either a minor upgrade or scrap. None of the weapons or implants, even the iconic weapons, are interesting or super cool. 
Hacking and stealth feel under developed and just there so you can kill a few guys before alerting the enemies and mowing everyone else down anyway.
Factions don't matter and you end up forced into the same story line regardless resulting in a several minute montage of all the cool things you and Jackie do meaning all emotional attachment to him is reliant on a none interactive video of things you did together resulting in me really not giving a flying fk when he gets killed. 

The game feels rushed. There is clearly a lot of missing content and features that should be there and maybe they will add them eventually. Sad that the the greed, ironically of corporate seniors who clearly wanted to rush the game out for Christmas, resulted in a quite frankly boring and broken game."
1609720075,loved the game  yeah there are alot of bugs but the game is still playable and enjoyable
1609720036,"Although it has it's bugs here and there, i never let that stop me. Reminds me of all the fallout games. Hopefully over time some of the bugs get patched. I'll never expect the game to run 100% bug free but It hasn't impacted my performance and I've enjoyed my time so far"
1609720037,"[h1]A thing of beauty, I know, will never fade away[/h1]

I'll quickly skim through the glaring issues as you have surely read about them in great detail by now. The driving is bad unless you are literally using the most expensive car the game has to offer, there are a ton of bugs, the NPC AI is not up to modern standard and a lot of depth that was promised has not been delivered. With that out of the way, why do I still recommend playing this game?

Out of the 119.1 hours(according to Steam) it took me to finish my play through, I have not had a single moment where I thought the writing of the main and side quests is not a masterpiece. While a lot of the game feels unpolished, the stories and characters Night City has to offer truly show that CDPR has met their ambitious goal in at least one department. 

Of course the most outstanding part of it all is the duality between V and Johnny Silverhand that absolutely sucks you into the world of Cyberpunk and really immerses you, if a bug is not currently ruining that of course. 


Is this the magnum opus of video game history? Nah, choom. What you are getting is a game that plays great at best and barely at the worst wrapped in story writing and character development that should set a new standard for years to come."
1609719914,"This was just an awesome game, nothing else to say. Easily my top 3 just after RDR2 and Witcher 3."

1609719766,"i shat myself
"
1609719764,10/10
1609719742,An amazing game. Sure it has bugs and issues but this one will be one to hold onto for the future for sure. The world feels alive and there is always something going on in Night City.
1609719696,"The console versions suck. 

The PC version is stable, and really fun. I was able to run it at a stable 70-80 FPS on Ultra at 1080p. I only encountered one crash the entire game, in 100 hours. A few minor bugs here and there but nothing game breaking.

The story is engaging, and well written. Some of the side quests (the guy running for mayor) are absolute stand outs.

Give it a try"
1609720257,"This review will be ignoring the obvious visual bugs and npc issues with this game. That might be fixed eventually.

This game has a few issues that never will be fixed with patches.
The main story is too short. I'm not saying I feel cheated because I ""only"" got 20 hours of entertainment out of the games main story.

The issue is that the story literally ends too fast for it to come to a good conclusion.

If you think about it like a movie, the game has one good act, the first one. But even the first act suffers from lack of storytelling (which it ironically instead shows in a montage).
The later acts are just not good at telling the story of the world because the story elements were probably cut.
The character development through side quests is good, but I would gladly trade away some of the side quests for a more fleshed out main quest. Less Johnny Silverhand, more Cyberpunk.

Gameplay wise this shows in large city areas feeling abandoned because they were most likely scrapped in development.
For example the city of Pacifica is built up story wise like a big new chapter but houses one single quest.

When I finally got to the end I literally thought I made something wrong, that I somehow managed to tick all the boxes for the worst ending that cut the story in half."
1609719455,"A truly amazing experience spanning into the realms of RPG, Action, Open World, FPS ... This game is the Love Triangle of games offspring.... part Borderlands....part Deux Ex..... part GTA....with a lil the Division as a side Bitzch and some 2077 Space Weed to get us really going.... all games these days have cool intros....but this one goes down in my Top 3 all time.... WOW is all I can say...."
1609719448,fire nails
1609719389,At least i didn't get softlocked in an elevator
1609719337,"Yeah the bugs suck, they got better from the last patch though. Story is great fun, and quite immersive when there isn't T-posing or cars falling from the sky. Doesn't feel super replayable, may be worth grabbing on discount, but definitely worth playing through. We've forgiven Bethesda for worse."
1609719259,"aside from the bugs and performance issues, if you CAN get around it the story is great and gameplay is fun"
1609720229,side quests are boring  only main story is fun. theres no point for stupid ncpd presence this isnt gtav. and the mini map SUCKS
1609719195,"Give the game 4 years and maybe it will be finished then. Had many visual bugs, 50+ crashes, and some story or immersion breaking glitches.
If you want to buy it, I'd estimate it to be maybe 10€ worth of game ( 20€ game - 5€ lies by CDPR - 5€ glitches and anger about glitches)."
1609719129,"still really buggy, but overall AMAZING game, you can easily get lost for multiple hour without noticing the time fly going from gigs, to side quest, to whatever you encountering, nice level up and skill system. I definitely recommand since it will  only get better with oncoming patch"
1609719069,very good on pc
1609719025,"Absolutely breathtaking! Admitedly got the game after the HotFix, so havent had to suffer through the launch bugs, but this game is fantastic! Deep and engaging story, enjoyable and new combat through the mix of guns and hacking, plus the amazing verticality of the city!"
1609719018,There are two sides: penis 01 and penis 02
1609719008,"buggy for sure but a beautifully crafted environment, deep skill system, and multiple approaches to tackle everything."
1609718725,"The glitches are kept to a minimum, and the performance was fine on my desktop.  This is my favorite I've played in a long time. Though it may not be for everyone, I think its a polished game, that's worth the cash."
1609718685,"This game is among the best I've played. It has its bugs, true, but games always do, and ones like Ark, or any Bethesda game which has been out for near a decade are still more buggy then this. the Story is perfect and has drawn me in for a few hundred hours already."
1609718587,aldecaldo moment
1609718543,"This game is very good. It's like Rising Storm 2: Vietnam, but it isn't."
1609718496,"Know what you are getting into. I can only recommend this game to some players. Mostly, the ones who are willing to trade a lot of bugs, for interesting storylines. and beautiful scenery."
1609718420,"First of all my english is not well. so I am sorry.

I HAVE A HUGE DREAM

I waited this game too much. I dont care bugs. they can be fix when the time is come. I am still  mad because of the story. I cant change anything in the city. over 1 million people play this game and all of them play same thing. So when I decide something, I want to see differrent solution then differrent result. When I choose to kill someone this decision needs to change the story or ballace of the game.

my second opinion is I want to see consequences of my reputation . when I walk to street or enter the pub . I want to hear something about me. (For example Witcher) these opinions couldnt be hard for your team. because we saw in Witcher.

At the end I have 86 hour on this game. I still like because there is to many little detail, job also huge city and ext...

-Am I recommend this game?
-Yes 

-Am I Play again?
-Yes 

-Do I want to see more?
-Absolutely

-Is this a game which to spend money?
-If you have enough money you can buy."
1609753778,"I am totally no-life'ing this game rn.
If you liked games like Skyrim, Fallout 3, GTA5 and enjoy having choices in games that change the storyline/ending then you'll most likely love Cyberpunk 2077.
I am appreciating the mature content in this game. It hasn't been since GTA5 that I've had to deal with drugs, alcohol, sex, etc.
The theme of the game is awesome. I didn't think I'd enjoy the futuristic/sci-fi world genre but it reminds me of some of my favourite movies (Dredd, MadMax, Blade Runner, Ready Player One)
The only gamble is that from what I hear, some people weren't able to enjoy the game fully due to it's intense graphics, errors, crashing or bugs. I run an RTX 2080 and I have zero problems running this game on Ultra and it looks beautiful. I'll get a CTD loading in but on a rare occasion, and it never happens back to back.
Best advice I can give is Disassemble instead of Selling and watch YouTube vids on tips, tricks, secrets."
1609717954,"200h in the game at the time of writing.
Did I enjoy the game - Yes.
I love that the game is in first person view, I don't care about cinematic cutscenes and like the game without them. I even drive and race my car in 1st person. I like the different approaches possible to completing a mission, the stealth and the hacking is pretty dope. I like how they pulled off melee combat in 1st person. The level design is awesome, and some cars are really dope. Like the police cars, the design is really unique and dope. Some times you get cool dialog options based on what you have done in the past. I like that enemies don't scale with your level, there are low level enemies in low level area and high level enemies in high level area. So you have to level up before you can do high level quests, same as Witcher 3, and I like this. I hate the games that scale with our level and make leveling pointless.
The reason I'm not recommending this game is because this game could have been much better, and a lot of content was cut. 
- Branching Story and Dialog options. I feel that Witcher 3 had better branching stories, I only played Witcher 3 only once, but it felt like my choices actually mattered and had real consequences. In Cyberpunk the side quests are very shallow and short.
- Factions. It was promised that you could start the game as a Nomad but get closer to Corps are you progress in the game. There is none of that, you're treated the same no matter your passed and there is no way to get better rep with Nomad or Corp. Would have been cool to get unique quest based on who you side with, the you could replay the game multiple times with different quest and experience are promised.
- City Environment - Visually looks really dope but shallow, It's awesome that there are no loading screen. But it's kinda lame how shallow the world is. You can climb stuff and find some un-marked stuff on the roofs and places, but at the same time most maga-building are closed off unless you have a quest in that mega-building. And there is nothing else to do there except for the quest location.
- Cars ars are cool and unique but ultimately useless. The cars you buy don't have much utility and don't help you in quest unless it's a racing quest where you have an option to use NPC's vehicle anyway. I wish there was more quests where a fast car or armored car would have been useful. Or having a 4 seat car would have some use for the seats, or being able to hide more dead bodys in a cargo van.
- Guns feel different and have different capabilities which is dope, but the loot system is kinda weak. Similar to Witcher 3 so I didn't really expect better. And I think the loot might be scaled with your level. If you're high level more enemies will drop rare loot. Even low level enemies start dropping rare loot at least it feels like it.
- Crafting is very basic and unbalanced, I think crafting some items takes less resource than you get from scrapping that item. The crafting system that I like is in Fallout 4, you change different parts of the gun to get different stats take different resources and you need a gun crafting bench for gun and armor crafting bench for armor. Basic crafting is fine the didn't promise extensive crafting.

So I stopped playing the game, wait for update, wait for them to finish building the world, open up locked out area, fill them with useful/interesting stuff and add more quests. And I feel that future quests will have more branching out paths and dialog options."
1609717913,Not even an hour in and my Gaming Laptop is hot af
1609717873,"Don't believe all the hate. The game has bugs, but it, just like The Witcher 3, is a masterpiece of RPG storytelling in a world that feels vibrant and alive. If you quicksave often, you will remove all of the game-breaking issues and be left with a few hilarious visual bugs. Night City is a new benchmark in immersive storytelling environments, it is massive and detailed like nothing before in a video game. Not only are the environments stunning, but they are well supported by the memorable characters, satisfying combat, multi-path exploration in missions, and surprisingly good RPG mechanics. Maybe wait until they patch it a time or two, but this game is definitely worth every penny of your $60. 
For a more complete review, check out the Open Betas podcast wherever you get your podcasts."
1609717836,This might be a good game in a few more... months. But the damn bugs are too much even with all the recent fixes. I'd hold off.
1609717830,This game is good fun
1609717827,"Weak, in every aspect of the game, except for graphics. 
A weak RPG, a weak shooter, a weak driving game, a weak plot. Some of the characters are good, the world is beautiful, but not much beyond this."
1609717792,cool game  it look nice
1609717748,Incredible story and world building. The best written cast of characters I have ever come across in an open-world video game.
1609717622,If you have a good up to date gaming PC it runs well.
1609717549,"Lots of fun! Minimal bugs, nothing game breaking"
1609740128,"200+ hours in, level 39 character playing on Hard - But an awful lot of which has been reloading/replaying the same missions/areas to get past game breaking bugs, just one example here and the one that made me finally decide to post a BAD review:

Being stuck in combat and unable to complete a mission/save the game because the last foe has glitched through a wall and I can't kill her with grenades, system reset/hacks, bullets or blades, but she sure as hell can shoot straight through the wall and instantly kill me multiple times.

This was so much fun reloading and replaying the same mission again and again for over 2 hours, until I finally found the only one way to do it meant I had to sneak past 14 other enemies into the area and kill her first before anyone else, because as soon as combat was initiated in any way she ALWAYS glitched through the wall.

Negatives:
Main story line makes no sense, provides a false sense of urgency, but then here's a city with  200+ sub-quests, that someone with a life threatening issue wouldn't worry about doing... maybe if half of these missions had been playable in the 'six months later' intro. I might actually feel invested in Night City the other characters/'V' - as it was I'm like, OK that was a really short boring intro. why am I here now? Why am I friends with Jackie? I mean he tried to rip me off.
The bugs, so many and so many game breaking ones forcing reload after reload.
Night city, looks great, but pretty darn boring, 99% of NPCs can't be interacted with in any meaningful way.
The NPC AI - terrible, just... terrible.
The map, the GPS keeps breaking and losing the lines/marker to see where to go and I have no way to easily navigate to locations, in a complex city that just makes the game ludicrously hard to travel around.
All the obviously cut content, NCART, etc.
The almost complete lack of any real difference in the three character backgrounds.
I could go on...

Completed probably 60% of the main story, but I'm not bothering to finish the main story line until they fix the bugs."
1609717612,"Need a bugland? Lets play CP2077. Had much more fun in 2002 Mafia II. This 'next gen' is totally not worth your money. Just watch CP vs GTA V, totally what you are going to experience. Aaaaand the music is craaaaaaaapy."
1609717462,"I don't think its a bad game. I just think its just one of those that you are either going to really enjoy or think is very boring. Unfortunately for me, I gave it about 8 hours and I never had any bugs or anything--I just really was not having much fun with it. The entire time I was playing I kept thinking that GTAV was released so long ago and just looked better, had more variance in NPCs, better AI--and at the end of that 8 hours--I reinstalled GTAV and had a lot more fun. It literally has nothing to do with the gameplay itself but just, the systems in general.

That being said, I don't think its a bad game. I just think I personally preferred other titles to get my fix and maybe one day if they get better pathing, AI, and driving mechanics I'll be back to give it a go."
1609717333,"They are way too many bugs, in 85 minutes of play, I got an invisible gun while shooting, grass visible through walls, flying cars, trembling dead body, etc ...

Don't buy the game now, wait until there is a patch to correct all those bugs."
1609717423,"I really wanted to like this game. I waited for it for 7 years. I don't know if there was actually any possible way they could've lived up to 7 year's worth of hype, but they didn't. If you have little to no expectations for this game then sure go for it I guess. You might even enjoy it if you can overlook the Bethesda-level amount of bugs, the boring open-world, the plainly average combat, and the (in my opinion) boring plot. But if you're like me and many other people who have waited for this game for a near decade then don't waste your time with it. You'll just end up severely disappointed and probably extremely pissed off. Hell even if you're not in the same boat it's not worth its $60+ price tag, just wait for it to go on sale. Actually just do yourself a bigger solid and just go play one of the many better open-world games out there, at least you won't be bored shitless playing those. The only positive thing I can say about this shell of a video game is that the graphics do look pretty good. Don't let the reviews for the PS4 and Xbox versions of the game fool you, if you have decent hardware this game looks great. It was pretty cool checking out certain spots in the world and just looking around at all the cool stuff. Well, at night anyway, daytime in-game looks like shit.

 So yeah don't buy this."
1609717298,yes
1609717106,Glitched to hell but the game still runs. 9/10
1609716865,"In my opinion THIS IS A PC GAME! No console can handle the stress of this game. Not in terms of graphics but in terms of the glitches. I am not too informed on the status of the console versions but I can say for certain you won't have as smooth of a ride as the PC version. I rock a i7-7700 and a gtx 1060 6gb and I am quite satisfied with the low settings because it can run at least. I know the game is glitchy beyond all reason but I suggest to give it time. Everyone from CD Projekt Red to us were desperate to finally see this game released. And we got what we wanted an incomplete game with potential. So don't criticize CD Projekt Red too much. At least they are trying to make things right and we are also at fault for demanding too much of them. As gamers we have EXTREMELY high expectations when it comes to games but we all have to realize people are trying to make US happy with these games so at least give them the benefit of the doubt glitches and all. I know this wasn't the game that they promised us to be but at least give them the chance to work their way toward it as they continue their efforts to fix the issues and make us happy once again. 

OVERALL: 7/10"
1609716800,Doesn't live up to the hype at all. Released the game the day of the embargo lift and come to find out the developer was being dishonest.
1609716764,"Despite technical flaws, the art direction and design aspects of this game are top-tier. Most importantly, it is just plain fun to play."
1609716691,"Even given the bugs at launch, my experience playing this game on PC has been phenomenal. I had experienced minimal bugs, mostly just visual issues, but nothing game-breaking like I've heard from players on consoles. This has probably been the best game I've played at launch since Skyrim launched. It has quickly become one of my favorites games, even given how tough it is to run this game. Highly recommended to anyone playing this on PC. All things considered, this game is well worth purchasing."
1609716691,great game far exceeded my expectations . Beautiful graphics and decent gun combat.
1609716668,10/10 LOVE IT
1609716654,"Most complaints are from console gamers. I have of this game with GTX 1070 and RTX 3070. Obviously, the new cards offer better frames and higher settings but I had no issue getting 60+ fps with the 1070 with lowered settings. If you enjoy RPG titles this is a must play."
1609716639,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
1609716634,Fantastic- huge city to explore. Lots of different playstyles possible. Character can get overpowered at high levels.
1609716556,"No doubt in my mind that this is going to be Game of the Year, despite all the negative press."
1609716453,"An Open-world when the world feels lack of....everything. The gameplay/combat is nothing fresh or new, in fact, it can be tedious and boring by the time you advance through the game.
The history in general it's mediocre, with a false conception of election all the time, only to pick your ending in a nothing but simple mission."
1609716412,I love this game! Yes there are bugs and problems with the game but the devs have shown that they will not leave them up to modders to solve. improvements are coming fast and steady. All of the core mechanics work just fine and the shooting and cover system is the best I have ever played with. It is an absolute 10/10 in my books.
1609716383,"Generally not too buggy as far as gameplay goes, but the graphics DEFINITELY bug out sometimes (trees that turn into.. ocean waves? and treelines glitching into other graphics, random black boxes, etc).  Not enough to ruin my enjoyment of the game though, but it does get irritating.  Overall though, I'm really loving the world that's been built for this.  It's my first ever FPS game so getting used to that is a challenge/change but I'm enjoying it."
1609717239,So glad this game has crafting.  And main quests too!  Details like this really make Night City feel alive.
1609716291,Glad i didnt' pre order like normal... but as of 1/3/21 with patches game works fine on pc
1609716252,its a buggy mess and really should not even be purchasable its not finished for crying out loud Sony was smart for taking it off there store but CD project reds greed to publish a unfinished game just to get more funding or overall cash is just so pathetic tricking millions of players into buying a unfinished piece of crap like there is trees sticking thru the building you first walk around and explore  and random shit like cars floating around and no not the like taxi car thingy i mean literal cars
1609716179,"Sure game is mildly disappointing compared the previous CD Project game, but the biggest crime is I was bored for most of the 30 hours it took me to finish the main story and some of the side quests that I decided to complete. I don't regret buying the game, game was buggy but had no real game breaking experiences, just felt flat, boring and uninspired in some ways. With time the game will become a lot better a fuller I'm sure, I just don't know if I will want to return. I honestly considering reinstalling Witcher 3."
1609720394,"Ok game.  
Lots of bugs. 
Cool shoot outs.
Nothing revolutionary. This game is better than Dues Ex.
Graphics look great.
Not much to do. This game needs more variation in side activities.
Relationships could had been awesome perks. Can you imagine, hearing the sound of a sniper when you are corner during a gun fight. You peek out an is Panam saving your hide. Then you go home after a days works you go to bed and Panam is laying next to you. Panam makes you breakfast next morning. You get a buff for eating your meal. Are ready to tackle what ever comes your way.
Character skills take forever to unlock. Progression is feels bad.


Side note: Good game developing teams are gone now. Every time you launch this game. You get a pop up launcher with ads before you are able to play the game you payed for."
1609716055,"A fun RPG. I like the futuristic look and feel of the game. It is fun to play, and you can spend a ton of time in Night City. The bad is that there are quite a few glitches and some of the missions can get repetitive. Overall it is still a good game to me and worth the price."
1609715817,needs more Fentanyl
1609715804,"despite all its bugs it really is a great game, with amazing story and characters. cant wait for them to fix it."
1609715763,"Cyberpunk 2077 is a pretty good title.
ATM it's in a rough state for all but better end for us pc gamers that have above the requirements.
My main issues with the game is that V on my end sometimes jumps into things.
It sucks when I'm trying to do a stealth option in a mission and it glitches me onto things knocking things out of way making alot of noise causing me to redo that part of the mission and the ghost item.
Other than that I've bin really enjoying the game.
I'm barely on the 2nd faze of the main quest, all I've bin doing the side quests (gigs and bounties).
All in all it was worth my money and I hope the game get polished soon.
I feel it will just a rough and shitty launch but it will get better."
1609715704,"Game is incredible, have barely had any bugs, runs like a beautiful dream on my mediocre gaming laptop. Sorry some people have had issues but idk man"
1609715679,its great
1609715661,"Pretty fun as is, definitely not finished though. On the other hand, CD Projekt Red goes hard on updates, so patience will be rewarded."
1609715648,has few bugs but haven't seen anything game breaking least not on pc. Has great story for what Ive seen and overhaul pretty good
1609715608,Not very good.
1609715314,"Great game 
I wouldnt listen to the reviews about how buggy it is because it varies from person to person. for example ive played over 45 hours and havent come across any crashes and game breaking glitches. yes ive come across some glitches but the ones ie experience have been stuff like a car in the distance(no where near me) slightly go up into the air and fall down, stuff like tht."
1609715309,it ok
1609715279,"One thing I need to say about this game is that the story is fantastic. If a cyberpunk film came out with the story it has now then I would be so interested whilst watching it. However, the rest of the side content that involves exploration has too many bugs to comprehend, people will come at me for saying this but the game has been in development for so long and it makes no sense to why this game is so buggy. From steam i would not recommend this game at all but if you really want to play this game, even with all the hate this game has got, I strongly suggest you buy this game from CDkeys for much cheaper."
1609715193,Awesome game.
1609715172,"nice game
"
1609715068,The ultimate lure and romance of Cyberpunk is to intoxicate yourself with the illusion of escaping your current life to a future no matter how flawed it is. This game and its whole launch debacle is a perfect real-life rendition of this spirit.
1609715065,Sure it has a load of bugs. But the game is still fucking good imo. Not so much to say about that.
1609715046,Storylines cool different love reeves. Incomplete game full of hundreds of bugs.
1609715019,quite buggy innit
1609714996,"so far no bugs and loving every second 
"
1609714986,I have not run into the issues that everyone on console is complaining about. I have enjoyed the game with minimal issues. No more than any other game. The city is very fun to explore and the game keeps bringing me back.
1609714919,This game has the best dialogue of out any game ive ever played. enjoyed every second of my 130+ hours. lots of bugs but everything else is perfect
1609714895,"Even with all the bugs, I love this game!"
1609714888,"too many bugs and glitches. thought it would be hot fixed by now, but every hot fix seems to make it worse. the graphical bugs I can live with, but very often things stop working. You cant shoot, aim, jump or sprint. This screws with missions you are on and can make you have to restart.

Saving your game and reloading your save fixes the bug, for a time"
1609714877,"Incredibly buggy, missing features, and the dev outright lied about the system requirements.

I can no longer get my refund but this is a warning to anyone looking forward to buying the game. Don't. In it's current state, the game isn't worth it."
1609714811,"Disclaymer: if you're running high-end gaming rig and was NOT expecting a masterpiece from this game, THEN it is a solid yes.
I wouldn't rate Cyberpunk 2077 higher than 8/10, provided the bugs are patched and broken crafting economy is fixed.

CDPR went out of their skin to make a game to rule all other games, aiming at getting GTA style open world filled by Destiny style action and loot system, all on top of stry driven RPG that would foster multiple playthroughs. And as we know it, they failed.

While Night City itself is a great work of map design and architecture, its is shallow in comparison to living and breathing cities of GTA 4 and 5. Poorly executed driving does not help. The game engine is spread thin to process high end graphics and multiple systems, so that crowd and cops feel as an afterthought. Crowd is outright dumb and behave in a manner  you'd expect form a 2010-s open world game. Cops appear out of nowhere should you commit a crime, and would disappear as soon as you run past next block and turn the corner.

Shooting is satisfactory, but fails in comparison to Destiny (whihc was obviusly taken as an example) and other FPS games. Intoriduction of smart guns (autoaiming bullets) is fun, but feels like a means to avoid lack of proper gunplay that would foster palyer skill, which I admit is excessive for an RPG. Enemies are bullet-sponges, and can tank a few head shots from shotgun of high-cal revolver, which breaks immersion.

RPG elements are on top. Unlike Witcher, we can build our own character in terms of gameplay, ability usage and combat focus (gunblasing, brute force melee, laid back hacker cybermage, etc). All key character traits affect dialogue choices (albeit not providing story changing options). Build variety is on top.

Story is what made fight through bugs during post-release time, and made stay to play the now nearly fixed game.

Among my personal preferences, and things that make value this game, is the deliberate omage to old-school sci-fi games of 1990-s, like Syndicate, Crusader and less renowned titles. From visual design of menu and minimap, the music theme there, and of course the City itself, with its retrofuturistic architecture, all remind me of those games of old, that formed my obsession with sci-fi and cyberpunk genres in particular. 

This game was made with passion, a passion CDPR's higher ups seemingly did not share. While we should not  excuse CDPR management's mistakes and misinformation, I ffel it is important to properly value the effort put by developers. Of the ambitions plans set before them, they made a solid game, filled with passion and love for the source material. It is just shame that they were not given enough time to finalize it..."
1609714669,really awesome game! It has so much potential to become better. I know it has many flaws but I know within time the developers will roll out with updates to slowly fix every problem!!
1609714573,"Full of bugs, but quite possibly my favorite game of all time.

Full of ideas. Ridiculous amount of ways to play the game.

Still 100% should have been delayed another 2 months.

One-off little side events (not even side quests) often have their own mini or interconnected story-lines (often time very compelling)."
1609714558,"Buggy as all heck, quite poorly optimized but beautiful environments"
1609714396,"It's a buggy mess, but it does have a great story so I'd still recommend it."
1609714346,yea its cyberpunk 2077
1609714313,ITS AWESOME LOVING EVERY SECOND OF IT!!!
1609714308,Its Breathtaking
1609719661,"There's a lot of hate directed at this game for the state it was released in and disappointment off overhyped expectations, but I think once the dust settles from that, this will be seen for what it is: a great game. A well written, well acted story in a rich world where every encounter is different and has it's own personality, a nice refresher from the lazy copy/pasted content from a lot of other open world games. There's still some rough edges, maybe some decisions could matter more, but the core of the game is the content, and that's still solid. The world will immerse you, if you let it, and you may get some genuine feels if you're the type that has them. Plus you get to hang out with Keanu Reeves.

It's not perfect, not the best game ever made, but it's still really great. And these days of waning single-player, narrative driven games, that's exceedingly rare. I for one salute the writers, devs and artists that put years of their life into this, you can see that reflected in the game. The launch failures (as seems to be a pattern nowadays) were the fault of inept management decisions. I'm only sorry that the creatives and workers had to face crunch (also bad management) then see their hard work get shit on."
1609714083,Great idea. Terrible storytelling. Another boring sandbox.
1609714055,"[b]Waiting for patches is a very good idea if you don't have a computer that can run the game well in its current state or if bugs get on your nerves easily.[/b]

I had fun but I also have an above average spec computer, didn't run into any game breaking bugs (there were plenty of annoying ones but nothing that broke the game completely) and was not that hyped to begin with. Quests that actually have dialogue and were not just ""shot this person and/ or interact with this thing to win"" were very enjoyable and I'd love to get some more of those in an expansion down the line.

Combat is fun when the framerate is stable. It’s very easy to get to a point where you one hit every enemy so I recommend playing on very hard so that some of them also one hit you in return."
1609713992,"Great game, great story, great immersion. Not perfect but one of the better ones I have played. The story involves and keeps you interested till the end. Your choices on character building will make you want to try playing with different skills. To me it's similar to Fallout 3 and 4, Skyrim, and Oblivion. Games I have played for hours and hours."
1609713922,"i dont remember the last time a game, buggy or not felt as good as this one"
1609713870,"Overall the game is fun, but there's a vast amount of potential wasted.

Pros:
-Night City looks amazing. There is plenty of detail and the lighting looks phenomenal. The setting is easily the best part of this game.
-The characters in the game really draw you into the story. The story itself is fairly short, but if you do the major sidequests, it's very rewarding.
-The combat is pretty good. The customization is solid and the different types of weapons are cool to experiment with. There's some imbalance here (netrunning is very strong IMO) but I think all types of character builds will be satisfying.

Cons:
-Bugs and glitches. Although none of them were game-breaking for me, they really break the immersion of the game. Most of them were characters doing weird things when walking, using stairs, getting in vehicles.
-Shallow open world. The map is pretty large and there are plenty of ""gigs"" to do, but they are all cookie cutters. You basically need to get inside a building via stealth or killing everyone then either assassinate someone, steal something, or rescue someone. Fun at first but it quickly gets repetitive.
-Choice has little effect on the game. Really only the ending changes, mostly things just unlock depending on what you do. For all the choices you make, it's really disappointing.
-Main story is really short. I spent over 100 hours on this game and I would say 10-20 were related to the main story. I really only remember 3 main missions.
-AI is bad. I killed a lot of enemies by just shooting through walls and they made not attempt to move after being shot in the head.

Cyberpunk really is a breathtaking game for a while. Towards the end of the game, it really lost its magic. When I was done with my playthrough, I felt no real desire to continue. Overall, it's a good game and I'd recommend it, but it definitely did not live up to they hype if you're expecting game of the year.
"
1609713799,"As someone who's favorite game is The Witcher 3 and someone who has a lot of respect and admiration for CDPR, this game is truly mediocre as hell.

It felt incredibly cheap, like an offbrand open world game. It also doesn't do anything new. 

Once I finished the main story and a few side quests I had absolutely no desire to play any further, or explore any further - and I am someone who loves seeking out every inch of a game world, collecting every collectable, and completing every side quest. Valhalla is holding my attention significantly more than this game did.

Gameplay was ok. Shooting was ok. Most of it was just ok. Nothing stood out. Melee was incredibly shallow. I spent most of the time playing with the mantis blades and there's a massive collection of ONE single execution animation and it throws a cog into the flow of combat, which became annoying very quickly.

Animations are terrible, especially when a character dies. They seem to like to stick a leg up in the air for some reason, and turn incredibly stiff.

There's a video on YouTube I watched today that inspired me to write this. It's basically a comparison between Red Dead 2 and Cyberpunk which highlights an array of differences and how each game displays/performs each feature. It truly highlighted how mediocre this game is.

Better luck next time CDPR, hope the next Witcher game is a significant step up from this."
1609713693,"Artistically brilliant, technically miserable.

Pretty much unplayable at the moment, wait a year or two and hope CDPR fixes it."
1609713667,"I figured I would try another RPC since been grinding on Fallout76.  This, I think is put together right.  Plenty and I mean plenty of story-lines.  I love games with depth and this has it.  I mean, that is why I like Fallout and WoW since they too invest in lore/story-lines heavily.  Would recommend this to people to try."
1609713597,"I have a pretty beast computer but the game play is still buggy at times. I am glad they released it despite the bugs as the game is still TONS of FUN! If you have a good system, you will have a good time, otherwise wait until they update or patch it"
1609713591,"no matter what other people say in my opinion devs made realy great game
and i just wanted to say that i appreciate they job
so thank you dev team for your work its really good game"
1609713583,Love this game. There is a lot to do.
1609713550,"I love everything about this game, the story the detail the gameplay. i would tell anyone to play it"

1609713500,Swag!!!!!!!!!!!
1609713388,"Bad driving, terrible wanted system, and enough glitches to make Skyrim look perfect."
1609713343,"Spent 4 hours tweaking the settings, couldn't get a refund"
1609713296,"Everyone talking about bugs ruining immersion.  If you could play an 8bit game game get immersed, you won't have a problem, here.  BUGS DON'T BREAK IMMERSION.  Immersion is broken when YOU  let it be broken.  That being said, there is a gem of a game here, underneath the bugs.  Just like Skyrim.  Give it some time and the modding community and CDPR will polish it all out.  Or do like me and just play it now, and enjoy what it has to offer, which is quite a lot, actually.

The graphics are amazing, but whatever.

The gameplay is varied depending on your build and playing through multiple times to experience different builds is encouraged,

Dialogue choices are shallow and have little meaning, which is a shame, but we havent seen a  game do that well since Planescape: Torment,

Buying the game won't make you regret it, even if it takes a bi of time for the game to ripen and become what you want it to be."
1609713263,Only gets better!!
1609713234,"liked it, would buy again."
1609713212,"I will give this game..... 6/10 Dumm dumm duuuuummmm 

Gameplay:
Wonky and you can feel the devs dont know how to handle gunplay propperly. The auto cover is alright, but this is the only gun play that is in this game
Meele is waaayyy more fun, but can be too wonky sometimes. 
Dont get me started on the driving as i think enough people have complained over it. Simple explination, try an 1995 driving simulator, the driving feels about the same just worse.
Crafting is done nicely as you can feel they got experience in this. Collecting blueprints and find materials is cool and the items you can craft are really worth it.... but heres the catch, once you reach lvl 20 in the spec and you can create legendary items... The game is useless, as you can now sell items for HUGE amounts of cash and craft items that make you godlike, and the sniper you got from the ass godess PANAM, is just.... stupid... LVL that thing up and you can 5 shot the last boss... Fun i guess 

Graphics:
The overall graphics will blow you away in the beginning. I run max lvl and the city is just amazing, the city is full of lights and huge buildings creating a realistic mindblowing experience..... And then you look close and see that... thats it. The NPC look alright and wary quit alright... buuut the animation is SHIT. What ever the NPC is doing, it looks soo bad. Eating, walking, talking or anything. The second you are near them with a car, they become those goats that cramp up once they are scared. Planks everywhere, the voice lines make nooo sense and certain NPC will repeat the same line throughout the game everytime you walk past... ""Sooo are we going to talk about yesterday"" is a line that is now in my nightmares

Bugs:
I survived pretty well without bugs after i updated my graphics driver... buuut lets go, with a little song
Lets begin with the little thing, that trees hunt you as they come alive and start bountsing 
NPC dissapearing into the ground and other housing 
Quest line fail as you companien chooses to dissapear
And setting in the driver side merged together with a NPC is quite the fear. 
Hard crashes a rare but do happened 
T-posing is dayli thing if you can imagined 
A Dick that peeks out is funny as hell
And suddenly being naked is quite swell 

This is just some, but there are many smaller bugs out there
What  will piss you the most off are the explosive things that are scattered around the map, mostly around battle areas... I think 80% of my death are from the bastards... as a stray bullet hits one near you, insta killing you no matter the lvl and yea NO MATTER THE LVL, i am almost lvl 40.... and accedently hit a explosive with a godlike FIST of mine... yup there i go...

Story:
The story... THeeee story though, dammit CDPR knows how to write some interesting chr... Johnny is for me awesome, he got some create character design and got quite the resolution and change in the end, which will differe compared to how you treat him. AWESOME. The love intrest are uniqe and cool, Panam is a bad ass outlander that got a pretty cool story arc of returning to her family. Judy is lovely and hard headed, her last mission where you learn of her pasts is propperly one of the best quest i have ever played, and the payoff is quite good  ;) ""If you play as female"". I havent tryed the male options yet aaand honestly the stuborn detective is rather... boring. Johnny's old band member is quite alright but not... sooo interesting. The main story line is a bit predicting in the beginning, buuuut once you get the title screen it becomes alot better and unique. 
Yet again ALOT of side quest... but sadly most of them simple revolve around... yea killing people or stealing something... Only some side quest are unique and intresting, example the one where you have to crusifix a dude... damn that gave me a bad taste. Compared to the side quest in the witcher where you have to kill a king and feel you make a impact... Nothing like that happens here... You dont see any impact of your actions and dont feel like you make a change... So thats that

Final thought:
Sooo here we are.... somehow you managed to read all this bad english but yea.... The game got promise but sadly... the current state it is in... i will, ""Again"" say a 6/10- 
Gameplay is a: 4/10
Graphics: 5/10
Story: 6/10

last thoughts are that.. the game is really immersive and really draws you in, in the beginning. Buuut once you got some time out there you beging to see some lose ends... I rushed quite quickly to the end in the beginning in hard mode, and it was quite the experience, but... i dont really feel like there is more to it... The game starts out by making you think you have ENDLESS options..... but then... in the end... it dosen't and lets you hang on a... un satisfied feeling...
But... with my love to it anyways, and now around 70hours gametime... i Will give it personally a 8/10. Reason why i give it ""no to recommend"" is because you should wait... til the DLC's are out, the bugs are fixed and the overall state is better. I think it got potentiel.



"
1609713206,Love it
1609713196,Good so far.
1609713189,"Great game. I've been one of the lucky ones with hardware that could handle the game from day one, so it's been a good experience thus far. Not everything we were promised, but still a game that revolutionizes the genre."
1609713164,"It's OK I guess. I sunk 100 hours into it, completed every side mission, every gig, every NCPD ""side hussles"" and NSPC ""crimes in progress"", and I have no desire to go back to it. The game has a myriad of technical issues, and suffers greatly because of them. 

The main story is decent, but how your relationship with Johnny effects things could be fleshed out more, rather than the ""forced interactions"" with his character. 

Overall I wouldn't recommend Cyberpunk."

1609713127,"ContentCut 2077 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CymqHdNYkg&ab_channel=BeatEmUps

1609713006,game lol
1609712993,"Played through, got 2 endings so far ( 62 hour save file not through steam ) currently completing all side content and loving it. Had a view visual glitches, suffered some audio glitches but nothing game breaking and no crashes."
1609712905,Disappointment compared to the hype...
1609712832,"The game was falsely advertised and is essentially a scam as most of the promised features are missing, the game runs like shit and the physics and other interactions in the game are worse than games released more than a decade ago. As a gamer my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined."
1609712734,"wait that was the ""good"" ending?"
1609712715,"This game is better than I initially thought after my initial impression upon release. Missed opportunities, cut content, broken promises aside... 

Bottom line is the game is fun to play if you have a decent system, I have not had a serious bug or glitch yet in 71 hours of play time. I rate this game about a 7.5-8/10. The combat is fun, the game is kind of fun when you get away from the heavy question. Question too much too soon sort of stifles your character progression. Unlocking perks and gaining equipment to customize how you approach somewhat samey situations makes it more fun."
1609712664,"Amazing story, not actually a functional game though. Functional enough to play but not functional enough to be praised, yknow?"
1609712661,"I had fun, so that's enough for me to recommend it"
1609712642,"I finished the game and only encountered an handful of bugs (only visual, objects stuck in the air). I really liked this game and I would suggest to get it because it is a mixed of Watch Dogs, GTA5 and Skyrim. I am going back to finish all the side missions, but I am eagerly  waiting for the DLC"
1609712606,Good game despite drama around it. Very fun.
1609712587,"While this game has its fair share of bugs/glitches, they rarely take the experience away from you. I love the story (with the side missions being even better then some of the main ones). The graphics are 10/10, but as I said before the bugs are quite abundant. If you purchase this game a couple months after release it will be alot better with the future patches."
1609712514,"I have had a great time with cyberpunk.  The game is buggy, but I personally haven't run into game breaking bugs.  The game is not optimized well.  I have a high end PC and cannot run this game smoothly.  I have to turn RTX off.  I have a RTX 2080.  Ryzen 2700X and 32GB of ram.  Running on high settings at 2K, I average 40-60fps.  With RTX on, it drops to the 30s or lower.  If you can excuse the bugs, it is a fun game with a great story in my opinion.  If you are not expecting the second coming of Jesus Christ with this game, then you will probably be happy.  But to get the most enjoyment, you will need a higher end PC.  I mainly treat this like a Elderscrolls or Fallout title.  Big world, big story, lots of quests that intersect with each other.  Lots of bugs that the testers cannot test for every possible outcome.  Runs poorly, pushes limits on PCs.  Runs like shit on consoles.  Eventually fixed and made better by modders.  Will always have a lesser experience on consoles and low end PCs.  My main issues are there being no third person except in driving.  People like to see their created characters in the game.  The only time you do are in rare cutscenes and when you have the option to look in the mirror.  Which always takes a performance hit when I do so.  Also, best be happy with your character's looks, because there is no option to redo it or even get a hair cut, which is really strange in a game about a future where you can change everything about your body.  You can download mods to edit your save file to change the appearance.  You cannot preview how clothes will look on your character before you buy them.  You have to spend money to find out.  And some items are very expensive.  Driving in the game is odd.  Handling physics seem off to me and roads are extremely small for a major city."
1609712451,buggy but good
1609712381,Might be buggy but still a great game.
1609712378,"Aside from the bugs in the initial launch, the game has a rich story and decent side missions to keep you mindlessly entertained. 8/10 would play again."
1609712360,lots of bugs but really fun to explore
1609712337,"I would recommend Cyberpunk. Its not the most polished game I've played but it is fun and so far it has an interesting plot. I have noticed a few smaller bugs like cell phones sticking in place midair after a character was using it and a few other small glitches, overall I haven't seen anything game-breaking. While I don't necessarily feel like this is a GOTY contender (especially with the console fiasco) it is pretty solid. I could easily see me dumping a few hundred hours into it over time like I did with skyrim and fallout 4."
1609712262,Only have about 6 hours into the game. I've only experienced a couple glitches here and there but nothing game breaking or even that noticeable. Overall a good story so far love the player customization its something you don't really see with any other game to my knowledge something new and exciting.
1609712246,"Best open world game I’ve played in a long, long time. It has its quarks but definitely nothing worse than I’ve had with any Bethesda game. Can’t wait to see what the future hold for the game."
1609712229,
1609712201,"The big side missions were the best part of the game, story missions were alright, some characters were appealing, combat could be fun or terrible at times, npcs were buggy and the ai bad especially the police which are by far the worst police ive seen in a game as they dont really do much other than make you walk to the other side of the road so they dont instantly shoot you for walking near them, i enjoyed the time i had in it for the most part but there was just so much more they shouldve added that they took out, game needed another year or two before releasing, pretty much everything showed in the 2018 game trailer had more to offer than this"
1609711738,Awesome game despite minor and accidental bugsr
1609711685,Pretty good.
1609711635,"This game has more bugs than a bee hive. I tried to get a refund but my dumb ass played the game for 9 hours instead of less than 7 hours.

1609714502,"[code][i]Cyberpunk 2077[/i] is an open-world, action-adventure role-playing video game, developed and published by CD Projekt RED that was released December 10, 2020.[/code]

[h1]👋 First impression[/h1]

Unlike a lot of people, I found out about the game much later, which means I didn't wait as long as some other people to play it. After learning about it and deciding to take it, I thought it was another game based on what our planet might look like in the future. Then I started playing and slowly got into the game, which helped me realize that I had been wrong so far.

[h1]🎮 Gameplay[/h1]

[i]Cyberpunk[/i] is an open world with an FPS style in which players are able to customize their characters however they want in many different ways. Exploring Night City, shooting weapons, close combat and hacking. All this in order to pass the main and side missions.

[b]•Exploring:[/b]
Exploring the city is strongly recommended because only then can you find all the fast travel points to move faster when you think you have enjoyed the beautiful city enough. It is also recommended because this way you find the random quests that will not be displayed on your map. But the most important thing is just to be able to enjoy the views in and out of Night City. The developers have really tried to make it lively and beautiful.

[b]•Weapons:[/b]
The weapon system in [i]Cyberpunk 2077[/i] is very good for me personally. We have the standard classes - common, uncommon, rare, epic and legendary. The weapons also have additional damage like electric, toxic and fire. They look good visually, but they don't matter much. I think more could have been done here. Many of the games offer damaged effects to have a stronger effect on some types of opponents and less on others. For example, the toxic should work more on robots, fire on humans and so on.

Despite the small mistake of shooting weapons, I must note that I have absolutely no objections to melee weapons. In my opinion, they are quite original, there is no repetitions of the blows and the damage is reasonable.

Many of the legendary weapons are hidden in various locations on the map and can be taken completely free and without the need to go through missions or give in-game currency, which is very positive in my opinion. 

[b]•Skill trees:[/b]
The game offers many different builds for your character. You can play stealth, melee, brawler, just with guns, hacker or whatever else you can think of. Something I don't think the game performed well with is the presentation to the players. How to get different points to different skills, how we should develop and so on. It took me a lot of time and a lot of watched videos about different things to figure out how to handle them. When I realized how things work, I was impressed by how many different ways you can actually develop your V.

[b]•Crafting:[/b]
The crafting system is made in a very interesting way. In order to be able to take full advantage of it, you actually have to develop your character as a crafter. It's nice when you score the necessary points from skills you can craft various legendary and epic items, of course if you have found the recipes for them, which is not so easy. Based on what other skill trees offer, I don't think it's worth developing as a crafter, though. With all these videos on YouTube, you can put together complete sets of legendary armor and weapons without much effort, and I think the developers did not anticipate this factor. If it weren't for all these location videos and so on, developing your character as a crafter would be worth a lot more, as you wouldn't be able to get legendary sets so easily.

[b]•Police:[/b]
I also want to say a few words about the police. I just don't feel like it's right. My first complaint is that there is no persecution. No matter what you do, there is simply no persecution. My other complaint is about the higher level of the police. Well, it just destroys you. You have no chance of resistance or anything. It's in the game, but it's just not an interesting part of it. It needs a little development.


[h1]📖 Story[/h1]

As the developers have said, your every decision is important for how the game will develop for you. This is shown from the beginning. The game gives you 3 choices to start with:

-The Corpo-Rat - V starts in the Arasaka Tower, where Arthur Jenkins gives them a job to take out another corporate employee.

-The Nomad - V, a lone nomad on their way to Night City, has car issues on the border to the badlands and is forced to seek the services of a local mechanic.

-Street Kid - V is running a job for Kirk Sawyer, who provides them with the technology to steal a high-end Rayfield Aerondight owned by Kaoru Fujioka.

I will not go into more detail about the differences between these three starts. Despite such a promising start, the game always comes to a point where everything is the same for all three variants of V, which is a bit disappointing, but I still appreciate the diligence that people have put in. A lot of people complain about the fact that the game gets to the same point, but I can't think of many other titles that have even had different starts, so I don't think it's right to complain about that.

The game is really quite modernized. It offers you the option to find a partner regardless of your gender or what gender you are interested in. You have to be very careful what you do with each character, because every decision you make can screw things up about the relationship you want to have with that character. Be careful about that. The side quests are done in a great and exciting way too.

[h1]💻 Graphics / Art-style[/h1]

The graphics are great even at the lowest settings. The characters are made in many different and interesting ways. Also to this section I should note how impressed I am with photo mode. Different angles, poses, smiles, blurs, even have filters and stickers. This is something I'm seeing for the first time in a game and I'm really positively impressed and I really hope other games take an example and add similar features too.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2344907149

[h1]🎼 Soundtrack[/h1]

Ever since the first Cyberpunk 2077 teaser trailer, we’ve known that the game was going to have one banging soundtrack. We have different music styles - rock, punk, hip-hop, and rap with an electronic undertone riding throughout nearly every track.

Something in which Cyberpunk is the first game to do is the non copyrighted music! God bless the human being who came up with that idea. They have dealt with the problems that have plagued many YouTubers and streamers for some time. I hope the other games start doing such thing too. 

[h1]📊 Performance[/h1]

[i]Cyberpunk 2077[/i] has a lot of bugs and during those 110 hours I played the game I encountered a lot of them. Most were pretty fun, I can't lie. I really laughed out loud in my room. Others, however, were quite disturbing and irritating. Spontaneous deaths, the car does not come when I call her and so on. Also, despite the powerful computer I have, I did not feel free to make the most of the graphics and see the full beauty of the game. There are certain zones in which whatever you do will lag until you get out of there.

[h1]📋 Conclusion[/h1]

You make the conclusion cus' steam capped my review."
1609711623,yes very good
1609711583,"so i preface this with ""my GF got the ps4 version and its a bag of cats"" so yeah; but I'm some 360 hours in, and loving it. its got bugs, but I've only had a single hard crash, i put it on par with my experience with the witcher 3 when it came out, people seem to forget that was a buggy mess at launch, and we got a ton of free DLC to buy us off, and now its considered a masterpiece.

while i picked up new hardware for it, it even ran on my older PC pretty decently running 3 year old hardware. ignore the marketing, they always shoot themselves in the foot, its got a good plot, good acting, rewarding mechanics, and top style points. its sci-fi witcher with a slightly lamer protagonist, and no solution for that since its create your own, only so much they can do and still give us options without ditching a lot of the gloss and just making a CRPG."
1609711563,game is not broken anymore which is great! It's very fun and worth it in my opinion!!!
1609711559,"Completed this game 100% and was 100% disappointed. 

All bugs, missing features, and other technical issues placed aside, this game is just bad. It's worse than Witcher 3 in every way possible. This game was legitimately a chore to finish and honestly of the 80 hours I put into my playthrough, I had fun for maybe 8 of those hours. 

The game cobbles together ideas from every contemporary open-world title (like GTA, Assassin's Creed, Fallout, etc.), but executes all of those ideas in such a half-assed and arguably insulting manner that you're left wondering why they even bothered to attempt to make this game to begin with.

Gone is any sense of role-play, choice and consequence, engaging world-building, strong character development, or immersive quest design. The game is a mess of repetitive samey content where you ultimately don't care about anything or anyone. Character's don't exist to be real, believable characters that you can connect with, but rather they serve as obvious plot devices. The world is barren of any memorable experiences. 

Most of the game is driven by death, both on a gameplay level and on a narrative level. Most of the game amounts to killing the same sorts of enemies in redudant quest markers around the world. This *is* the exploration. Follow a marker, find some people to kill, rinse and repeat. The narrative follows this same design philosophy, with pretty much the entire narrative being driven by one character dying or another. Most of the characters within the narrative then logically develop purely through these deaths, and not through any sort of real personal motivation; it's a narrative driven through reactionary storytelling centered around death. 

10% of this game was narrative or character driven quests, while 90% of it was killing the same brain-dead humans over-and-over.

Witcher 3 took less time to complete than this game, yet managed to have more heart in a single quest than this game had in its entire run-time."
1609711559,Controller issues. No usefull help from any tech support. FUCK YOU Steam!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1609711461,"A game that was supposed to be ""complete"" in comparison with the E3 version feels nothing more than an empty shell. Already i finished majority of the endings, gigs, sidequests, what then? What can you do once you finish everything? Unfortunately, as of right now, I felt compelled to give this game a not recommended for this exact reason until they bring back the promise we were exactly given! 

Btw I remember something that has bothered me with not just the overall e3 video but also the lies that the execs from cdpr have said.

CDPR: we have greatly enhanced the crowd and community system...
Me: that's not what your day 1 game release says. The crowd system feels watered down in comparison to e3. When you kill a civilian, a cop spawns out of nowhere behind you and shoots you without arresting you.

I was seriously hoping that it was going to be like GTA but more of a futuristic type of gta with all the meat in like in a lot of gta games with cyberpunk. This game has serious potential for that. Please bring that all back as was promised in the game!"
1609711250,Very gud game
1609711237,"After playing this for 251 hours, I feel like CDPR stole The Witcher series from a developer that actually knows how to make a game, and claimed to make it themselves. Because I simply can't fathom how a dev can go from really good to 100% shit after having this garage heap in development for 8 year, I mean holy fuck this game is so fucking buggy it's retarded. Can't even walk down the street without randomly blowing the fuck up."
1609711175,it is good
1609711113,"Damn this was a wild ride! It is an amazing game that offers a good storyline that feels fresh and interesting..For me it has a  lot of replay value. Now that I have seen one end I am even more encouraged to do the side quests to unlock alternative endings.
Also ""Night City"" is just a great place to stroll around. 
It feels unique around every corner and I never had so much fun taking photos ingame.

From a technical view, I had two crashes, but lost almost no progress, so no harm done. The AI of the enemies is sometimes very annoying for stealth gameplay. For my taste hidden bodies got discovered too easily in dark corners and the guys on patrol did not follow realistic routes. They got stuck a lot.  So don't expect ""Dishonored"" or ""Deus Ex"".
But i switched to shooting an everything was good LOL

When they fix the bugs in the next months to come it will be a true masterpiece in my opinion. 
So find your inner Johnny and start playing!"
1609711107,Going all in on melee was some of the most fun I've had in single player gaming in the past few years.
1609711099,"At first it was a bit slow and there's a lot to figure out but once you get going it's a blast. I'm lucky enough to have a rig that can handle the game, but still there are a few bugs and glitches that are more annoying than game breaking. The amount of stuff to do and places to explore is outstanding. The characters are wonderful, the story is engaging, and there are a lot of side missions that are very well done and interesting. The amount of time you can spend in this game doing all that there is to do is an insane for a $60 price tag. There are a few gripes I have with some design choices, but nothing that makes me want to stop playing. When CDPR figures out the problems it does have, this game will definitely be worth it, but for now unless you're willing to experience some minor inconveniences wait for some patches."
1609710987,If you have a machine that can run it and you remember the glitches from skyrim fondly then this game will blow you away. Great story and gameplay.
1609710951,The bugs are pretty minor. Haven't had any game breaking bugs. Driving feels a little clunky. Wish it was better. Combat pretty fun stuff
1609710942,goodgdgdgodood
1609710866,"This game is like a beautiful girl with no brains. Looks nice on the outside but the lights aint on and the soul is dead.

I just can't believe the amount missing from this game.  It all looks pretty but that's it.  Even though I've had a little enjoyment from the game, right from the start it just felt wrong in so many areas of the game that just made me think where is the soul in this game that CDPR kept showing us. I'm not one to say don't buy it because some peeps love it and some hate it. I would say just wait a year or so before buying it and hopefully it will have a lot more added by then."
1609710864,"I have an older PC (i7-6700K CPU, 1080 GPU, 16GB RAM) and play on a 2560x1440 monitor on high settings. The game looks visually great to me (though I do wish I could run it on higher settings and maintain decent FPS).

The story is amazing and the side quests are engaging enough that I actually feel compelled to do them. I hope there will be more content added (more cyberware, more large side quests, etc.) but the amount so far is enough that I'm still on my first play through and only (I think) maybe half way through the story. 

There are some glitches here and there but they're not terrible or so frequent as to make the game experience unplayable, at least for me. The only recurring issue I have that makes me really annoyed is when audio from characters doesn't play, though this is normally fixed by dropping a quick-save and then loading it. Still annoying though.

Overall if you can handle slight glitches and have a computer comparable to mine (or don't mind playing on medium graphics) then I would highly recommend getting this game."
1609710778,Bugs? Yes but nothing game breaking for me. My overall impression? An unpolished masterpiece that will get better with time but is already incredible in it's current state. I've sunk over 100 hours into this game and still feel like there's plenty of room and depth to explore.
1609710771,"Dig it, Bugs haven't really been an issue for me so far"
1609710760,Glitchy and seems a bit unpolished but still fun
1609710709,"I like it, the quests are pretty entertaining so far and I guess future patches and DLCs will make it even more entertaining."
1609710675,"Shut the f... up and forget about bugs!!!
Enjoy the game!"
1609710660,sexy games
1609710653,"So many features that the game was advertised with are either not implemented or implemented poorly, the open world is so poorly done that it severely hindered the experience I had going between missions."
1609710643,+ Keanu Reeves.
1609710572,Great living breathing world. Countless bugs. Limitless potential once they're dealt with.
1609710428,Love it
1609710418,"In all honesty i havent had too many bugs.
First week i had frame issues, but thats pretty much been resolved.
Is it flawless? No.
Is any game flawless? No.
Its good 
"
1609710363,"I didn't follow the development of this game and didn't have high expectations, but it still managed to disappoint me. I expected the combat to be one-dimensional, and character customization to be inconsequential (as was the case with the Witcher 3) and the goal to be to stimulate manchildren who want to escape into a world of neon lights and clubkids where the scope of the human condition is limited to a sort of bizarre caricature of uninformed, adolescent cynicism and tired, one-note, bladerunner aesthetic. Unfortunately, the game doesn't even accomplish being the kind of terrible it's trying to be. The city is huge, but mostly empty - it's a giant amusement park with no rides or attractions. It plays like they gave up on it about 25% of the way into creating content, and decided instead to make a ubisoft-formula inspired non-experience that's somehow even more redundant and boring than a ubisoft game. We can only hope this abject failure will inspire/force at least a handful of developers to make games worth playing, and not just simplistic, dopamine generators that haven't yet been made obsolete by mobile games. Add this to the long list of reasons to despair for modernity and the copy-pasted amalgams of tired memes, social media insecurities, unimaginative escapism, and motivated reasoning we have come to recognize as homosapiens. Art is dead and there's no one left to mourn its passing."
1609710327,"A few annoying bugs, can't do as much as one might've wanted but it's a solid game. 8/10"
1609710284,poop
1609710263,Game is half arsed and should't have been released. NPC AI is about what you'd expect from a PS3 game. Bugs completely ruin the immersion in what is actually a pretty good story line although be it very linear with no a heap of choice in how your life paths actually play out. Gun play is fun but gets boring after a few hours. I'm at loss for how more people aren't demanding refunds after this games release with all of it's blatantly false advertising.
1609710289,"Its fun, and that is all that matters."
1609794453,"Türkçe İnceleme buradadır./the English Review is below.

Eveet... başlayalım dünyanın en iyi oyunu olucak iken radikal kararlar ile erken çıkmak zorunda kalıp en iyi oyun olma yolunda ki uzun serüvene.. ki muhtemelen 2 yıl içinde dünyanın en iyi oyunu da olucaktır buna güvenim tam neyse incelemeye başlayalım.
 Hikayemiz 1900'lü yıllarda Saburo Arasaka'nın babası ile başlıyor, 1993 yıllarında Richard Night'ın Coronado City hayali ile şekilleniyor. Fakat işler yolunda gitmiyor maalesef Arasakalar'ın saldırısı ile Richard Night 1998 suikast edilerek öldürülüyor ve onun anısına yani Night City'e biz yani V(Kadın-12 Ağustos 2049/Erkek 10 Haziran 2049) şuan ki 27 yaşında dünyaya ayaklarımızı basıyoruz.
 Şehir Richard Night'ın şekillendirdiği şekilde gitmediği için artık zaten az kalmış şehirlerden biri olan Night City de yaşamanın kısıtlı zenginin çok zengin fakirin tam fakir olarak yaşadığı zaman oluyor ve bu yüzden de yaşamın berbat olduğu ilk 3 şehirden biri oluyor.
 Bizde yolculuğumuzda bazı şeylere karar verirken asıl amacımız Efsaneleşmek olan nefes kesici bir maceraya atılıyoruz bir PARALI ASKER olarak.
SPOILER ALERT.
 Burayı atlayamazdım çünkü biz bu oyunu paralı asker olalım diye almadık corpo iken şirketçi bir gaspçı oynamak isterken 30 dakika içinde ne yaparsak yapalım arasaka şirketinden kovulmaya mecbur bırakıldık, nomadken vasıfsız şekilde şehre indik daha 1 saat olmuş klanımızdan ayrılmışken, veyahut sokak çocuğu olduk zaten herkes bi nevi sokak çocuğu oluyo ama işte daha yeni tanıştığımız biriyle sıkı fıkı olduk.

SPOIL BİTTİ
Gelelim Hikayemizin ilerleyişi ve CD PROJECT Red'in oyun bitirtme takıntısına.
 İlk olarak bunu söylemeliyim ki oyunda sadece ana görev yaparsanız 20 saatte bitiyor fakat siz oyunun sadece 3'te 1'ini oynuyorsunuz. Oyunun diğer sonlarını görmek istiyorsanız belirli karakterlerle yan hikayeyi ilerletmelisiniz bu şekilde tam 6 endinge ulaşabilirsiniz diyebilirim spoiler vermeden.
 Oyunun ilerleyişi konusu: Oyunun tercihlerimizi önemsemediği openingi geçersek bundan sonra kalan 10-15 saatlik kısımda bazı yerlerde çok etkili bazı yerlerde de ehh işte dedirten bir rpg elementi bulunmakta açıkçası burda da Wicher 3'e benzettim gerçi o oyunda rpg yoktu ama işte anladınız siz. Belirli bir kısma kadar oyunu değiştiriyor fakat sonrası muamma neyse hikayemiz enfes yan görevler ile gayet iyi ilerliyor bazı yan görevlerin 
bazı ana görevlerden daha hoş olduğunu farkedeceksiniz.(Enfes yan görevler var) 
 Gelelim CD PROJECT Red'in takıntılarına abi adamlar Witcher 3'ün ana senaryoyu bitirme yüzdeliğini az bulmuşlar ve ""Hey adamım benim oyunumu bitir diye yaptım bitir lütfen"" der edasıyla ana hikayede ki bazı yerleri yan görevler kısmına aktarıyor.Bu yüzden oyunun ana senaryosu bu kadar kısa sürüyor olarak açıklayabilirim. 
 Oyunun -'leri ve +'ları (İnceleme tarihi-3.01.2021)
 OYUNDAKİ EKSİKLER:
-Oyunda yapay zeka diye bir şey yok.
-Oyunda bir etkimizin olduğu çok nadir anlaşılıyor.(Genel olarak hissettiğim son görevdi)
-Şehir dolu ama ruhsuz şehrin merkezinde insanlar en azından bir şeylerle uğraşırken diğer kesimlerde ve sokaklarda karakterler sadece bir yerden bir yere gidiyor.. zamanla düzeleceğini düşünüyorum.
-Haritamız araba veyahut motor sürerken çok basık ani driftler atmak zorunda kalıyoruz çünkü saliselerle nereye dönmemiz gerektiğini gösteriyor.
-Zamanında kıyafetlerimiz oyunda ki tercihlerimizi etkileyecek derken hiçbir etkisini görmedim aksine maymun gibi dolaşıyorduk etrafta işte şu iyi şunu giyeyim şu daha iyidir vs vs
-Witcher 3'te olduğu gibi oyun ilk çıktığında oyunda mekanlar vs eksikti aynısı bu oyunda da var yüz hatlarımızı ve cinsiyetimizi değiştirebiliceğimiz yerler ve berber gibi tramvay gibi yerler şuanlık eksik.
-Oyunun başında gayet zorlanırken oyunun ortasında allah gibi oluyoruz.(Oyunu zorda oynamama rağmen oyunun yarısında herkese hack ile tek atmaya silah ilede tek atmaya başlamıştım.)
-Oyun ağzına kadar bug ve glitchle dolu.
-Oyunda lifepathlerin karşıdaki kişinin neci olduğunu anlama veya tehdit etmek dışında hiçbir anlamı yok.

OYUNDAKİ ARTILAR:
+Aynı witcher evreninde olduğu gibi bir evreni sadık bir şekilde kurguluyor sunuyorlar.(Cyberpunk bir frp oyunudur 2000li yıllardan beri)
+Oyunun combat kısmı combat derkende sadece silahlar değil içinde hack ve gizlilikte bulunuyor. Gayet iyi işlendiğini düşünüyorum.
+Araçlar her birine özenle çalışıldığı çok belli tabii burada sadece 1 şeyi iyi yapan gta 5'in araba hissiyatıyla karşılaştırmayacağım, cyberpunk 2077 oyununa göre gayet tatmin edici bir sürüş mekaniğine sahip olduğunu düşünüyorum.
+Anlattığı evrenin hikayesine ve karakterlerine gayet sadık kaldığını düşünüyorum.Her bir sonun birbirinden farklı olması beni şaşırttı ve mutlu etti.
+Oyunun 1. şahış olması gayet yerinde bir tercih olmuş şahsen 3. şahısta olsaydı bu kadar kapılırmıydım evrene orası bir soru işareti.
+Karakter gelişimleri karakterlerin gerçekten günbegün değiştirdiğini hissettim.
+Sohbet menüsü gayet hoş olmuş panele girmeden bile insanlarla iletişim kurmak kolay ve kullanışlı olmuş.

Ve son olarak...
 Hoşçakal V, asla vazgeçme.


First of all, sorry for my bad England(kekw), I used the translation for the review.

Yes, let's start with a long adventure that will be the best game in the world, while leaving early with radical decisions and having to be the best game.. this will probably be the best game in the world in 2 years, I'm counting on it, let's start the review anyway.
Our story begins with Saburo Arasaka's father in the 1900s, shaped by Richard night's Coronado City dream in 1993. at the age of 27, we set foot in the world in memory of Richard Night 1998, who was killed by the arasakalar attack, and in memory of V (female-August 12, 2049 / male-June 10, 2049).
Night city, already one of the few cities, is also one of the first 3 cities where life is terrible when the limited rich live like the very rich poor, because the city does not go as Richard Knight took shape.
As a mercenary, we embark on a breathtaking adventure in which our main goal is to be legendary while deciding on some things on our journey.

SPOILER ALERT.    I could not skip here Because as a mercenary in this game, if you are a corporate company, no matter what we do when we come to the city after about 30 minutes, nomads, our clan or unskilled, not everyone will want to play the game of grabbing just to search for street children, we have already left the street child after more than 1 hour, but we had to be fired from the company with someone we met here.

SPOILER OVER
Let's move on to the progression of our story and CD Project Red's obsession with finishing the game.
First, I have to say that if you only perform the main task in the game, it will end in 20 hours, but you only play 1 out of 3 games. If you want to see other endings of the game, you need to advance the side story with certain characters, so I'd say you can get to the full 6 endings without spoilers.
Game Progress theme: the game doesn't care about our preferences after 10-15 hours in some places, very effective in some places ehh here is an rpg element that clearly says I liken it to wicher 3, but there was no rpg in this game, but here you understand. This turns the game into a specific piece, but still after the puzzle, our story goes well with exquisite side quests, some side quests
you will notice that some basic tasks are more enjoyable.(There are exquisite side quests) let's move on to the CD Project Red's obsessions, where brother guys found Witcher 3 less than the percentage of finishing the main script, and say, ""hey, man, I did it to finish my game, please finish it.""it transfers some of the places in the main story to the side missions section.That's why I can explain the main scenario of the game in such a short way. 
+ AND - (review date-3.01.2021)
Review came more read more below LOL

--- https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page ---"
1609710166,"This game is below my expectation and got a lot of bug, but i still love game. (mostly because of keanu reeves)"
1609710166,"Bugs are not even biggest issue this game has. Game is not finished. A lot of the features, mostly RPG mechanics, are poorly implemented and might as well not exist.

Expanding upon RPG mechanics. The skills are mediocre. The variety of cyberware is depressing. In game characters talk about upgrades such as camo skin, extra skull lining, nanofiber skin etc., but apparently such upgrades does not exists in game. Street cred might as well not exist and that would have no effect on gameplay at all.

Story is pretty good, though."
1609709987,You can pet the cat
1609709926,12/10 Just the game of the fucking year !!!
1609709911,10/10 had no issues with the game
1609709880,good
1609709833,I won't settle for less. Improve the game and give us the cut content that we deserve.
1609709808,"It's buggy. Plain and simple. However, despite all it's bugs and game quitting issues, I am thoroughly enjoying my time in 2077."
1609709787,"I wish the general public didn't rush the creators to release this game because its so incredible but very buggy at the moment. I'm not blaming the creators at all because they wanted to take more time in order to make the game run smoother and fix bugs throughout it but because they weren't given that time here we are. I adore this game and think it's an incredible idea with such immense detail, I just wish they weren't forced to release it before they were ready."
1609709741,Fun to play on pc. not nearly as many bugs as in ps4 of xbox1 would recommend!
1609709660,boobs!
1609709636,Easily the best game I've played in years.
1609709590,"Only consoletards are complaining, thats their fault for trying to run a 2020 game on a doorstop. 

Good game runs fine on RTX3070 , RTX off and medium settings will see 4K@60fps just fine. Story is good and side mission interesting. Yes it has some bugs but its nowhere near Bethesda standards."
1609709445,This game is great couldn't be more happy with it. I've read and heard so many different things both positive and negative and thought to myself eh why not give it a try ( Thank you stimulus check lol ).. Long story short Game is great don't take someone else's word for it. I suggest trying it yourself you may like it and those who are making the bad reviews are basing the game on their interests and opinions..
1609709374,cool guns and i can be gay 10/10
1609709374,
1609709341,"The game as it is right now (post patch 1.6) is not a bad one, I would rate it 6/10, it's just mediocre in so many aspects.

The problem is that it didn't deliver what was promised. And that's why I'm giving it a thumbs down despite the fact I spent 88 hours in the game and for most of the part I kind of enjoyed it.

There has been many things said about the game, so I will keep it short.

The Good:
 - Graphics. You can spend hours just making photos of the city.
 - Side stories (there are like 4 or 5)
 - The City immersion when you just walk around.

The Neutral:
 - Main story
 - Gun play / RPG elements

The Bad:
 - Open world RPG - it's not. This game is much closer to RDR2. Action adventure would be a better term.
 - The City Immersion when you do anything else other than walk around.
 - Replayability - it's Action adventure with RPG elements. You can try some different builds, but soon you find out how shallow this game is.
 - Bugs

Worse than bad, The Absolutely Unacceptable:
 - Itemization. Like WTF!?
 - Cyberware system, crafting, housing, car / character customization ... well, basically any system in this game is so shallow, dumb, poorly done or straight non-existent. Everything feels so unfinished, cut, basic.
 - Lies from CDPR

Well, The story missions, characters, animations and actors are great. That's what I enjoyed. But as an RPG? Nope."
1609709299,"Definitely a fun game to play but it is full of bugs, game crashes every so often, there are major progression bugs also... This game needed at least one more year of development before launch. Such a shame because the story and visuals are fantastic but the bugs are so many that you end up more frustrated than satisfied. This game is a lot more incomplete than when Witcher 3 came out."
1609709271,"Runs fine on my pc not a lot of glitches or bugs, and zero game breaking bugs so far.
The story is gripping, interesting and very exciting.
Night City is very well put together and fun to explore

My only complaint really is that it is rather short for an RPG like this.
My first playthrough was around 45hrs and I didn't rush through it at all. 
The Witcher 3 for example took me way longer to complete. 
"
1609709265,gg m8
1609709157,No bugs/clitches so far !
1609709153,Great game. Was afraid they would ruin it by bringing cyberpunk to the video game world. Very happy with the game. Of course I would like to see a few other things added and changed a bit for my preferences but it is already a monster size of a game. Combat and driving is great and skill selection is well done when leveling up. Happy I purchased this game at release. Patches are really helping out with the little glitches.
1609709105,just a little buggy also might explode your pc
1609709089,Awesome game! Best game of 2020 for sure.
1609709048,"Game is playable, story is good, but just too much immersion breaking bugs. In addition, there is one bug to the ""Imagine"" side gig that involves a monk and a BD that crashes and shuts off my pc (happened in my two game playthroughs), which I would consider literally game breaking.

As mentioned previously, some immersion breaking bugs are:
-Doors not opening
-Cars/motorcycle not moving
-Can't run/stuck in walking mode
These three were the first to come to mind and the most annoying of the bugs requiring a full restart. There are other bugs that can be annoying too, but at this time I do not recall them.

Lastly, not sure if its my cpu (amd) or my 3 year old gpu (amd), but when I start playing the game (at high/ultra settings), I start off with decent fps (~80-90) but after a long session, the frames dip in low range fps (~30-50), which then would require a restart of game to actually go back to the higher frames. 

Played the game from start to finish one time, and played second play through to about 75%. Both playthroughs are on max difficulty."
1609709047,"This is a masterpiece of a game imo, with bugs (that will surely be patched). Lots of great moments, cool characters and an imersive and interactive world. Not super satisfied with the endings (played em all, even the ""secret"" one), however we'll see what the dlc's have to offer when they appear. This game is almost as good as Wild Hunt, and that speaks volums to alot of people i recon. Highly recommend this, it helps if you got a high end pc, runs smooth on ultra/w some raytray."
1609709007,"I couldn't play it for more than 30 minutes at a time before the game crashed back to the desktop. I couldn't recommend this game in good conscience. Not at any price. I'm writing this review after having attempted to play version 1.06. I had attempted CD Project Red's automated suggested solutions, updated my drivers, applied OS updates. Nothing had helped. 8 hours after purchase I requested a refund."
1609709004,:(
1609708983,"You know that uncle that no one talks about in the family? He made A's in school, had a job before he was 16 and payed off his first car before 21? Well now he is facing 26 years for vehicle manslaughter."
1609708963,"Aim for the moon, land among the stars!"
1609708945,best game 2020 hands down. pick it up if your rig can handle it
1609708921,pog
1609708942,"There were lots of promises made but ultimately CDPR under delivered. I was quite disappointed that so much of what was promised over the years did not materialize. 

While CDPR has managed to create a beautifully detailed open world, it lacked the depth in ways I can interact with. The main story and some side missions were really awesome, but beyond that I didn't really find any reason to explore Night City. It looks like a lot had to be cut out from the original development plan and it really shows. To be fair, Cyberpunk 2077 is still a decent game that I would absolutely recommend to anyone. Night City it still tells a great story that I think was one of the best delivered in video games.

Yes, the game was less in scope than what I had imagined, but I got over that pretty quickly. What really killed my excitements was the fact that the game shipped unpolished. There were just too many issues that broke the immersion during my gameplay. Objects frozen and fixed in the air, people/cars disappearing, frequent crashes... these are just a tiny fraction of what I experienced during my gameplay.

I really wish I had waited a bit before playing through this game because the story and presentation of the game was really amazing. I wish I could have experienced the awe without interruptions from bugs and crashes.

The game is expected to receive some major patches over the next couple of months, which should fix a lot of the issues that are currently in the game. Do buy the game. After they actually ""finish"" the game. Do yourself a favor and experience the game the way you deserve.

1609708859,bit buggy sometimes but still really enjoyable
1609708793,"Buggy as hell and required multiple reloads throughout the game. Not for the impatient. 
But other than the glitching across the map because you jumped on a car, and T-posing characters every once and while.
You can see what creators wanted to make. Its beautiful visuals when its not buggy, and the side quest flesh out the city and the lore. Every apartment and mission you do you can get a story that isn't just copied and pasted but created. You can create multiple books on all the logs you find and some of them leave you to secrets or give you hints to certain ways to go about missions. And without a doubt the issue isn't with the world but rather the software the creative team was forced to use. Get past the software and its many glitches from unfinished work and you get a beautiful world the likes of Skyrim and GTA. 
The game is Good and sometimes Great, But it could have been the Best. And that cannot be forgiven, like shooting Great Painter in the middle of his Magnum Opus."
1609708739,"Great main story, combat, huge open city that is full of side quests that are actually interesting and fun to complete as is exploring in general. Take note Ubisoft, this is how you do a open world game. Will only get better with more patches although my playtime so far I've been hampered by very few bugs. 

"
1609708706,I've enjoyed my time playing the game no complaints
1609708678,"It was good for the entire 150 hours I played it.

I just wish it wasn't so darn buggy right now. It's so close to amazing rather than just great.

Wait like half a year if you can avoid spoilers and/or have a lower end rig."
1609708583,"Its a great game that has issues like any other. if given more time these issues will most likely be resolved which is already being proven. 

I would like to note that none of these issues is exactly game breaking. mostly just texture pop ins and maybe spawn glitches every now and again. 

i have enjoyed upgrading my character and weapons, exploring the map and doing side missions so much that i have cleared half the map of them. its very fun with interesting ways to go about completing them. 

i do wish there was more ways to earn money but im sure thats planned for the future of the game. 

in short, its a great game that with a chance can become addictive and enjoyed."
1609708578,"I absolutely love this fucking game minus the bugs and glitches in the game which for me are very minor but besides that game play is fucking amazing, story is really intriguing. Me personally am at a loss for words for this game its everything I wanted it to be. If they fix the bugs and shit like that the game would be a lot better but I am enjoying the game so no complaints here"
1609708463,It is fun but i would wait untill the next hot fix. The game runs well but alot of the game feels unpolished. However I haven't encountered bugs too often
1609708267,"In its current state, game is ridden with bugs, there is no immersion to speak of, world just doesn't react to you in almost any way and the AI is...lackluster to say the least.
HOWEVER, I still recommend this game, when everything worked I was having a blast and the story experience alone is worth your money. If you aren't in a hurry, maybe wait a year or two until GOTY edition comes out before buying it, otherwise even despite its shortcomings, the game still is money well spent in my opinion."
1609708242,"This game is a clear recommendation. And for me it even made the GotY. 

But let me dive a little deeper. 
Cyberpunk was a long awaited game for me, having followed the idea for the last four games. I saw the game being postponed again and again until it finally released a few weeks ago. 
Since then, I developed a slight addiction to it. 
Here are my pros and cons. 

Cons: 
The cons are existent, as sad as it is to say. See, Cyberpunk was not yet ready to be released. Whatever the reason for that was, I don't know. However I can say that the game is performing below expectations. With a 2080ti, overclocked to almost the limit, I still see drops in my framerate every so often. Especially upon entereing highly crowded areas, this becomes visible. 
There are also a lot of bugs that exist, from infinite money glitches, over broken quests all the way to glitching NPC's. The list for these is VEEEEERY long. I am yet to encounter any glitch that makes the game unplayeable. 
Everything I have seen was annoying at times, yet most of the time, these glitches just led to funny moments. 

These two, performance and glitches are really my main cons. 
We will have to wait for a bit, but I firmly believe CDPR will fix them in the next few months. 

My pros on the other hand can be simply listed, but I shall add a small explanation anyway. 

Gameplay: It feels incredible. Every weapon you use, every build you make in this game gives you other options. (playíng an SMG build is still quite similar to an AR build, in case you were wondering). 
From a Netrunner(Hacker) build, over a run-and-gun style build, or even an up close and personal baseball bat. All of these are incredibly fun and change the overall gameplay massively. You can even choose to go entirely non-lethal if you want to. 
The cars in the game are evenly fun and various. They all feel different from each other when driving, and the all look AMAZING. 

Graphics: Not much to say here. Raytracing and DLSS at their very best. Beautiful city with that amazing cyberpunk style that makes this game so much more special. 

Story. 10/10. The story of V will draw you in as you experience Night city through her/his eyes. The people you interact with feel like actual humans and in almost every quest, you can choose to do or not do certain things, which may or may not impact the outcome. 
Even with the very dramatic main story(which I wont spoil here) completed, you can still enjoy sidequests. Here you can build new relationships that will influence your later game and ending(obviously). 

Love of detail: 
This is something I myself appreciate a huge lot. You can find easter eggs from all kinds of games in Night city, some smaller, some so massive you shouldnt even be able to oversee them. And if you look at everything, you will see that the CDPR devs put all their heart into creating this game. That is really rare these days, and knowing it makes the game feel even more alive. 

Two sentences to finish(So you don't actually have to read the rest of my review) 

This game is absolutely worth it. Beyond the bad publicity and the botched start lies a gem as pure and potent as sunlight. 

Thank you to the team of CDPR that allowed me to experience this. 
(I also blame you for my addiction tho)"
1609708239,BEST GAME EVER
1609708087,"Reviewing this game after approximately 60 hours of gameplay, doing both main story and side missions.

This game is a great RPG... or it would be, if it was finished. The game plays (with some occasional immersion breaking bugs) much as you would expect, but lacks the final polish of a completed RPG (especially compared to other CDPR games).

Story points feel rushed, many gameplay concepts play out half baked (Police officers teleporting to you if you commit a crime, even in the middle of nowhere) and UI has some really obnoxious quirks, like popouts getting stuck onscreen and the *entire game freezing* when you do something as basic as eat a consumable from the menu.

Unless you're willing to play the game with an open mind and ignore it's flaws, wait 7-10 months, buy this game when it's on sale and the problems are fixed."
1609707984,"It's buggy and glitchy, and there was a lot more promised over the years that haven't been added, but I still really enjoy this game.

There is a HUGE city to explore, and it's visually very good looking. Even poorly optimized it looks beautiful.

The story is deep, and there were a few moments I really felt for the characters I was helping, I'm no ashamed to say there were a few parts I squirted out a tear or two.

Highly recommend."
1609707972,despite all the bugs and problems (only minor ones in my case) its one of the best games ive ever played
1609707957,"Completed the game several times, Its a fun game the first time you play it! but I cant help but feel like this game is boring once you've finished the main quest and side missions. It's about as much an RPG game as halo is...like for reals. And about as linear as true crime streets of LA. 

Looking back at the 48min game play reveal of this game...its like we got a totally different game. Trauma team was a missed opportunity, Meredith Stout was basically pointless. Adam Smasher fight was such a let down! for the size of the guy...a few swings of a katana and that's it!. The police have cars...yet they don't chase you (for reals! you just run away and don't stop running for a few sec and all the stars disappear). Gangs don't chase after you after you kill a few of them,. they just stand at the side of the road and that's it.

No real industry game changing things in this game, doesn't matter what background you go for or what dialog you go for...end result is the same. The only time you can make a decision that does effect the game in any way...the game ends that's it. Like you don't know what happens after it...just finishes and that's it.

Honestly the game felt rushed, 7-8 years of development but the game still feels like its a beta or something. The city feels dead, the NPC's are dead. the combat AI is basically numb and doesn't really offer anything amazingly new. Aside from the cut content or lack of content. The game is fun but I'm very disappointed. It's not an RPG game I'd say it's an open world action adventure game. 

No car customisation, can't change the characters appearance in the game or change the body shape or anything. You can change the private parts when you make your character...Like what's the point of that? It doesn't benefit the game play in any way.

The romance options don't add anything to the game...they don't assist you during missions or add anything to the game. missed alot of wasted opportunities in this game...feels more like a bad DLC then an actual game. 

I'd wait for Cyberpunk online (if that even exists) or GTA 6 for a proper open world game.  This game was an overpriced DLC...a good DLC but a DLC none the less. wouldn't recommend this game in its current state with all the cut content, bugs and lack of immersion from an ""RPG"" game."
1609707925,"This is a great game. The story, the vibes, and the experience were all top knotch. This is the first game since Skyrim or Mass Effect where I turned out all the lights, got so coffee and immersed myself since Mass Effect\ Skyrim. Even with the bugs the experience is was still overwhelmingly good. I had one moment where the bugs were difficult to ignore during a boss fight, but besided that the good outways the bad. I think back to all of the bethesda games and how buggy they all were and still are to this day. The game has style and quirkiness, for example, I spent 14 minutes talking to a vending machine AI. It was great. Just play the game and ignore the reviews. Single player games are a personal experience and subjective, I loved the game."
1609707899,The game is a little buggy but nothing game breaking other than that its probably one of the best RPGs ive ever played 10/10 would recomend
1609707872,Until they fix this piece of shit don't buy it save ur self some money
1609707863,"Is the game perfect? No.
Is it worth full price? No. 
Do I plan to keep playing for many hours? Yes.
"
1609707827,Great game!
1609707826,"Great game. Even though the game has many bugs, the main storyline is amazing and definitely is worth playing through."
1609707734,"I wish I could like this game. Obviously, the glitches make this almost unplayable. It's extremely immersion breaking and happens way too often. 

You can tell the beats of the story are definitely there and the character building is great. Ultimately, this game has too much bloat that it distracts from the best parts of it. My ending made basically no sense and I didn't like that I had no say in how it finished. That was a let down. I guess that describes this whole game, a let down. I really wanted to love it. And I definitely did in some parts, but as a whole I just can't love it."
1609707683,"Now that I have played this game to the end for the very first time, I can say with confidence that this is not a bad game, nor is it particularly good either. The game's story and writing doesn't feel like it was from a team of 43 writers, but instead it feels like it was written by a small group of 14 year olds, trying to make an actually good story, without any knowledge of how to do that. The gameplay mechanics, such as driving, shooting, interacting with NPC's were mostly enjoyable, with the exception of melee combat making me feel like I was playing Skyrim all over again. The collision physics were also questionable at times, such as when driving at high speeds and bumping into another car, and the other car simply going over you without a scratch on either of you, or you or a NPC getting horribly misaligned during a scripted scene. The strange behaviour of NPC's would have been comical, were it not happening at all times, during combat, during scripted and emotional scenes and completely ruining them, or just walking down the street. If you are given the chance to not buy this game, then take it, and wait for another year, and hope that it gets improved in that time."

1609707639,gg
1609707609,games playable yo
1609769855,Gud game
1609707517,"Just search for ""DID THEY LIE? Features Missing From Cyberpunk 2077"" on Youtube and try not to think about what this game could have been.
It is sad that everyone is only talking about the bugs and poor performance and not about everything else they lied about.
They said that your choices matter. That is not true.
There aren't any real consequences throughout the game and the ending basically decides in the last 30 minutes or so.
Absolutely no replay value in my opinion because the ""lifepaths"" are only different from each other in the first 10 minutes of the game. After that it is basically always a ""Streetkid"" V with a couple of different dialog options which all lead to the same outcome.
Option 1: ""Yes!"", Option 2: ""Yes."", Options 3: ""Something completely different but YES"".

I do regret paying 60€ for this game, even with the 130h in it."
1609707514,crashes way to often
1609707502,"Obviously buggy, and needs optimization for consoles; but the devs did a great job with character development and (despite holes in AI and stuff that's been clearly gutted) it's a fantastic game and I can't wait for the updates and DLC"
1609707466,"buggy but fun, if you enjoy decent writing and like playing skyrim and doing side missions n' shit you'll probably enjoy it, literally skyrim with technology, although its endings are better than skyrim"
1609707386,"Yes it has some bugs ,  but its excellent otherwise .   Fun gameplay , aweseome story"
1609707312,"Bugs be damned, it's a damn fun world to hang out in, which is the primary feature of any open world game."
1609707296,grapics card runnin at 100% :)
1609707272,"100%'d the game, still have stuff left to test. Taken on its own, the game is OK.
When compared to what it [i]could[/i] have been, though? Hard 'no' from me. I will maybe change the review to a more positive one, when/if all the annoying bugs are fixed, and cut content is restored in one form or another."
1609707131,"Awesome game with an awesome story.

Additionally, while all the people giving the game negative reviews were right for it, many hotpatches have come out since then, and most, but not all, of the bugs have been patched at this point."
1609815705,crashes very often
1609711747,"This game is frustrating. It could be great, but it is still broken as of 1.06. All those bugs you see in the memes... you will see in game... I mean ALL of them; they happen all the time. It's a broken mess.

The AI is absolute trash. What is worse is that you get a sniper rifle that shoots through ALL obstacles; and they just stand far away not engaging you.

The physics make no sense... like it's shocking how terrible they are. This ""living world"" is fake; nothing you do changes anything. You die randomly from stepping in the wrong place... You fall through the map... Items get glitched and cannot be picked up... Your shadow looks horrifyingly bad... 

The police; I almost forgot about the police... what a joke... GTA has been doing wanted levels properly for decades; this game is pathetic - they spawn behind you; and you run away for like 10 seconds and you are clear.

No wonder CDPR stock has tanked so hard - I  don't know how they went from Witcher 3 to this garbage... I wanted to like it, but the more I play it the worse it gets... The itemisation is woefully inadequate; virtually no variation - unlike Borderlands which is epic.  If you want a better shooter play Borderlands; if you want better open world play GTA... This game does nothing right."
1609706754,is good
1609706727,"Ignore the angry internet troll sheep calling out bugs and other nonsense. Game was rushed mostly because of the same people complaining all the time. In my 85 hours of gameplay, the only bugs i experienced was insta death due to issues in platforming, and a single immortal npc. Due to autosave, both were a minor inconvenience.  

The game is fine. Its more like Witcher 2 quality rather than witcher 3. 
-Graphics are beyond amazing if u got the rig to run it. 
-Optimization is fine, ran the game at medium/high 2560x1440p, resulting in about 45-55 average fps. But even at 40-45 fps the gameplay looks smooth which is awesome. 
-Plot is fine, i feel the main story was a bit rushed and could be finished rather quickly
-Fun side quests and lots of map minor challenges/etc
-Driving is actually nice, manoeuvrability depends on the car you're driving
-OST is awesome, especially the Samurai stuff 
-Romance is kinda meh, not much choice and related content falls kinda short 
-Very easy game, pretty much the same as Witcher. I feel the same playing both games on their hardest difficulties. The game pushes you a bit hard in the beginning, and then u become a god in the middle and can pretty much one shot everything that moves by the end. 

TL'DR- Game will be a solid 8/10 after they're done patching it up. I think full price is fine, but sweet spot would be at 10-20% discount. Worth it and CDP deserves it after enduring all the twitter kyles and karens."
1609706620,"It is true, this game does have a lot of bugs. Some of which do annoy me to no ends, but others provide silly fun. Besides the bugs, the story line isn't overly drawn out, but if you feel it is too short you can do side quest which are done very well."
1609706565,FPS goes brrrrrrrr...
1609706533,i dont care what reviewers say - I have aimbot guns and guns that shoot through walls in a game with a compelling story line - also worth every penny
1609706498,There are a few bugs and visual but the game play is great.
1609841167,"A unfinished resort. It has a beautiful lobby, rooms and landscaping. The staff is nice. But the pool is unfinished, and can only filled up to my knees. They only serve McDolands chicken nuggets and Powerade.... You get stuck all the time, lots of quest breaking issues. This might be your Disney world, but I would wait for major things to change. Simply too many issues to recommend, lots of noticeable cut content and poorly thought out systems. Plays like a beta. 2.5/5 Stars in its current state."
1609706234,"Look great, Lots to do this game is big."
1609706195,"Over the first few weeks, everything was fine. Sure there were some bugs here and there, but nothing terrible.  Story is great, both melee and ranged combat is pretty well done.  Over the last two weeks, however,  my game crashes every 30 seconds to 5 minutes.  I would love to play the game, but I just simply can't. My PC exceeds the specs, but opening menus, crafting, saving... all come with the risk of a crash.  I have to shut steam down, or the game still thinks its running. Every single time.  I held off on asking for a refund in hopes that patches could fix the problems, but this is ridiculous."
1609706118,Worst RPG game
1609706079,"Right now, there are many bugs and issues that affect the game on a technical level which can distract you from the gameplay and the experience itself. However, The storyline, the characters, and the voice actors do so much to carry the weight that holds the game down. The voice actors do a great job for each character, and each character has a unique personality that will invest you into their story. The story is rich and interesting, it is bound to leave you satisfied. When you really push away all the noise and the flashing lights, there are special moments that you have with characters where you just have a conversation about anything, and these are the moments I cherish and you probably will too. The best part about this game was Johnny Silverhand. Firstly, Keanu Reeves does a great job as a voice actor for this character, and secondly CD Projekt Red creates an amazing side kick and an intriguing character. CD Projekt Red does a great job making an arrogant, asshat of a dynamic character, as you move on with the story, you begin to sympathize with Johnny as we dive into his past, and as he realizes what kind of person he was back then.  There are many interesting side missions, specifically the ones with notable characters instead of jobs given by fixers. Besides the bugs and the glitches, my biggest gripe with the game are the driving mechanics. The steering seems delayed and sluggish, and also a lot of the cars tend to drift instead of turn, a big mistake on CD Project Red's part, as driving is your main mode of transportation for traveling. SPOILER: [spoiler]The last point I want to make is that the ending. I feel as some people may be unsatisfied with V ultimately dying, and I can understand that as I have built relationships with these characters that you pour hours into to, However it took me some time to really process that ending and I feel as it is appropriate, as not everyone will get their happy ending. In videogames, anime, movies, etc. we always see the good guy winning in the end, as we love that, but CD Projekt Red reminds us that we don't always get what we want. The real world is cruel and unforgiving, and we must fight and strive to do our best, or else we will be wiped out, as we are shown in Cyberpunk 2077. In the end, I chose temperance, which is quite possibly the best ending, but it is more like a lesser of three evils. The biggest stab in the heart was during the credits, when everyone that you created relationships with calls you, suspecting that you are alive, but you aren't. You are only an empty shell of what you used to be.[/spoiler]Given time (and updates), we will begin to see a better version of this game without the bugs and glitches that scare gamers soon fade away, and if you are willing to deal with those bugs right now, than I would recommend you buy this game. 

Overall: 7/10"

Melee: Polsihed compared to games of similar style.

Driving: Clunky but still fun.

[h1]Pros: [/h1]

[h1]“Meh” (interesting features that are not fully realized or satisfying to utilize):[/h1]

[h1]Summary: [/h1]

Cyberpunk is a good game if you focus on its strengths. Those strengths in my opinion are its narrative and the world that it presents you. As you play through its narrative and participate in the side missions/ gigs though you will interact with several systems/ design philosophies that might disappoint you depending on your preferences.
The build system leaves a lot to be desired. I love the customization, but I feel that by the time you can take advantage of your build’s potential, you are overpowered and might as well just run-in like a madman.

The crafting and loot systems are not fun to utilize in my opinion. You are there picking up 5-6 guns per fight, and you can either visit a shop or disassemble them. If I disassemble the gear then I am forced to interact with the game’s looting system, which I must unlock perks for before taking full advantage of. If I do not go that route, then I must stop what I am doing to visit a shop, breaking my momentum. Or I can just leave the loot there. Towards the end of my campaign, I was just tired of picking up loot. If a game introduces systems you do not feel encouraged to use, I think that’s missing your potential.

Combat is serviceable. The gun-play is solid, the abilities make things interesting. Ultimately the enemy AI kind of dampens things for me, as when you realize that you can run in and massacre a group relatively easy and for just about the same prize you lose the motivation to approach combat differently.

Aside from the narrative missions, the side missions, and the world, you are not given much else to do in that world. I think of games like GTA San Andreas where you can steal a cab and do a “Crazy Taxi” style side job. Or the Witcher 3 where you can play Gwent. That area this game comes up short, not even presenting the option to race unless for several side missions.

To wrap this up, Cyberpunk 2077 is a very good game. If you are a narrative focused player and love the Cyberpunk aesthetic in general, I do not think this game will disappoint you much. I would say drop your expectations a bit and you will find yourself a solid game. Does it meet the hype? In my opinion not even close, it never gave me those Witcher 3 or Skyrim moment if I am being honest. The narrative did tug at my heart strings a bit and the world is easy to get lost in and immersed when not being taken out of that immersion by a bug or dumb AI. I would recommend waiting for a sale unless you are looking for a solid story and a world to get lost in right away."
1609705038,"great game cant wait for the quality of life stuff and dlc
:)"
1609704939,"Playing on a RTX2070 with minimal bugs (nothing game-breaking). Very happy with the game overall, and excited to see the game grow better with each patch (just like Witcher 3 did)."
1609704893,"if you have fairly up to date hardware then this wont be an issue for to play.
I like it a lot more than Deus Ex Machnica."
1609704886,"I guess I'll start by saying that the console version not working is unacceptable and that should be fixed asap. That's not what my thoughts here are referring to. My one sentence review would be ""If you have a decent PC then this game is definitely worth it."" That being said I'll list the rest of my thoughts below. This is how I feel after 30 hours. i'm almost done with the main story.

Tech Stuff/Graphics: Cyberpunk had a bit of a PR nightmare surrounding its launch. I watched a lot of reviews after it came out and there were a lot of valid complaints. I admittedly don't understand any frames per second/ray-tracing jargon a lot of the more tech savvy people reviewers throw around. I let the computer decide what was acceptable in that area and the game looked fantastic. The game never crashed and any bugs I encountered did not affect the flow of the game. I did hear of a bug that may delete all of my progress once the save file is bigger than 8 MB, but as of now that hasn't happened. (If it did happen I'd be pretty upset)

Story: I'm the kind of guy who skips the story in 90% of video games I play. I find it harder to care about the story as I get older because I don't have much time to play games. But in this game I was unable to bring myself to skip the story because its really good. Its like watching a really good Netflix series. There is an interesting cast of characters and you get to make a lot of meaningful choices. There were also plenty of opportunities for your character's build to affect the outcome of conversations. I keep getting caught up in side quests because there are so many characters I want to know more about. The story is probably the best thing Cyberpunk has going for it. 

Gameplay: Cyberpunk reminds me a lot of the Fallout/Elder Scrolls games. If you like those games you'll definitely like this. One gripe I have in any game like this is the insistence on me sneaking around. I like to go in guns blazing, but being sneaky always seems to be the default. It irks me when I get a ""NICE GOING IDIOT!"" for playing the way I want to play. (This isn't specific to Cyberpunk, a lot of games are guilty of this) The quick hack system allows for some fun combat. I like poisoning guys, blowing up stuff or any other havoc I could cause mid combat. I played a sub-machine gun/blades/quick hack build which ended up being really fun. I also enjoyed wandering around the world. There were a lot of ads, people, places, and decor that culminated in the game being pretty immersive. It all felt pretty plausible. I felt like the driving was pretty clunky compared to other games I've played, but I'm generally a bad video game driver. There were also a lot of ""brain dance"" editing sequences which got old. I would have to find a particular item/sound which wasn't immediately obvious and they wont let you continue without finding it. It really slowed the pace of the game a couple times. I am still having a lot of fun though and plan on finishing the game.  

Sound: The music was all really cool. I kept it on the smooth jazz station (Royal something or other) pretty much the whole game. There was a pretty cool black metal station (Ritual FM) too. I heard complaints about Keanu Reeves performance, but I thought it was totally fine. All of the voice acting was really well done. 

I hope this helps. I also hope whomever can't play the game, gets it fixed because it would be a shame to miss out on this one because of the terrible launch. I'm sure it will be 20 bucks and run great in a couple years, so waiting is a good option too."
1609704752,A c c i d e n t a l l y picked Angel and didn't pay attention until I was in the room. Fastest reload in the west.
1609704703,"Its not bad, not great either. Main story quests is the reason i recommend this. One side quest completely bugged out so i couldn't finish the game on 100% if i wanted to unless i start from early saves. 
I would say its worth 40$ at most in this stage."

Sadly, I can't recommend this game to anyone in its current state. The game experience is very unbalanced, excelling at few things, but failing horribly at others. I have very little hope for things like AI, physics and game mechanics to be improved with patches in the future, as it would need a complete rework.

The game could be worth playing for the story and beautifully designed Night City, but my suggestion is to wait for all the game breaking bug fixes to land first, and then wait for 30-50% sale. The game is not (and probably not going to be) worth more IMO.

1609704401," Cyberpunk 2077, the game surrounded by anticipation, delays and controversy.  I've managed to complete the game with over 100 hours played and have done just about everything you could do in the game, minus a few achievements that I missed because it was hidden, or didn't match my game style.  I want to start off by saying I was one of the people hyped by this game, like many others out there.  Everything that they promised early on I was truly expecting this to be a ground breaking one of a kind game.  Kind of like taking everything I've enjoyed from open world games and fps and mixing them with an awesome sci-fi (cyberpunk) universe.  The game though, fell short of those expectations and we were left with...well...an average game.

I'll start off by saying the game wasn't bad.  I enjoyed the universe and the story, otherwise I wouldn't of invested over 100 hours playing the game.  This isn't the worst game of the year like people are saying, but it's not the best game either.  I would say it's probably one of the biggest disappointments though.  I feel like the game had/has so much potential that it just wasn't full completed.  I do hope they continue to support the game and it's universe and further progress the story that was set in place.  I just hope they take their time with it and improve upon the things that people are complaining about.  This does have potential to be so much more than an average game, I just hope we get to see it.

TL/DR:
An average game with beautiful graphics that is fun to play if you can get past some of the bugs and qwerks.  It would be worth it to wait for it to go on sale or to have some of the bugs fixed before investing any money into the game."
1609704375,"Decent game. GTA with a high tech dystopian future backdrop. If you're looking for a solid cyberpunk genre game this isn't it- the main story is pretty loose and weak. Overall though the game is a hell of a lot of fun. Devs are doing a good job fixing bugs, though it still has quite a few, and it chews up and spits out strong graphics cards. Still, I'm having a lot of fun! The world is immersive, the side stories are really good, the gameplay is well done overall, and there are missions of every flavour. Would appreciate if they didn't just put a trans flag on Claire's truck without explicitly stating she's trans (maybe the DLC will fix that?) and a lot of the lesbian sex is uhhhhh very clearly written by straight men (excepting the night with Judy). I suspect once the kinks have been worked out this game is gonna stay a best seller for a long time."
1609704055,"In love with the world of cyberpunk, the city design, vehicle design, great characters. Disappointed with what got promised to us and teased at, but never made it to the final game. Poor game design choices like car meshes going low-quality as soon as you turn away. Pedestrians disappearing after you turn away. Brain dead civilian and police AI. What happened to ""coming: when it's ready?""

LOL

I love this game, but it could've have been the second coming of Jesus Christ if CDPR played their cards right."
1609703948,"CyberPunk 2077 is a Linear Action game with a mediocre story.
It was marketed as an openworld narrative driven RPG with consequence and story variation possibility.

This was a lie.

The Good: 
Night city is beautiful, the action ""can"" be pretty fluid and fun (when the AI Cooperate and you ignore the perks in the skill tree that LITERALLY boost things YOU CAN'T DO) 

The story is ""ok"" not bad, not amazing.

The Bad: 
CyberPunk has nothing to do in it's open world aside from visiting shop screens and 4 bumpfuzzy cut scenes that are mostly the same, the game gains nothing by being open world except inflated travel to get from linear quest to the next.

Bugs and poor game design plague the game, from disappearing crowds of mindless AI, who can't even drive cars in reverse or react to having a gun in their face aside from the old cower and run animations from witcher III, cars might just fall from the sky, quest triggers might just not happen, and the game might just make you naked. Random but repeatable garbage.

Finally, the marketing promised much more, I could bring up examples of cut content that was still being promoted in June, but a simple google search will provide pages of evidence. 

if you think to yourself $70 for 50 hours of bugs and an open world that is outclassed by grand theft auto 3 sounds like a good way to spend a weekend, go for it. Otherwise:
run.
RUN."
1609703821,its mint
1609703808,better have a decent card if you want to play with RTX ON
1609703804,"If you're still on the fence, then wait until summer 2021. Everything everyone is saying is true."
1609703793,"The visuals are amazing and if this is what things will look like going forward we are in a good place. They add some brand new game mechanics that I really enjoy. Overall I am very pleased. Just note, you need a good rig to get this to shine."
1609703748,"Such a depressing game, I want more.
PS don't pick Angel."
1609703719,"I really enjoy this game and think it is 1000x then any Ubisoft / Zenimax game. I personally have had no major problems with techinical problems, but likely avoided some getting this game on 1.06.

Best way to describe it is a slower, more thought out version of Borderlands. You have alot of tools at your disposal but you can easily just play it like borderlands and have a good time with the combat and city exploration. 

The world is easily the most detailed to explore since GTA V, a big step up from fallout's worlds. The world is still a step behind GTA but because of the futuristic setting, this offsets so of the blandness of the enviroments. Where it feels like every building in GTA was hand crafted, 1 in 5 feel hand crafted in this game. The world is a big step behind RDR 2 world, if chosing between this and Red Dead, I would suggest red dead first.

This is a big step forward when you compare it to say a typical assassins creed game, where once you enter a single building, you have essentially seen the entire game."
1609703701,"The game despite the bugs is great. Amazing storytelling and a very immersive intriguing setting. However unlike people say this isn't a new genre really, more like, it feels as if instead of sucking ass, this is what Deus EX mankind divided coulda been. The game feels like Deus EX human revolution became a giant open world story almost like that game had a baby with Grand Theft Auto.

Cyberpunk if you go into it expecting your brain to explode you will be disappointed. However if you go in just wanting to experience a good time and play the latest RPG to drop then yeah, it's worth the cash."
1609703583,"Yes there are glitches and problems with the game, but with the amount of complaining people were doing about not releasing the game this is what you get. So if you complained about the late release and don't like the game then shut up because it's partly your fault.

I have not found anything to suggest that i wasted my money. 

Great game that will just get better over time."
1609703557,"Easily the best game of 2020, while it was flawed and came with a decent number of bugs, the core gameplay and story was fantastic. It's a very strong and interesting narrative for the core storyline which is fully motion captured and voiced by some really good actors. But there's also a huge swath of side missions, many with their own interesting story arcs that don't just involve action but character building and fleshing out lore and backstory.

The setting and theme is beautifully imagined and brought to life with some of the best rendering technology the industry has to offer, playing on a RTX3080 with ray tracing enabled was visually stunning, I've never taken so many screenshots of in game locations in any other game, ever.

It has a really strong original OST not just for the in game radio but also very well done music to aid some of the more emotionally and impactful cutscenes. The sound is generally very good, a huge amount of dialogue fully voiced by the actors.

The role playing elements allow you to play your character however you want, you can be a gun totting maniac with rifles, shoguns, machine guns, grenades and alike. Or you can focus on stealth and non-lethal gameplay, sneaking around, choking out enemies, hiding bodies and not alerting anyone. Or you can build a more melee orientated character to be a tough brawler or use swords to get up close and personal. Not only is there a wide array of weapons, attachments, mods. But you can also mods your clothing, there's an entire implant section to increase the performance of your physical body so you can jump higher and install weapons and hacking tools. There's also an in depth hacking tree that allows a wide range of hacking devices in the world to your advantage. As well as a crafting tree to allow you to specialize in advanced technology weapons and crafting high level gear.

The game world itself has combat sections built with good use of both width, depth and height, there's a lot more verticality in this game than many FPS games, which means you can scale buildings and enter areas from many different angles through vents, windows, roof access. The areas are not linear so your approach can be different to take advantage of how you want to play and your strengths. There's a great many objects in the environment that alter game play, cameras and automated turrets can spot you but also be hacked to turn against the enemy, explosives and traps can be set in the environment to distract and eliminate enemies. All of this combined allows you to really play the game how you want to play it, and along with 3 unique origin stories it makes the game very replayable.

The downside is the game at launch was very buggy, 5 patches have already fixed a wide array of the more serious bugs, it's not likely you'll see anything game breaking, most of the bugs just harm immersion. The police system is basic and quite poor. Animations can sometimes be out of sync with objects in the world, physics can play up for some people. I may have been very lucky as my playthrough had very few bugs, especially considering how long the game is if you 100% a play through at nearly 200 hours for me. Some of the game world aspects make the game feel a little bit shallow or empty, it's much less of a sandbox game than something like GTA V is, it's more driven by the missions and narrative. if you focus on the story arcs and the missions then the experience is very good, but if you expect a more sandbox city to mess about with police and run around murdering everyone it's not really well suited for that.

The game has its fair share of faults but they're dwarfed by the underlying game being otherwise so impressive and fun to play, this is an easy 8/10 for me in its current state and could be an easy 9/10 when they fix some of the bugs. If the free DLC drops and adds in some of the missing or cut content which looks like it probably will, then it could be a 10/10. If you're in no rush for a new game then maybe wait for the patches in Jan/Feb before you buy, but right now it's still a great game and well worth the full asking price. I'd also advise running this on a decent PC, if you can get a hold of a new RTX video card that can handle ray tracing it'll really make the game shine, it's exactly the kind of killer app that can justify hardware upgrades."
1609703545,"looking past the soft locks, multiple bugs, and performance issues, this game is a real blast."
1609703514,awsome game
1609703502,"Come for the hype, stay for the stories, characters, and aesthetics.

This game should've been released a year from now, and it shows. The AI is dumb as rocks, the world lacks interactivity outside of missions, and glitches abound (mostly visual for me, but they were bad enough to be immersion-breaking). But if you're looking for a well-told and emotionally provocative story (aside from some pacing issues, likely due to cut content) then you'll enjoy the hell out of this game. There's missions and moments where these characters really felt like real people trying to survive in a dystopian future, people you actually give a damn about, and it really draws you in to this beautiful, fractured world and the people who populate it. That is, until you see 2D cars in the distance phasing in and out of existence or NPCs cowering for their life screaming ""they have a gun!"" because you took fall damage.

If CDPR gets their shit together and fixes all the issues and at least adds [i]some[/i] of the features they promised, this could be an easy 9/10+ game. But as it is, it's still an experience worth having."
1609703466,"yall need to quit giving cd projekt red a bad wrap because what i see is a group of amazing people who have a passion for developing adult game content and this game is truly something that is beautiful. maybe if the people that bash this game were not such immature little product snobs, crying like a grown baby when a project like this has a difficult situation, then maybe they would realize that these developers are human just like you and i, and that all of your complaining and whining and snobby attitude is what forced them to release it before they were comfortable with it. love you cd projekt red always have you are my actual favorite developers! NEVER CHANGE!!!"
1609703374,My biggest gripe about this game is that there is no flashlight
1609703343,im not even playing the game rn it's just saying its running when its not but cool game
1609703343,"While this requires a decent machine for graphics quality to be top notch, it is still worth checking out. Lot's to do, and many ways to customize your character."
1609703231,"Its a fun game, but GT5 looks and play much better. I really wish there was a 3rd person view."
1609703150,"Yeah this game is buggy,but this kind of things will get fixed.The story is very interesting and the gameplay is always fun.Sometimes it can get pretty frustrating but that just makes the experience challenging and a lot more wholesome.Its a great game :)))"
1609703029,"Rough around the edges but still one of the best games i've recently played. Motivating combat and perk system, beautiful and immersive world, relatable and interesting characters and an exciting mainstory and sidemissions."
1609703006,"Besides the bugs and performance issues, the game is pretty good. Hopefully once patched and they add more content (fingers crossed the stuff that was apparently cut originally) the game will be a 10/10."

1609702892,"A buggy, beautiful mess"
1609702866,lots of potential and i hope to see a lot of DLC for years to come.
1609702835,"After 225+ hours in the game, playing all 3 backgrounds, finishing every ending, and playing every side job, I give this a 3 out of 5 stars. It has so much potential that repeatedly falls short. It is a linear story driven FPS with some freedom of movement, not an open world RPG. Driving is horrible, it feels like rear steer vehicles that are all over the place, far from realistic to the point it is better to just quick travel everywhere. Every aspect of player and vehicle AI is horrible, most of the side quests are so short, or just cut off when it starts getting good. The Panam story and ending is the only good story/ending to the game, the rest are just patched together crap. Maybe the June 2021 full rewrite will make it better but until then, save your money."
1609702792,good graphics but some glitches need to be worked out still
1609702991,"Set in a dystopian future of American were the big corporations of the nation and the government of it, butt heads in war often...Created one of, if not, one of the most disappointing experiences I've ever had the displeasure to be apart of. Going into CDProject's new IP, I set the bar lower than most people did, not expecting a life changing experience, but at least one that can finish off the crappy year we all had to deal with until the next big game debuted. I don't need to go into detail of the glitches because they are literally on your twitter feed as you're reading this. 

So for starts, I can't even fathom the amount of useless content and mechanics that were shoved into this game. Your ""Life Path"" you get to pick at the beginning was promised to created a different experience for anyone that chose Nomad, while you pick Streetkid. Which is true, for the first 15-20 minutes of the game...and most dialogue you chose while talking to a npc, heck any npc, whatever you chose the ""Streetkid"" choice or the hacker intelligence choice of dialogue, changes 2% of your games outcome, while 98% of your choices, don't even matter, at least if the game is concerned it doesn't. Perks don't matter. To elaborate, the perk Human Shield shows a picture of someone holding a enemy, well as a human shield while putting a gun to their head, but the only time you can hold someone like that is in stealth. Meaning no one is shooting at you or looking your way so you have to make yourself known to the enemies and the best thing about it, is your not even holding a gun. The perk of course promised you that you can grab an enemy to your advantage during combat, and like always with this game, it doesn't deliver. 

Character customization, for how much detail was put into it, going down to the foreskin, literally, is so pointless that the game doesn’t even care to show a reflection your character through windows throughout the city, with the only way seeing your creation is by various mirrors the game sets up with most times, your character not showing up the way they look in your menus. And every cutscene is in first person, letting you see your character once or twice throughout the game unless you check every mirror the game allows you to check with most of them not letting you see. Driving is a whole other thing, in short it's funny, put in long terms, it feels so loose and choppy with you wrecking your sweet $215K hypercar you just grinded for, just for it to look like it belongs in a junkyard by not your fault, but the awful way the controls feel.

Another thing I wanted to touch up on was the world and combat. The world is huge, in massive scale, but what of let's say i don't know, Rockstar's GTA 5 which has about 90% of its map feel unused, which it is, but of what is used in that game, Cyberpunk utilizes none of it to feel like a true openworld. It seems dense going into it, just to leave you feeling like a hollow husk that tried to enjoy the game just as the game feels, shallow. Combat, oh man, the combat is amazing. It feels incredible for the fact that it absolutely fucking one note. Cover based, not like we have enough of those, has you hide behind various boxes, cars, ect, to not get pounded by the ridiculous damage output of the monkey brain, enemies that the game throws at you. Hacking isn't interesting enough to keep you engaged for the fact it allows any character to be a one shot. It just has you holding down tab, use your scroll wheel and press F to select your action for a bar to load to watch a enemy brain to get fried to a sludge like state, for the character model to flop on the ground and to immediately spring back up to a T pose to stare at the ground with a pistol in their hand. Stealth has you going up behind enemies and has the option to be lethal or non-lethal, which by the way, doesn't matter which route you take with non-lethal paths not rewarding those that chose that path, with the only thing given to them is the fixer assigning them the job telling them, ""I said to kill them,"" yet still giving you the reward. 

But the part that takes the cake, is the melee combat. Noticeably and unsurprisingly broken by everyone, gives us of what looks like, a failed attempt of a Lego Marvel Superhero stopmotion that features Sensei Wu from Ninjago and a 5.25 inch Master Chief figure, that was arranged by a 8 year old kid, filming with his iPad Air Mini 2 using iMovie. Camera work during the fight is awful with you not locked on to your opponent with them launching themselves towards you and putting you in an unblockable combo, unless you invest into the melee stat tree, which the game gives you no intensive to do for the fact of how unrewarding it feels The sidequest, Beat on the Brat, contains the most captivating gameplay through the whole game. You meet a boxer, mostly likely the first time you leave your apartment, by the name of Coach Fred, will give you various locations of these known fighters around Night City. If you decide to do this you'll have the honor of doing the following 5 times, dodge, block, attack, repeat, which each encounter lasting longer by not engrossing the player in gameplay and different scenarios, oh no we can't have that, instead the way they boost the difficulty of these fights is by giving them not only more health, but by the difficult spike each one brings to the table. Now in its defense it does try to give you more stakes, like fighting two people at the same time for more money, or bidding up higher to get a rare sniper. But, that's about it, credits, nothing interesting happens after that. And the final boss of them all gives you 64000 eddies, but most likely by that time the melee combat pulls you out of your emerge, if the game already hasn't. 

Now I am fully aware, that hundreds of developers poured their heart out, and time, to make this game for everyone to enjoy, which was shattered by poor management and the arrogance of higher ups at CDProject's going completely out of pocket, promising us, as their customers a product that would be truly, a next gen experience to gawk at, just to be handed, in my opinion, a futuristic copy of a Ubisoft openworld IP if Far Cry and Watch Dogs had let the condom slip off a bit and 7 years later to have a miscarriage just for it to crawl out of the garbage bin it was thrown into. I still have hope that this game could be great, but I don’t know if most of the issues presented can be patched out with a simple hot fix."
1609702595,"Preeeem! Get it now choomba, you won't regret the eddies you will spend on this nova game."
1609702553,"Call this game what you want, but even with the bugs, and texture pop ins, this game is still a lot of fun and sucks you in. There is plenty to do, the world feels full despite the lack of AI, and other flaws you can find in it. If you are looking for fun, you're going to find it in some vein. Some scenes I'll be in a little side quest location and stop for a second to take how beautiful and detailed the atmosphere can be. I saw my fair share of bugs in a lot of games that I wasn't excited about and played on. I would honestly recommend this game at full price, if they keep updating and patching, it will only make a good game even better. I'm a veteran of skyrim, Gta, and Fallout, bugs happen, and the one's that did happen didnt hinder my experience."
1609702839,"I just completed the main story of Cyberpunk, and wanted to share my thoughts. 

Too long, didn't read: 5/5 stars, fantastic game. I have not enjoyed a single player game this much since Morrowind.

Let's get into it. 

Firstly, i am playing this on PC, and i have a good rig. So, running this on ultra settings, all settings cranked up to max, means i might not experience bugs that others are experiencing. It seems unlikely but I accept that if you're running on a PC you know can't handle this properly, it will diminish your experience. I am going to review based on what i've seen, which i believe is experiencing the game as its intended - all settings turned up to max. 

The story is fantastic. My immediate reaction of starting out as a mercenary was mixed - but given the state of the world it makes sense because the options for employment are dramatically limited in this world and it is a struggle to survive. I genuinely felt this is well established, and my character's role in the world made sense. When interacting with characters, I found myself going through the dialogue options and electing not to skip any. The overall experience interacting with other characters is immersive, and enjoyable. The dialogue options you select will shape the game in real, meaningful ways. You could play through this game many different times and have a totally different experienced based simply on the dialogue options you choose. The pace of the story is nice. It's a good mixture of wanting to stop and smell the roses, but also feeling compelled to progress forward quickly. I also appreciated the system that linked dialogue option to character stats. A smarter character should say smarter things, right? I never felt a deep groan as i had to click the option that seemed like something i wouldn't want to say in that situation given the character i'm playing. Initially i was worrying how the game would change given my options selected, for example, ""if i choose this will I miss out on some nice equipment or something,"" but ultimately i stopped worrying about the *game aspect*  and started worrying about the *story aspect,* ie, how will Panam think of me if i say this? If i don't say anything? I don't want to get into any more detail, just simply that the story is engaging, well paced, and enjoyable. The voice actors do a good job bringing their characters to life, and Keanu Reeves is always fun to see on screen. He was the right choice, because of how well liked as a person and actor he is - I was so eager to see the end because it's really hard to know if you can trust Johnny or not. I won't say anymore because that's such an important underlying aspect of the story and I don't want to spoil it for you. 

Night City is gorgeous, and deep. I was about 25-30 hours into my playthrough before i discovered fast travel, and I only started using it because I wanted to price shop all of the different ripperdocs and nightrunners to see what to spend my cash on. I never felt bored or annoyed with traveling in the world because it's so real. Thinking back to my first real deep experience playing RPGs in the early 90s, Final Fantasy 3, and then Final Fantasy 7 - the stories were engaging and interesting, if a bit juvenile, but the world itself was always shallow. Cities had very few people, and towns didn't seem like they could actually support life given there might be one shop, and one farmer. Night City is a true city - it's full of people, things to do, sights to see... Hearing gunshots as you jump on the overpass means something because you know it's not just ambient noise, NPCs are actually shooting at each other, and you can jump in and change the outcome of this interaction. In driving up the freeway from Pacifica to Watson i saw a cop get ambushed by a gang, slammed on the brakes and gave him a hand. It didn't really add to the game story, it didn't really give me any rewards, but it is an example of an interaction that happened in a city that genuinely feels alive. I think you could spend a hundred hours fully exploring this city and doing missions, reading data shards, etc. A quick note on things like data shards - you'll find books, journals, conversations, between NPCs, characters, etc - and you should you read them. They are a part of the world, and add a layer of depth that's truly enjoyable. 

The gameplay itself is fun, and pulls together a few tried & true things you have seen before. We've all played first person shooters. We've all played first person melee games. These things aren't reinvented here in Cyberpunk, although there are cool additions, like  upgrades that let you interact with your weapons in interesting ways, (ie, bouncing bullets, homing bullets), or implanted arm blades, for example. In this way, Cyberpunk is pretty much what you'd expect. I think if you play Cyberpunk as just another shooter, you're not really doing the game justice. The stealth game system and the ability to conquer almost every mission without killing ANYONE is pretty neat. Hacking into camers and machines to disable and distract, silently taking down enemies in a non-lethal way, hiding bodies so that they don't get discovered, it's all pretty cool and fun, and because enemies will move around, you need to be swift and aware of how they're patroling. The hacking system is fun - using abilities like Ping to discover all of the enemies or machines linked to a network, or short circuiting drones, it's all pretty fun. Ultimately you will become powerful enough, if you really invest the time, that much of the game will not be challenging. But this is true of all Elder Scrolls style open world games, where there's a ton to do and you can easily log enough hours and enough missions to become absurdly strong. I focused on intelligence and cool (hacking and stealth) and by the end I could hit things with a 3,000 damage short circuit, one shotting anything that isn't a boss. This didn't really bother me all that much because the game is a sandbox in a lot of ways, much like the elder scrolls games i mentioned. In Morrowind once you get the right stats and gear, you're going to thump anyone. It's not even close. And, this is expected, if you spend a ton of time developing your character in an RPG you're going to be a god. I've seen people complain the game is too easy, and these are the same folks taking apart cans to get hundreds of thousands of eddies to get all of the best upgrades possible. You had your cake, and then you ate it, what did you expect? The one thing i felt was an unwelcome addition is the ability to jack cards from random people. The GTA aspect didn't really feel appropriate here to me, because the nature of Night City is kill or be killed, but in a deeper and more subversive way. So, car jacking some broad because her Body is 4 and yours is 5 seemed strange. It also feels out of place because if people can car jack each other in a city where it's literally kill or be killed in many places, it would be impossible to have even basic services like infrastructure, sanitation, plumbing. 

So to me, the story, the gameplay and the city are all great. There are some bugs, but for me they were silly little things i could easily just ignore or get passed. I think too, though, if you can't run this game on high settings you're going to miss out on the true beauty of Night City, and that's part of the point: being immersed in a world that was painfully crafted from top to bottom. 

If you have the PC to run this and you enjoy playing true RPGs, this is probably one of the best you might ever get. Do you remember in Final Fantasy 3, when you had to memorize an opera and go through it, singing the lines? Roleplaying is a lost art in games and I think you'll find it here if you take the time to look, and stop powergaming and just enjoy. 

5 stars"
1609702437,"its good. but short in the main story. not many bugs for me, at least not to the game breaking type, a weapon looting description open till i look at something else, occasionally clipping, nothing too crazy. good game but not worth what was it 8 years or something?"
1609702310,Amazing
1609702290,Way bellow what i was expecting
1609702272,"if you are only interested in great story, its the game for you. If you expect the ground breaking game it was supposed to be, then sorry but thats just not it.

The game is clearly unfinished. Ai is stupid. Gang and Police AI just stay in one place the whole time, until you start fighting with them. If you get wanted level, cops just spawn around you and kill you. You can't really interact with crowd. There is no arcade games, even the amount of bars/restaurants is very limited. You can't change the way your character looks. No hair stylists etc. The point is, freeroam and sandbox part of this game is basically dead right now.

Even quests are unfinished. Someone forgot to add audio  to few lines in couple of missions. Hell, I saw a typo in last mission of the game. You'd think they'd fixed that before releasing the game. There are plenty of bugs that are repeatable and were clearly known to game devs, If you want to purchase this game right now, just remember that you basically buying the Alpha version of this game.

So why do I recommend the game? Cause the story, characters and side missions are freaking amazing. After finishing the main story all I wanted to do is to play this game again and again. Hasn't happened to me since The Witcher 3. If I play a game, even amazing one like RDR2, I just play it once and thats it. CDPR is great when it comes to story writing.
Although... There is that one aspect i don't like. There is this element of rush, to finish main quests quickly, its very similar to Witcher 3 in that regard. I dislike it, it discourages from doing side missions, some of which are amazing stories on their own (like the Peralez ones).

Aside from that music and graphics are incredible too. 
"
1609702158,New Favorite game amazing no real issues on pc either.
1609702118,I enjoyed the story
1609702085,"I think I've more than earned my right to review this game. I've completed every side quest and every event available in night city and purchased every car.

The game looks great, but has lots of graphical glitches just as it was with gameplay. Ray tracing adds a lot of visual fidelity, but was not worth the performance cost.

Gameplay was really buggy, but it doesn't bother me until very late in the game. Vehicle physics is good, different cars feel different to drive. It has great potential for a good racing experience, but it falls short with terrable AI who can't even drive well enough on a regular road, so they have to teleport cars behind players to look like they are catching up.

The problem with gameplay is its numerical design. Players become way too strong way too early, especially with blades and hacking. I can instant kill bosses since around 30% of my play through, yet I didn't even bother to upgrade my gadgets. Gunplay is fun and challenging. So if you want to have fun during combat, don't play hacker or blade.

Stealth gameplay is weird and broken by stupid and unstable enemey AI. They sometimes can't see you even when you crawl in from of them, but sometimes react instantly without seeing you when you enter a room.

Like Witcher 3, Cyberpunk 2077 has really good stories along with impressionable characters. There're hundreds of snippets of stories to read, but most of them don't make much sense at all. I can see developer's effort in building an immersive world with lots of little details just like in Witcher 3, but it's just too much work.

In conclusion, I think CD Project Red was blinded by Witcher 3's success, and chewed more than they can handle. Bugs are just a result of it. 7 years is a long time for development, even for an AAA title from an experienced developer. Yet they still released the game in an unfinished state. That's just the proof of CDPR being a young company.

I originaoly wanted to give Cyberpunk 2077 an positive. But I turned my review to negative because I chosed the ""bad ending"". You can feel the developer is intentionally and repeatedly telling you how bad your final choices are through NPCs' dialogues. Yet I do not agree with their liberal values. But the game still drags me through an almost 2-hour long sequence, just to tell me how bad my ending is. It feels like a punishment for me, the player, for not agreeing on their liberal values.


"
1609701982,"This game is like an expensive pre-used-""call girl"". When you get going it's quite enjoyable, but you will still regret the amount of money you've spent, especially with all the bugs coming out of the nether regions. 

Wait for a sale or big patches (with the game, obviously not the call girl)."
1609701937,This game has so much to offer if you ignore the bug and meta hating....plus if you have an RTX card is beautiful!!
1609701862,"This game is dense and stunning (read: thicc & pretty). All the murky hype or bomb reviews aside, as someone who went in with zero expectations- I think it's worth your time, addictive, and fun."
1609703102,"Cyberpunk is a mixed bag of things that went terribly wrong, things that work incredibly well, and things that leave you just... disappointed and wishing they were different. I'll split the review into 3 distinctive parts: gameplay, technical stuff, and the story.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
[b]General impressions[/b]
My initial impressions of the gameplay were that it's clunky, unintuitive and unforgiving. I got killed by the initial enemies I encountered in just 2 shots while I needed to make 15 headshots in a row to kill them. The skill system had me very confused and unsure where to invest my skill points.

At first nothing I was doing felt right. But then I started doing side missions and gigs, slowly progressing through the levels and grinding my way up to the top.

[b]Crafting[/b]
Eventually, I have discovered crafting. There is no ability to craft in bulk, a bug with the crafting system let me get infinite XP for the crafting skill, and later I discovered another glitch that basically let me have infinite epic/legendary components, which let me craft incredibly overpowered weapons. Speaking of that...

[b]Combat[/b]
After some time in the game and as your level progresses, the weapons you get become so powerful that any enemy you encounter would go down in just a single shot. This made the game too easy. With crafting you can also craft weapon/clothing mods that turn your guns into incredible killing machines, and with clothing mods you can basically have your crit chance reach 100%, so every shot deals ridiculous amount of damage.

[b]Driving[/b]
Driving cars in Cyberpunk 2077 feels like driving fridges on wheels. The controls feel very clunky and unresponsive, and it's very easy to have your car spin out of control. Crashing into other cars feels unsatisfactory as you just plow right through them like a hot knife through butter.

[b]Police[/b]
The police in the game are incredibly unforgiving jerks that will religiously pursue you and spawn right behind you at all times if you do as much as look at them wrong. Seriously, you didn't make a turn and accidentally ran over a civilian with [b]NOBODY ELSE AROUND[/b] and you instantly get one ""wanted level"" star with police spawning out of nowhere behind you. Seriously, with such dedicated police, Night City should've been free of crime ages ago.

[b]Hacking[/b]
Hacking in the game certainly takes quite a while to get used  to. You need to hold two buttons and navigate through menus, which is very confusing at first, but is okay-ish once you get used to it. Most hacks (hack types) are useless as in my own playthrough I ended up using just two or three of them. Most would alert the enemies and cause your stealth attempt to fail, making 90% of the hacks completely useless in stealth, and in combat you just don't have enough time or concentration to navigate through those convoluted menus. The only times I successfully ended up using hacks was when I needed to disable robots or cameras.

[b]Stealth[/b]
Stealth in Cyberpunk is a completely broken mechanic that has clearly been added as an afterthought when they implemented hacking. Sometimes the enemies wouldn't notice you literally standing in front of them, and other times they'll see you through walls and alert anyone instantly, giving you 0 chance to kill them before they raise the alarm. In general, most missions can be done the loud way as well, but in some cases if you want all the bonuses you are forced to stealth through them, and sometimes it gets difficult to do because of the broken mechanics.

[h1]Technical stuff & Bugs[/h1]
[b]Performance issues[/b]
The game has clearly not been optimized well. The ""recommended"" hardware specs will get you less than 60FPS. It's still perfectly playable, however in some areas it would drop down to 30FPS, making aiming and shooting difficult. There are some areas the level of detail that we could see should have ran far better than they did.

[b]Technical issues[/b]
Sometimes the game would crash out of nowhere. Tt seems like the game REALLY doesn't like when I alt-tab between different windows. The performance seemed to drop to unplayable levels if done enough (3-4) times.

[b]Bugs[/b]
There are a lot of bugs. However, most bugs I encountered did not affect the gameplay in any negative way. They were simple visual glitches, minor derps causing NPCs to enter T-pose instead of their intended animation, causing cars to behave weirdly, physics to become weird, or items being where they're not supposed to be. Dying by falling from 1ft of elevation is just the tip of the iceberg.

[h1]The Story[/h1]
[b]The world[/b]
I gotta admit that the world of Cyberpunk 2077 is truly amazing. You can go exploring for hours and never get bored of it. If you have sufficient imagination you may even start making up your own story of the city, how it could have come to the point it is at today, and how you could've fit into it. It tells the story of corporate exploitation, how the world operates in a lawless environment where government is controlled by mega-corporations. A dystopian lawless world where you could be killed any day and nobody would so much as bat an eye.

[b]Side missions and gigs[/b]
The story is filled with interesting side quests, however the vast majority of so called ""gigs"" and side missions are really just copy-pastas of eachother: go there, kill everyone, collect data shard, rinse and repeat about 50-70 times. Some side missions did give insight into life in Night City and about the world, and were quite interesting to play, but most of it was just grind. I feel like they could be made far more interesting with a few twists here and there.

[b]Main story[/b]
A lot of it depends on what gender your V is, and what side missions you complete as they tie into the main story. The game expects you to have completed side missions before attempting main quest. That means all that grind mentioned previously is a necessity.

The main story is quite short and I feel like it focuses on Keanu Reeves' character, Johnny Silverhand, a bit too much. It felt like the entire story was turned from an open-world RPG into just a linear shooter. No matter in what order you accomplish the tasks, you will always arrive at the same point. No matter what you choose, your choice barely matters apart from one secret ending. All of the story and backstory moments regarding Silverhand barely matter in the end, as you can have everything go in either direction anyway.

Johnny Silverhand feels very forced in the story. Everything revolves around him. You have no choice. You can't choose who you'll become in the city, it's all Johnny Johnny Johnny. All endings as a result involve him one way or another. There's not a single ending that doesn't involve him, making V (the actual protagonist) feel like unnecessary baggage. They could have forced us to just play as Johnny to begin with, and the game wouldn't have changed one bit.

The RPG elements like dialogue choices or open-world feel like unnecessary mechanics leftover from a different, and in my opinion much better, Cyberpunk 2077. I am disappointed in the main story. Cyberpunk 2077's story had incredible potential, with well-written characters and amazing world, however all that potential simply got flushed down the toilet when CDPR decided to give in to Keanu Reeves hype and just alter the focus of the game and put all spotlight onto him. A huge mistake. But I suppose we're all breathtaking.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Despite all this, I do recommend this game. It managed to addict me for days, having me play it and nothing else. It made me feel emotional when it wanted to, and some elements of the game made me squee in joy.

I recommend waiting for a few months (from the moment of the writing of this review) until CDPR can fix the bugs and issues with the game, so that you have a better experience with it. It won't change the story, however the game is worth it for the world exploration alone.
"
1609701673,Still unfinished.
1609701652,"Tuning out the public meming on this game and actually playing it, I genuinely cannot get enough of it. I play my share of multiplayer and single player games, and this game is hitting all the chords for me since I stopped playing Fallout 4 which was the last major single player game I was really invested in. The amount of time they put into side content is ridiculous. I found myself questioning how whether or not I was on a main story mission when actually I was just on a sided gig that you see teased around the city so everything is so webbed not only into your game play but also your surroundings (specifically there is a side quest for The Passion, which you see billboards for). The nods to games I love like portal, the fact that this has so many influences from GTA, to Hitman, to Fallout, to I think even maybe Dystopia source mod, and then you cap it all off with it being themed in the Cyberpunk genre, its just so much fun. 

People complaining about bugs are the worst of my generation the the one after me. I honestly don't get it. Its like any other game. The community complained and complained and so they released it early, you get what you get, and they started patching it. As far as people having trouble running it, its like any other game, if you can't run it, get a better rig or lower the settings. For the console gamers who are playing the last gen version on the new gen systems, you can also go cry in a corner if you need to let it out. This is what happens when people send death threats to game producers to push them to get a game out before its ready. I'd have been fine waiting, but alas, PC master race baby."
1609701448,niceness
1609701416,Great game i have loved every bit of it!!! bug's can be fixed but i have had some hilarious one's xD + no game breaking bug's also. I would highly recommend such a beautiful game!!!
1609701396,"Pest first person I have played for a while. Very vast content.
Would recommend to anyone."
1609701347,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
1609701326,"I've been playing since patch 1.06 on a Ryzen 5 3600x, an RTX 3070, and 16 gigs of 3600 MHz Cl19 RAM. With those specs I've gotten an average of 50 fps on Ultra settings in 1440p. The graphics are so good it looks like it's a movie sometimes and the experience I've had is phenomenal. TL;DR at the end.

With that in mind, here's what I think. This game is the most fluid, best playing game I've ever played. The gameplay between different missions, exploring, combat to stealth to anything else is absolutely seamless. There's next to no loading time even loading into a save from the menu, and no loading screens in normal gameplay. It makes other games look old, slow, and boring by comparison.

The world is diverse, large, and more detailed than any other game I've ever seen. It's amazing seeing just how much time was put into this game, because it definitely shows. I would 100% recommend this game to anyone who loves playing Skyrim, or games like it. I may be 50 hours in, but I've only played a single ending and it feels like I've experienced less than half of Night City's offerings.

In my experience, there aren't that many bugs at all. The bugs that do exist are usually small ones (I saw someone come down a ladder in the T-pose, for example, or occasionally an object being handled by a character wasn't where it was supposed to be, etc. Small things like that). I suspect that the game will get better over time, too.

TL;DR: This game is the best game I've ever played. Fluid, lots of depth and detail, and the bugs are far and few between in my experience. I highly recommend this game."
1609701307,Is very nice
1609701179,"I pre-ordered this game before release and have played exactly 101 hours by this point. All I can say is that while yes the game has bugs, and while the game feels rushed once you take a step back and look at what they promised vs what we got. HOWEVER, I have fallen in love with this game and it has even gotten me into the older games of Cyberpunk, the pen and paper ones. 
       The game is a labor of love, and if you pay attention to the details that are present in the game it is clear the workers that worked on the game really tried their best. The most important thing about this game in my opinion is story, and while I have played so far as a Nomad, Corpo, and am starting Street kid after I beat it a second time, after the prologue you won't see to much of a change, but it does have nods at the backstory you chose. Though the story is really easy to get engaged with, and you do fall in love with the romance options and the characters you meet, I never met a character I found annoying or fake, they all feel rather real to me and I can find myself even enjoying Johnny Silver hand as a character as well.
       
    The game could be improved in my opinion through updates, the game is in no way perfect, but if you do like what Cyberpunk has to offer I do suggest you buy it and play it yourself. There is a lot of memes of the bugs and there is a lot of backlash in media about this game and it's release, but when you shut out the noise and play it, you'll find it is not so terrible, and if you disagree that is fine, I am not a god of opinion I cannot tell you that you'll like something and be one billion percent correct, all I suggest is you give it a chance if you are willing and are able. I hope my little review on the game is good for you all and if you get the game and enjoy it then I am glad, and I hope you continue to enjoy it."
1609701154,"Yes the game is NOT complete.
Yes the game has looooots of bugs.
Yes the game needs polishing.
But also, yes the game is fun (on PC atleast) and the story is definitely worth a shot."
1609701131,"Turned ""shut up and take my money"" into ""give it back and don't receive a penny from me again"".
It's just nothing i've expected, sad.."
1609701115,"There is a simple question to ask yourself before buying this game:

Do you have a high resilience to bugs? ( Including having to reload A LOT to fix them )
If you do, then go ahead and buy this game right away. The amazing atmosphere and story is worth it even at this point.
There is a 10/10 core game here, that is just suffering from bugs and lack of polish in certain aspects.

If not, wait AT LEAST half a year until they fixed this mess and implemented some better systems. The Definitive Edition of this game will hopefully be absolutely incredible.

Anyway, see you in Night City chums."
1609701079,"The game is not without its bugs and glitches. Most of them are funny. A few can be infuriating when they happen. But for me, it's not enough to ruin the gameplay. I enjoy the gameplay enough that I'm willing to have a few bugs here and there. Overall, I really enjoy it and will probably play through it multiple times."
1609701054,"Story good, bugs bad"
1609701036,"Here we go. 

After 5 years of waiting for the next CDPR game, we're finally here. Let me preface this with saying that my expectations were high... Boy, was I disappointed. 

Pros: 
- Beautiful graphics/animations
- Some very well written characters/quests (not enough, see below)
- An original world, characters and items
- Keanu Reeves 

Cons: 
- Weapons and skills are not balanced
- Horrendous driving mechanics 
- A lot of filler quests (races, gigs, find cars). Spoiler: they're not interesting or fun 
- A detailed skill/perk system that doesn’t seem to matter
These two cons might get fixed with future patches. Pinch of salt, please: 
- Ridden with bugs
- Bad optimization

Conclusion: 
A great RPG set in a cyberpunk setting with FPS mechanics. However, for the fans of the genre that might not be enough. For us that went in with high expectations from previous CDPR games, this was a big disappointment.

Score: 
8/10"
1609700839,"This game is not even 50% complete, but I had fun with the story and missions. The soundtrack is also very good. I would say that you should wait to get this game however because it is so buggy and unstable."
1609700838,"Glitchy, yes. Still a great game? Yes. The story and meaty side missions make up for the short story and glitches. I recommend checking this game out even if you wait for some of the glitches to be fixed."
1609700815,.
1609700764,Nope
1609700749,buggy waste of money
1609700537,its a game
1609700866,Wellcum to night city
1609700394,"The game got a very poor reputation. Mostly thanks to people who believed, that a game that is a selling argument for Nvidias 3070, 80 and 90 somehow would work on toasters, too. Of course there is a severe issue with how this was implied to begin with, which is in itself absolutely terrible. For moral reasons it is entirely correct to downvote this game, to get this straight. But i did buy it ahead of time and thus... i judge the play itself here.

The game is. A mixed back. It is disappointing even to me, because my stance always was ""If it is as good as Witcher 3 i am happy."" It is not. The world does not feel as a live, the gameplay is not as interesting and falls down the deep end regardless with how many options you have or that they all feel useful. Breaking the balance is just incredibly easy and im at the point where i just cast fist at everything that walks without doing much else than enjoying the sidequests.

So why do i recommend it then and to who? Well... The Story of the game is still very much Witcher 3 in quality. The characters feel good. The quality of the voice acting is fantastic. The quests themselves might force you to do the same a lot but it does feel different often enough when you are not doing Fixers Cyberpsycho Boogaloo 300 over and over... which is a thing. But even in those repetitive quests there is some character to find. A lot of nutjobs to not-kill but you also got to read up why they went nuts... or can if you want to. Most questlines have interesting interactions, the way you treat NPCs in conversations have lasting effects that may not be obvious but are there...

A lot of work went into this. And if you just want to play a very interesting story around you, Silverhand and the people you meet on the way of solving your problem you will definitely find it here."
1609700359,"I really enjoyed this game. Some interesting themes and general darkness to it. Reminds me of Deus Ex with less conspiracy. Action and gameplay are great. Rendering is fantastic, running on a GTX 1070 (not RTX). The bugs I experienced weren't much different from most games."
1609729710,"I'm really enjoying this game but unfortunately it didn't lived up to the hype.
Don't get me wrong, i'm actually liking the game but do not expect some witcher 3 game YET as it is clearerly not finished, once this game if patched and finished, it has that much potential.

That being said, it is a good game and i'm having a great experience but i expected a bit more from CDPR."
1609700117,"Truly good game on PC. The game play is good without being a game changer, driving is okay. The game shines in it's voice acting and in the beautifuly designed of Night City.  However, there are glitches and annoyances (like the cyberware bloodpump doesn't work). It would also be cool if there was more reaspawning enemies."
1609700075,Epic Gameplay with lots of possibilities. Needed Hardware Power is silly.
1609700067,game is so buggy i cant even play it and they wont give me a refund !!!!
1609699948,Good game but has some serious flaws. A lot of textures for cars and people don't load until you stand around them for a full minute which I have never seen on any other game. Also most of the NPC feel like they are just background noise and not actual people. They may not have delivered on all their promises but CDPR delivered an interesting fun filled world to explore.
1609699917,
1609699911,"It's a bad open world sandbox. Cars/NPCs aren't really the best, and customization is slim. You can't change your character's physical features after initial setup, and you can't get new tattoos. There are tons of other problems like this. Performance wise, I run everything on high at 1080p and average around 40 fps (i5-8600K @ 4.7 GHz, GTX 1070). I get the occasional crash here and there, but generally autosave is good about this + I save manually frequently enough.

The story is awesome, the characters are mostly awesome (some romances are disappointing, but I'm not complaining). Get this game if you think your PC can run it, and I think you'll have a lot of fun."
1609699766,For all the complaining done by fans who are too nearsighted to see the game was forced early because of them; the game holds up well and plays great.
1609699710,"Phenomenal game. A step in the right direction for all RPGs. Night City feels alive and lived in like no other game world. Jackie, Johnny, Vik, Panam, Goro, Mitch, Saul, Judy (to name just a few) all gave off verity that RPGs let alone video games seldom achieve with their characters.

I honestly experienced minimal glitches in bugs in this game the vast majority of which were relegated to audio bugs. While annoying, they either fixed themselves or needed a load of a quicksave 30s back."
1609699671,If you can run it and love buggy messes; its amazing
1609699626,A bugged Masterpiece.
1609699602,"It's true, there are glitches. However, my game was always immersive and fun to play. I was disappointed in the final fight but I was very happy with the ending I got. The game is very dark and a wonderful depiction of how dystopian societies crush the human spirit. Most of all, the characters are wonderful and this is the best acted game I have ever played. If you have the hardware to run it properly, this is absolutely worth the buy."
1609699574,"I short: I like this game and it holds me thanks to perfect atmosphere, but its technical state is horrible, and I doubt patches will solve all of the issues.
In details:
Perfect: atmosphere of fu...ed up future, I mean, I really felt it, like, damn... what if things depicted in this game will actually happen... Its scary and that feeling stays with you for entire game.
Good: main story, graphics
Normal: gameplay
Bad: oh boy... where do I even start... Some things in this game have to be reworked. In fact, whole game should be reworked, starting from game engine, finishing with game UI. Everything looks and feels like a mess - AI, UI, gameplay, audio, graphics. Feels like people in CD Project don't know what kind of game they were developing. First person shooter - why do I have to do several shots in head while using shotgun in order to kill an enemy? RPG - why there are so many useless skills? Stealth - it is castrated as hell. Difficulty levels are imbalanced as hell. This is not alpha or beta version. It fells like some interim version. Bugs... seriously, I'm not kidding, THIS IS THE MOST BUGGED GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE. Animations, graphics, AI, scripts - all these things have bugs and you are facing with them almost every minute.
So, if you REALLY believe that CD Project will be able to do any patches while fighting in courts with investors, and, that these patches will solve ENDLESS amount of issues this game has, wait(probably forever), and then buy this game.
If you are realist, have nothing else to play and most importantly have decent PC - buy this game now.
It is hard for me to recommend or do not recommend this game. I'm enjoying and hating it at the same time."
1609699549,Do it!
1609699523,Runs well on 3080 GPU with i7 Quad Core
1609699265,"Version 1.06
I would recommend not getting it atm, and wait for the patches. This has to be one of the buggiest games I have ever played. The Police just spawn behind you, and instantly kill you."
1609699227,"This Game was very fun for me, Although this game gets a lot of hate i really enjoyed this, The Story is awesome and there's so many ways to end it, Yes there are a lot of bugs and glitches iv'e only encountered one game breaking glitch but was easily fixed. I believe if the developers mint up the game enough this can be greater than it already is, even though its a little broke it looks amazing and is really fun. I hope they introduce an Online Mode to add more play, but other than that this game is very good and just needs to be touched up a little especially on consoles. 8/10"
1609699179,"My experience with Cyberpunk 2077 consists of over 200+ hours of game play.  I've been waiting for this game to launch since the first announcement years and years ago and got it as soon as it was available to pre-purchase it.  There will be no spoilers in this review as i recommend for anyone looking for a fun first person shooter with an awesome storyline to buy it.just make sure that your PC can handle it's requirements.

10/10 rating goes to the storytelling throughout the entire game.  The choices that you make have an impact on how you proceed throughout the game and the epic conclusions that vary.  I have played all of the available paths and explored many different variants of choices to be made.  Also note that there is an effect to wearing certain iconic clothes.  The amount of detail put into the storylines are epic and you won't truely appreciate it fast tracking through the game.  I recommend this game for this feature alone.

10/10 rating goes to the graphics that truely shine in Night City and the Badlands.  They promised something epic and delivered on this feature.  Cyberpunk is suppose to be a dark and gritty future filled with danger and hardship which this feature delivers.  The difference between day and night is immense.  No loading between districts means fluid motion throughout the world which shines racing over the roads or across the badlands.  I recommend that you stop now and then and take a look around - you might find some nice things happening that you otherwise wouldn't notice.  I recommend this game based off of the graphics alone.  All the negative reviews and trash talk about Cyberpunk 2077 not working as promised in my opinion is a lie.  The minimum system requirements for this game has always been announced for the PC and console versions - if your PC or console can't handle the graphics it is your fault for buying any game that your PC or console can't handle.  I have friends that play Cyberpunk 2077 on their Xbox one consoles and the game shines.  I recommend this game for the graphics alone.

There are a lot of bugs in the game which is to be expected with the release of any new game and i am impressed with the quick patches that have been released since its launch to fix many of them.  Thumbs up for this.

The driving in the game with the cars might seem a mess until you realize it was on purpose.  I love this feature of the game.  The devs put some cool realism to the driving and the detail of the vehicles it amazing.  I will give you a few hints to counter all the negative reviews about the driving.  Yes it is easier to drive between vehicles on motorcycles because you are not driving a clunker huge car.  Yes it is difficult to drive a clunker huge car.  If you are driving a fast car going 100 miles per hour and you need to make a sharp turn - yes you will wreck.  Hint - the camera views while driving (first person is to see the detail inside the vehicle and possibly look at an NPC you have in it or to just chill - third person view is for driving).

The sexual content of Cyberpunk 2077 is a nice feature with the romances that are available.  However it is not a focus point of the game despite all the reviews talking about it.  It is another gritty element of the dark theme of the game.

There are a lot of things about the game that do seem incomplete such as the a lot of buildings that seem to be here and there meant for something yet there is nothing to do.  It is obvious that the devs were still adding a ton of elements to the game such as more NPC interactions.  However this does not take away the experience of the storylines.

Overall if you are looking for a first person shooter that has some really emotional and epic storylines that take place in a dark and gritty future world of Cyberpunk themed charisma that has a decent crafting feature and not overly complicated skill system then Cyberpunk 2077 is the game for you.

"
1609699100,"Both main story and most side quests are very good and engaging (excellent characters!), but the open-world aspect of the game (just having fun in the city) feels... unfinished. Game feels pointless beside scripted events and quests. Other than that, prologue part felt too short and looks like it was just cut from the final release... + of course, AI is nonexistent and itemization is executed poorly. Maybe CDPR will fix it eventually, I don't know - I guess I'll check it after some time.

Still, I had some fun with it - hence the endorsement, but it's not my dream game (more like, let's say, 7/10)."
1609699029,"Despite the minor bugs that pop up here and there (nothing even remotely game breaking) the game is really fun. The story is compelling and the gameplay itself is fun. There is a crazy amount of content that keeps you trapped in Night City. The devs seem to really care about the game, even with the seemingly rushed and buggy release (which isn't really the devs fault btw, but that's another topic for another time). Fixes for bugs are rolling in weekly, and I personally feel like this game is going places. It just needs time. I would definitely recommend."
1609699008,Played since the start and its been a bumpy road but its got alot better since then
1609698975,"Great game as long as your part of the PC Gaming Master R.

Think of it as the Witcher 3 in 2077 and you aren't too far off."
1609698872,"I haven't been this immersed into a game since mass effect trilogy and witcher 3. The story and the setting of Night City is brilliant. I wish the main story was longer and Night City had more things going such as underground trains, more npcs with unique dialogues and more futuristic things in general"
1609698842,"Is this game perfect? NO
Does it have bugs? YES
Does this game deliver all that it promised? IN SOME WAYS, NO.

However this is the truth to consider.

Is this game fun? PPFFF, YAH! 
Is this game a great technical and gameplay achievement? ABSOLUTELY!
Is this game worth my money? YOU'D BE A FOOL NOT TO SECURE A COPY OF THIS GAME.

The part that a lot of people miss when judging this game is the massive opportunity that a game like this opens for the future of RPGs. Cyberpunk 2077 is a landmark and I am very curious to see how it will influence the development of future products. This game set a new standard and it's plenty clear to see. Does it do it perfectly? No, of course not. Does it have imperfections? Obviously!. But should be judge it harshly because of that, while dismissing entirely the vast amount of qualities and positives that this game has? Obviously not.

Buy the game. Play it. Understand what you have in front of you, and enjoy it for what it is, and not for what YOU thought it SHOULD be. Approach this game from the only sensical perspective: This game OWES YOU NOTHING."
1609698821,"Good game. In it's current state though, I cannot recommend buying it. Filled with bugs to the point its pretty insulting that they released it like this."
1609698798,"Amazing cyberpunk city.  Fantastic attention to environment details like the graffiti in a bathroom, the neon lights reflecting off the wet streets.  Soaring pristine corporate penthouses and dingy run-down basements.

Graphics with ray-tracing are pretty amazing.

The combat itself is just okay, but with a little imagination it's pretty fun.  The hacking and options are good, but honestly not as good as similar games like Deus Ex.

The dialog and characters are great, and has some really special moments.

Overall I'd like to see it filled in with a little more content.  Small touches like ability to play an arcade game, or like there's a number of roulette tables and slot machines.  Seems like should be able to play them.

The hacking mini-game is no replacement for Gwent, I felt like Gwent made the game-world of W3 so much more lived in because when you went into an Inn it wasn't just regular RPG stuff like rent a room or buy supplies, it was like you were really interacting with the innkeep.  

I give this 7.8 out of 10 and really worth playing, but it has much more potential...   Hope they add some stuff to the existing game systems, not just a few more scripted missions.

"
1609699326,"Sooo what can I say? I am most likely not playing the game like 90% of everyone else. I have been playing the game with a driving wheel, mouse and keyboard on the side for when I am not driving and I have VR enabled... Man does this game look amazing in VR!"
1609698759,its a great game to play. almost at same level with Assassins Creed Valhalla
1609698742,It's a good game but bugs need to be fixed. Gamebreaking bugs annoy the piss out of me.
1609698604,"Where to start with this title? I played the hell out of it and I loved every second of it, but can I recommend it? No. At least not in its current state. I won't lie, Night City is a hell of a drug and kept me glued to my seat throughout my extended playtime, but it was also rife with bugs --mostly visual-- and the main story was lackluster to say the least. 

As of writing this, I've completed two endings, one of which is supposedly the 'good' one, but I didn't get much satisfaction out of it. In fact, I wasn't even aware I was at the last mission until I was prompted with a point of no return. It came that abruptly and very early on. Luckily, I had decided to stop before that mission and explore the world. That is where the fun came in. There is always something to do.

However, as much as it drew me in my critically minded self couldn't help but notice all the things missing from the game. You can't change your character after they are made. The weapons are kind of all the same in their type, only a handful of differences that I noticed. How little your cybernetics physically change you. The bugs mentioned above, which --for me-- seemed to get worse the longer I played. And (the most important bit) there seem to only be two active prostitutes in all of Night City. What!?  

Maybe it was cut for time and will be added later? I'm not sure, but I can't recommend it in its current state to  the average gamer and I'm afraid they will never be able to fix the story. That's the worst part and it is what it is. Short and not very impactful for a story made inside such a high minded setting."
1609698602,"It's got bugs, it's a little hard to run, DLSS takes a little while to be effective, whatever man. It's a great goddamn game."
1609698483,glitchy but good!
1609698379,"The game is one of the best RPGs of 2020 - if you have the machine to run it, as I do. If you have a great PC, you will have an amazing exp just being able to do whatever you want when you want to, but of course things are being ironed out. Its a massive game so if no bugs were present I would be simple amazed. All of the systems at work here come together in meaningful and awesome ways, and to get it perfect is just not possible without spending a year on play testing alone. With the core game and DLC coming in 2021 then this game is going to continue to get better and more fun. If you hate open world games as I tend to, this one sucks you in and makes you feel like V. You really are a part of this ever changing and evolving city. I also think people got their expectations too high and were let down - I never let myself get reviewers tell me if I like something. So for me, this game is awesome and I recommend it."
1609698337,"storyline and design of the city is astonishing, characters are well written, i had fun playing it... although the main story could be 20/30 hours longer :\
p.s. driving sucks"
1609698238,Amazing game would highly recommend to anyone that has a decent PC. Playing with Raytracing on Ultra settings is aboslutely phenomenal and will make you feel immersed as never before. This game is truly a masterpiece !!!
1609698248,"After finishing the campaign in [b] my first play-through (Nomad life-path) at 105 hours, I simply cannot recommend this game enough. [/b] I'm usually not the person to write big reviews, but this game deserves it.
Sure it has its flaws and occasional bugs, but personally I've encountered nothing game-breaking... [i] apart from that one time where I parked my car at the edge of the map and got out, only to step outside of the map, being unable to get back... [/i]

However, if you can look past that, this game is simply a rough diamond that could do with some chiseling and polishing.

Note: I've played this game on a 1080Ti OC, i7-7700k OC, 16GB DDR4 3200MHz RAM and Samsung 960Evo M2 SSD. Graphics on Ultra 1440p, with shadows on low, and managed to run at a stable 50-60 fps.

[h1] Setting and story [/h1]
The Cyberpunk setting and vibe it creates is simply amazing. It really feels as if you're living in an alternate reality in 2077. Nothing screams Cyberpunk as this game's setting does. 
[b] Graphically stunning [/b] , e.g. the reflections of water on the streets seem so real. Effects are amazing, [b] sound job is superb [/b] , explosions have different feelings and sounds depending on their size and what it is that explodes. (For instance a car exploding vs a grenade) Guns sound and feel great etc.
Street walls have custom textures all over in forms of graffiti and unique pieces of graffiti are to be found all over the city, featured on ""Tarot Cards"". [i] I do really wish there was a kind of card game to be played with those. [/i]
[b] The story is one of the best stories I've ever experienced [/b] in all games I've played [i] (note, I'm biased because I'm a sucker for the Cyberpunk genre... Altered Carbon, looking at you). [/i] Story's really well written and gets you hooked because of the way it's written and its great characters.
[b] The music [/b] and songs that are all custom-made for this game make it even more immersive. In retrospect, the songs all go about your story in Night City and also what you're about to do. The name of missions often refer to songs, and not only in-game songs either. e.g. Killing In The Name, Chippin' In.
[b] The cars are awesome, but driving could be improved. [/b] More on that later.

[b] Climate: [/b] The weather is mostly sunny (Night City's based in California, so that should be normal...), with sometimes rain and in the Badlands I've even encountered sandstorms. To people saying those are all scripted because of quests, that's not true. I've encountered a certain point where I was driving around and thinking the sandstorm was related to the quest because I felt like I was driving in circles, seeing the same area over and over again... Turns out it wasn't scripted and I really was driving next to the same thing over and over again (same assets because I was driving next to a solar energy plant).

[h1] Choices DO matter [/h1]
For the love of God, I can't stress this enough. As opposed to some people's claims: [b] Choices DO matter. [/b]
[b] Life-paths maybe not so much, apart from certain different options sometimes, [/b] but the choices you're making in the game have an influence on the game's ending(s) and romance options etc.
People who keep comparing this game to games like Skyrim & Fallout 4 and claim those were more RPG than this one, are just remembering it wrongly. Fallout 4 basically funnels you into the same thing over and over again, apart from one element, your choices matter way less than this game, which is exactly the same case with Skyrim. Being able to choose factions and joining certain guilds is an element I missed in this game, which Fallout 4 and Skyrim do offer you.
Although... [spoiler] I basically became an Aldecaldo after romancing Panam as Nomad, but that doesn't really offer / mean much. [/spoiler]

[h1] Bugs, bad points and areas of improvement [/h1]
[b] The game has occasional bugs, but for me nothing REALLY game-breaking. [/b] My play-through however was mostly bug-free apart from the major one mentioned earlier. But which game doesn't have bugs? Especially in its first three weeks after release, and having already played 105h in those three weeks, as opposed to sometimes encountering bigger bugs in other games many months later as I'm not always buying games on release day anymore. Personally I haven't experienced even close to half as many bugs as I've encountered in early Skyrim days.
This game simply had two major disadvantages: the first being that Witcher 3 raised the bar so high, even though most people seem to have forgotten or don't know how buggy it was on release day. And the second being that with the amount of hype this game got, it simply could not deliver what people were making it out to be in their minds. Unrealistic expectations often turn into disappointments, which this game in no way was. Thoroughly enjoyed every single minute of it (so far).
Being used to playing games like Skyrim, Fallout, Witcher, [i] hell even growing up with games on old handheld consoles such as Pokémon Red on Gameboy Color etc., [/i] I've picked up the habit of saving every so many minutes, like every five minutes or so. Or every time you pick up some nice loot, or achieve something like clearing a fight or so. Doing this I always had a fail-safe in case things would really go wrong, or I would really encounter a major bug, as then I could simply re-load my manual save again. Fortunately, I've only had to use it once for a bug, and once for a choice I've made which I didn't like.... Yes, looking at you, Angel & Skye choice. FYI, if you don't want to make the mistake I did: [spoiler] Skye is the girl. [/spoiler]
[b] Areas of improvement: [/b] After beating the game and doing literally every side job and gig, it would be nice if there were some events replayable, or for instance have races etc. that you could participate in, or gang wars etc. And of course join a certain gang as said before.
Driving could do with some tuning and improvement. For instance give you more of a speed feeling when you're going at high speed. Would also love to be able to custom paint the cars and perhaps even add own visuals to them. You can for instance buy some amazing cars, but you can only buy them in that specific colour, yet have NPC's riding around in the same car, but with nicer colours... Pity we can't do that. Hopefully they'll add this in a free DLC.
Personally I can't wait for when they add [b] New Game +, [/b] hopefully that will introduces some kind of transmog that allows you to wear the best armour you have, but have it look like your favourite armour, remove level cap and have enemies and quests etc. level with you.

[h1] Hardware [/h1]
The game's very taxing on your hardware, but I guess that's no wonder with those graphics. [b] Major kudos to the fact that there are basically no loading screens at all, [/b] apart from when you launch the game or when you flatline (die). As stated earlier: [b] I recommend to save as often as possible, [/b] because, well... you know... shit happens.
As stated before, I played on 1440p Ultra settings with shadows on Low on my years-old rig with a 1080Ti OC, i7-7700k, 16GB 3200MHz RAM, installed on a 960 EVO M.2 SSD.

[h1] Summary/ TL;DR [/h1]
The game is fully worth its price and I cannot recommend it enough.
Might not be the best game I've ever played, but it's currently most certainly my favourite one."
1609698108,"This game isn't as buggy as Skyrim was, and we all cut that game a break. I don't understand all the hate? The game is visually stunning. However, the story is a bit short but the side quests make up for it. I'm looking forward to the content the DLC will bring. 9/10"
1609697914,Best of 2020
1609698257,"""It's where expectations and reality collide to create a heap of disappointment"" - CyberPunk 2077 Deep Dive Video (2019).

Story: 8/10 - Noticeably lacking depth in areas, too short for a game of this calibre. 
Graphics: 10/10 - Truly revolutionary.
Physics: 8/10 - Driving is on point, especially motorcycles, noticeable bugs in some areas.
Combat: 7/10 - Engage the enemy on your own terms, many options, things can get intense.
Free-roam/RPG element: 3/10 - Outside of the story the game is deficient in any depth. GTA IV beats it on this one.

Cyberpunk 2077 does a great job of creating the illusion of a bustling futuristic metroplis on the surface - But a closer look makes you realise how much it's missing...

The graphics are phenomenal, the story is touching and immersive, but lacks depth  - You don't want it to end, but the story-line creates a sense of urgency, making the player rush unknowingly through the main story plot and before you know it the end credits are rolling. A mere 20 hours of main plot game-play isn't sufficient and left me thinking ""Is that it?"" ""But now what?"" at multiple stages, it always felt like there should be more to the story and that something was missing. The story is amazing but it could have been so much more with a little extra substance added to it.

Bugs are there and will be fixed, what concerns and disappoints the most is the fact that lots of features were stripped/erased from the planned game and leave noticeable voids in the 'end' product, creating the sense that the game and story lacks depth in places. 

Outside of the story and side jobs the game is void of life. Cyberpunk 2077 does a great job of creating the illusion of a bustling futuristic metroplis on the surface with its revolutionary graphics and scale when you're racing from one mission trigger to the other, but when you look closely - When you step away from the missions and explore, you notice how much is actually missing. You make your way through the detailed and diverse crowd in a busy market place to step into a bar for a few drinks, you sit at the bar and order a drink - A box pops up and you select from a number of generic items that are found around the map anyway and you magically consume it once it's selected... No animation and no interaction with the bartender. You leave the bar and head deeper into the market, you engage one of the many in the crowds that pass you by, only to be greeted/acknowledged with the same 2-3 pre-set lines, as if the populace's vocabulary has been shrunk... Pull your gun in the marketplace and everyone just crouches, in exactly the same animation, no fleeing, no fighting, no begging just the same pre-configured response, there's no variation and that's what stops this game from being truly revolutionary in every aspect. Outside of the main story and side quests everything is stale, which leads to ruined immersion. Games from the mid 2000's like GTA IV had more depth to its open-world than this. 

""Thousands of NPCs will have actual daily routines throughout Night City's six districts, including a ton of robust and varied characters with cyborg implants, unique designs and animations, and day and night cycles."" - Don't get sold on their marketing and lies, if you actually watch the AI characters they stay in the same location doing the same thing and repeating the same dialogue and using the same set of scripted responses to any of the players actions.

If you like playing games for their story-lines and running through missions, get this game it's story is gripping and immersive, the story characters feel real. But If you're looking for a true open-world game that feels alive, sadly this isn't it, you'll find a more enriched environment on GTA. It seems Cyberpunk will go down as the game that was so revolutionary but yet never was. There is so much wasted potential here and it's sad. We can only hope things change, similar to the way No Man's Sky turned things around."
1609697780,"I say no because this game needs about another year, or three in the oven before it is done. Aside the fact that the game looks awesome (If you can even run it that high) the function of the game will drastically drown how it looks out. This game functions worse than a Playstation 2 game at best. The bugs, glitches and broken scripted events would make you wish you were playing The Elder Scrolls: IV Oblivion because even that functions far better. Cops in this game are embarrassing to the fact they don't chase you. They just appear and swarm you so the onslaught never ends. The story in this game is so bland in the way that it feels like you are doing everything for absolutely nothing. The beginning of this game is amazing but the second the prologue ends, the entire story takes a dip for the worst. The story is also extremely short in this game which does not really help it at all, most of the story and background is in side missions. There is absolutely no good ending, everything you do in this game feels like an abysmal waste of time. Any choice you take does not actually change the story, it is written very linearly. The gun play is really stiff, late PS2 early PS3 stiff, just makes you tired after a while because the NPCs are so brainless Oblivion NPCs seem like geniuses. A ton of the animations do not synchronize to your character so you'll take a drink with the bottle in your forearm. The loot in this game ends up being reskins around midgame and the gun selection compared to a lot of other games is very very low. If you are considering purchasing this game, just do not. Wait a year maybe two years until CDPR gets it together, save your money. If you want to play a cyberpunk game that functions and has an enriching story head over to Deus Ex. I hope to see that one day I can rescind this review and leave one that is far better."
1609697780,"It is blatantly obvious that the developers were forced by executives to release something they weren't proud of or ready to release. It's obvious too that the interference from the ""higher ups"" was nothing short of destructive in the development of this game which clearly had such potential.

I hope the devs are allowed more free rein in the aftermath of this nonsense to actually fix it."

1609697602,"I was really doubtful about getting this game, with all the controversy and bug reports and what not. But beneath all that, there is a game the Devs created and man is it beautiful. Yeah, It has a lot, I mean a lot of bugs, but no game-crashing ones for me after playing for 55 hours. CDPR nailed it again with the story-telling, and besides the main quest, the side jobs are equally enjoyable with characters that you'll genuinely come to care about. Would give it 8/10, but definitely a 10/10 when the bugs are patched."
1609697433,"It has problems.

But it is a fantastic experience.

Get it, it's one of my favorite games of all time now."
1609697395,"Buy Cyberpunk, customize your Cyberjunk"
1609697349,Yeh nah bruv
1609697298,"Awesome looking game if your system can run it at higher settings. So many bugs a glitches that can both ruin the experience, or just give you a good laugh. I get around 60 FPS on Ultra with my PC, but then it dipps into the 40s in the city... Sparkly textures on reflective surfaces from my GPU not being able to handle the details.
My System Specs: 
Ryzen 5 2600x 
Gigabyte GTX 1660 Super Gaming OC 
1 TB NVME SSD
EVGA 550w 80+ Bronze  
ASUS PRIME B450M-A CSM"
1609697255,"Playing on i6700k/RTX2060 @ 2560x1440 using ""high"" game settings. ~50-70 fps. Contrary to what the 'Net says, I've had few glitches, no CTD, and no game breaking bugs. 

It certainly needed some more polish, but the things I've encountered are no worse than I've seen with other AAA titles in recent years including RDR2, which just won Steam's Game of the year.

Cyberpunk was very over-hyped. We expected something life changing and got a normal RPG. I don't feel ripped off, just disappointed due to the hype."
1609697244,"Even with all the bugs and the missing features, Cyberpunk 2077 is a great game."
1609697243,"The Good: The story, characters, setting, and gameplay are all top-tier. While V is clearly written to be a stand-in for you, and not a great character in and of themselves, the other characters make you forget it almost immediately.

The Bad: The RPG elements are... forgettable. Gear feels inconsequential, and is often a mismatched fever dream you want to forget you're wearing (thank God you're in 3rd person most of the time). Perks, and the associated Stats, feel important at first... but don't really do much, to be honest. Leveling feels too stingy, to be honest--I was only, maybe, 60% through my main trees by the end?

The Ugly: Jesus, the bugs. I'm a veteran player of Bethesda games, so I have a high tolerance for T-Posing, random floating objects, NPC AI glitches, and the like... but having game breaking crashes that force me to feel like I'm walking on egg-shells in-between saves is just awful. Some have reported worse and some have reported that they barely had any. YMMV here, and I won't belabor the point, but I almost didn't finish the game because of this. It was *that* frustrating.

TL;DR: I loved this game, despite the constant, disruptive, crashes that happened every 15 minutes-1.5 hr. Even now, after having cut my 100% completion dreams short until stability comes in Q1 2021 sometime, I find myself wanting to fire it back up and start a new game. It's... just got that much potential. I'd highly recommend the game... but maybe after the patches come to fix up the mess this launched in."
1609697236,"Playing this game gives me the same feelings as Fallout 4 did back in 2015. Same saving fervor required to bypass bugs, same immersion into the world, same stealth combat, same spamming on the crafting bench, same slightly unreliable yet satisfying shooting.
If you enjoyed Fallout 4 then I would expect the same to be true of Cyberpunk 2077. I definitely expect this game to fall under my game purchase criteria of 'will I get at least one hour of entertainment out of each $1 that I spend?'"
1609697185,"There are bugs. I've had a few minor ones, nothing major though. But the story...so far iz so damn good. The characters feel human, they options in pathing and how you spend your points and do the missions is also very very good. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed with a few things: namely the support on the other consoles and the lack of optimisation on certain PCs and parts of the game feeling quick (not 8 years worth for sure) but I love it. Somethings keeping me going and I don't plan to stop yet"
1609697122,"Terrible optimization in this game, please, justify how i get drops to mid 40s with an RTX 3070 & Ryzen 2600x? and before saying its CPU bottleneck im running this trash at 1080p with dlss. How in the hell i have to activate dlss with a new gen GPU at 1080p to get solid 60fps? and even with that i get drops when i go to night city center or crowded areas. CDProjekt you deserve all this hate with your lies, driving feels like im on ice all the time, city looks empty, far from the quality of the witcher 3. Really disappointed and i feel lied."
1609696974,super glitchy but still super fun and the story is awesome with how many routes and side quests and the little stuff here and there that seems to have no meaning but it does is just incredible and awesome
1609696673,"A broken, unfinished mess, and I'm not even talking about the glitches."
1609696671,I like cyberbug 9999 so much
1609696600,"CP77 is just... okay. I didn't really go into this game with any expectations. Here's what I got out of ~140 hours.

I would say the biggest disappointment about this game is the lack of any truly meaningful choices. What you say during a conversation might determine what dialogue you get later down the road, but that's about it. With one or two exceptions early on in the story. 

You are not the protagonist of this story. V is. You aren't making a character and playing it out how you want. You are presented with a predetermined set of choices and get to see what happens to V when you decided for him/her. [spoiler]I felt more like another Engram in V's head than V himself.[/spoiler] The choices I was given were choices I'd never choose if I was V. The developers have a clear vision of who V is, and you're just along for the ride. Being evil is not an option.

The game itself felt like an amalgam of mechanics taken from other games. Those other games did them better, but this one did it well enough. 

The movement felt decent. Not as good as something like Dying Light, but good enough. A bit absurd when you think about it though. In Dying Light you're just a fleshy person who does parkour. Here you're a god damned cyborg that can't fall more than 25 feet without being flatlined. The vehicle handling was probably one of the most frustrating things about this game for me. Bikes felt really really good, car handling was almost exclusively terrible. First person in vehicles was also completely impossible for me with the default POV. I didn't even bother trying again after going third-person. 

The combat was engaging enough. Melee felt pretty good, probably the best part of this game. I can't speak to ranged weapons as much, because I used them for a very small fraction of my playtime. Stealth felt lackluster when comparing it to something like Metal Gear, but it was at least an option. Enemies would sometimes magically identify a body that they had absolutely no way of seeing if it wasn't in a disposal object, which was irritating. 

Despite my gripes, it was still a pretty fun game that provided me with 140 hours of distraction from quarantine. I didn't experience any game breaking bugs like save corruption. I had a few minor visual glitches happen to me, but I suspect that's because I'm using an older GTX card. I got softlocked a few times on poorly coded objects, but I saved frequently enough that it was only a minor inconvenience. Load times are rough, even on SSD. 

My last complaint about this game is probably nitpicking, but I found it completely immersion breaking that in a world where I can replace my genitals with Mr. Stud, get robot legs that let me double jump, and replace my arms with Mantis Blades... I can't get my hair cut or dyed after character creation..? Seriously? There needs to be post character creation customization. This is a massive oversight in my opinion. If I was going to give this game a out of 10 numerical score, this alone would drop it a full point for breaking my immersion.

Anyways, play the game, it's pretty alright."
1609696497,Even with the bugs..its story makes the game absolutely outstanding.
1609696483,"A piece of art with a sweeping story, a huge range of narrative choices and 5 different endings that are all worth seeing. It's been an incredible journey over the past three weeks. The only thing I'm sad about is that it's left me wanting more. I can't wait for a content update, expansion, DLC or whatever the kids are calling it these days.

Despite the bugs (yeah yeah, we know) and the frequent feeling you're playing a game that's still in beta, it's an incredible game and worth every cent and minute I spent on it. 

What I loved:
- The sweeping vistas
- busy city streets with something new happening around every corner
- very good voice acting
- how different the various endings are
- the boxing game
- the street races

What could be improved:
- Dialog options having a bigger impact
- The UX and UI - they are not always intuitive and don't accommodate batch/bulk actions (like crafting)

I'm sure I forgot stuff. Anyway. Play. This. Game. It rocks. (sometimes literally)
"
1609696468,"Game concept, Story and violence are perfect and as expected... Hoping they can fix the bugs."
1609706241,"I'd like to say oh another great game from witcher' developers... And I can! At least if we are talking about the story. It is just great itself and nothing else needed to be said. But not gameplay. Maybe not yet. I wish one day maybe in 2025 I will return to Cyberpunk and it will be fun. I'm not saying there is no fun in the game right now. There is! But while you are playing a game fot 50 bucks you want to have everythink (at least 90%) done and don't have to quicksave the game every single minute because you cannot move or you die because you stepped on a rubish. Also the problem is automatic save. I mean you are playing hard mission while you are trying to complete all being undetected and you did this, great! Then after 30 minutes you die by some random bug and you have to complete this mission once again... It sucks. Like for me for now it is a 6/10 game. It's more than 5/10 so I said I recommend this but if I had this money back I would rather buy an ounce of potatos or something"
1609696336,bugs aside ive had a blast playing this game
1609696284,"Bad reviews are written by Arasaka's NetRunners.
Please do not believe in them.

I personally think that the bugs and glitches made the game even more interesting.
60+ Hours and counting. Will update after next Hotfix. Peace out Chooms."
1609696251,great game open world if you love going off on side missions or just exploring this is the game for you
1609696164,Great Game!
1609696093,"Cyberpunk 2077 has its own minuses, for example bad optimization, no character, car, or weapon customization, but the game play, story line, character development, and music are certainly the best. I enjoyed every minute of playing Cyberpunk 2077. I am replaying it for the 3rd time now. If one has a good PC (not a console!) it is certainly worth his or her time! 
"
1609696068,"Contras
O jogo possui alguns bugs, alguns são engraçados (carros sendo arremessados do nada, por exemplo), outros estragam a diversão (como ficar preso em objetos e ter que dar reload). Recomendo que, quando finalizar um gig, crie um save manual pois nem sempre isso ocorre de forma automática. Dirigir carros é horrível, fazer curvas é ruim, parece que ta sempre dirigindo um caminhão, as motos até que estão de boas. Além disso, faltam otimizações e polimentos.

Prós
O jogo é lindo, recheado de coisas pra fazer, NPCs carismáticos, umas histórias paralelas muito doidas, tem alguns detalhes que eu adorei (não vou entrar em detalhes pra não dar spoiler). Eu me diverti muito, nem vi passar as horas. A grande maioria das missões te oferece opção de stealth e ele funciona bem, tem muita opção de customização do char pra ajudar nisso.

Pra finalizar, acho que 200 reais é MUITO caro, principalmente porque até o momento do review, o jogo não possui multiplayer, mas vale a pena, gostei muito."
1609695924,"The game left me quite emotional by the end of the main storyline. I truly connected with the characters. That in and of itself is enough to make come back to it again and again. Then there's the open world. Seeing the tall skyscrapers, neon lit busy markets, stormy (habooby?) deserts are just a treat to the eye.  Feels on par with a movie production

The story, characters, visuals, dialogue, music are the main driving force of this game.  The developers at CDPR have mastered the story-driven narrative game style and this game showcases it to perfection."
1609695842,"Despite bugs and glitches, the overall game is amazing. Not quite up to GTA standards but holds its own within this category. Must have NEXT GEN console/computer to experience this game at all. Still playing after 100 hours."
1609695837,"Despite its bugs, Cyberpunk 2077 offers a futuristic dystopian sandbox to play in. The characters are interesting and I found many of the side quests engaging. If you have the system hardware to support the game, it is well worth your time if you are a fan of the genre."
1609695807,"After the Witcher 3 I expected a lot more from CDPR. For a game that was marketed as the future of gaming, this certainly isn't it. I have two major complaints: 1- terrible AI and 2- terrible physics. 
Overall, I would still recommend this game, with all of it's flaws. It's not the game that everyone was waiting for but it truly is a lot of fun to play.

Pros:
- Good story line
- Good variety of weapons and melee weapons to choose from
- Many different playing styles to choose from. Can switch and play different playing styles in one play through
- Lots of mods to character (skills, cyberware, etc.)
- Fun to play
- Good side missions

Cons:
- TERRIBLE NPC AI (NPCs you're not fighting like ppl walking on the streets). This is actually quite shocking coming from a game that was marketed as the future of gaming. NPCs are rarely interacting with each other or with vendors. Also, why is there only one mod when they're frightened? No one tries to fight you occasionally when you steal their car? NPCs don't thank you when you protect them from getting robbed? 
- NPCs you're fighting feel like they have basic AI
- Bad/outdated physics in general. Some examples: Light polls break from multiple places and fall unrealistically when hit by car, drinks in cups don't look liquid at all and don't move when cup is moved, grenades tossed in water will explode like there's no water at all, etc...
- Minimap doesn't zoomout when driving, forcing you to turn abruptly when turn comes up
- In game menu, inventory and such, could have been made more user friendly especially when it comes to comparing item stats
- General glitches (which I'm sure this will keep getting fixed as time passes)

CDPR, I'm not sure how feasible it is to fix the physics in the game now but if at all possible, please release a major update with a more refined NPC AI that would match today's capabilities."
1609695697,"After the initial patches, great game to play. Amazing graphics and incredible depths in side story lines."
1609695440,"while this game is very buggy in some ways most of them are not big deals at this point and the ones which were major issues have been solved, the game is very fun and has an excellent story. the first two hours or so  of the game before you finish the first big part of the story are not great and can feel tedious my suggestion is just ignore side quests and the like on that part and then enjoy the best part of the game which is everything after that."
1609695359,w
1609695278,bad story
1609695256,Wait on buying until you see how much effort CDPR Management is putting into fixing this game and bringing it back to what we expected. Bonus: by that time you may be able to get a RTX 3000 graphics card!
1609695241,"Aside from the technical issues, I liked the game a lot. The story was good. The character development was great. I like the way V interacted with other characters. I do wish they let you interact with characters after you finished their quests. I liked the quick hacking stealth. Also wish they did more with the life path. Oh and the cyberwear gear is pretty cool too."
1609695191,"After almost 300h in Cyberpunk 2077 I can say:
I've had a good amount of fun with the Game with minimal issues (since I play on PC & blow the recommended settings out of the water). The thing to know if you are new to playing is: Money isn't easy to come by in the amounts you will need (without ""cheating"" / exploiting), so as soon as you are able to move around, do Side Quests & the Random Quests you can essentially walk up on.
Crafting (Technical Ability) is the Skill Tree you NEED the most, without a doubt. Vehicles aren't worth purchasing when there are so many Free ones throughout the World. Legendary Weapons & Clothes are all over the World too, so walk & look everywhere (or check YouTube). -This paragraph was to save you a lot of Eddies (cash) & give some Insight.-
Different Builds are what really makes this Game a lot of fun too. I have a Character that I play for the fun of the Game with a design that I prefer all in all. I also have other Characters that I play with certain Skills, Weapons, & etc just to try different possibilities ... and these have been a lot of fun to play with.
The Modding Community is beginning to get to work on Cyberpunk 2077 as well, so other than DLC's that are supposed to be coming out for the Game ... Modding it will add a lot in the near future. So expect Cyberpunk 2077 to get more interesting than CDPR even made it."
1609695178,"Let me begin by stating that I have had no issues with my components needing any upgrade after first beginning this game. I experienced hardly any lag and the experience seemed to run pretty smooth. Per my GPU, I have a RX580 with an i5 as my CPU. So I will end the technological portion of my review here.
The game features a story that closely resembles what our world will most likely appear to be in 2077. I personally find this story to be intriguing and pretty frightening! Needless to say, this game could have used so more work pre-publishing, but, I think it is well worth my money."
1609695024,bug
1609694981,"Ever since the game was released, I have been absorbed in the story and gameplay. A little buggy(some of these bugs are actually hilarious), but besides that it's definitely a game worth having.

Funny Bug: Character is in a hotel for a side gig. I accidentally hit the V key which calls for your vehicle while trying to talk to a person that I'm required to speak with for the mission. 5 seconds later, my vehicle comes crashing through the hotel entrance, completely destroying the car but not the hotel walls and it scares the person I'm talking to away. Had to reload my last save file because the person wouldn't let me talk to them after that"
1609694967,"alot of bugs, great story, epic combat, and yes
"
1609694899,way too buggy.. not worth 60 bucks at all
1609694811,"Lots of bugs, but lots of fun."
1609694629,good
1609694627,has some small bugs. so far great to explore. feels like a living city unlike skyrim towns.
1609694466,"I tried to like the game. Didn't have too many bugs that everyone else is complaining about. But it's still a unfinished, bare-bones game. Too many obvious content cuts. Nothing much to do in it. Needs WAY more than just bug fixes."
1609694435,"I pre-ordered and got it day one. Sure, it has some glitches. Nothing absolutely game-breaking in my opinion, though. The game is fun, and it is constantly improving on the bugs and improprieties.
Also, be sure to download any graphics drivers your GPU may need beforehand and RESTART your PC. Could cause problems if you don't.
"
1609694386,"It's a great game, solid gameplay and mechanics. Combat takes advantage of the skills that you decided to spec into so every battle will feel different depending on your playstyle and how you tackle obstacles.

Story-wise the game is good. However, I feel that the choices aren't too weighted and have no impact depending on what you decide to do. For an example, you can choose to help person A or person B. Regardless of who you choose to help one backstabs you and the other just disappears, and in the end you just go along your merry way.

There are some bugs that can affect gameplay and take away from the experience. As soon as you get into the story some logic defying bug happens where people exit your car while walking straight through the front or enemies t-pose in the distance to establish dominance. With time I'm sure that they will iron out the bugs.
"
1609694379,yes good
1609694044,"w8 for 2077 so long time ,great game"

1609693673,big pp energy
1609693650,"Despite having it's bugs that we're all aware of, this game is a lot of fun. The story is decent, and the side quests are just as good if not better. Vibrant city filled with pedestrians in my case made the world come alive. I do hope they address a lot of the bugs and horrible AI but beyond that ill play any DLC coming out."
1609693565,"Bugs? yes.
Fun? yes."
1609693321,It's not a perfect game by far but the storyline is fun and it has tons of sidequests to keep you busy.
1609693288,"I dont even know where to start so im not gonna go into detail but, this game is amazing, ive only ever truly gotten into 3 games, COD, fallout and gta, but now theres a fourth, i was worried i would regret spending 60 dollars on a game i had no idea about but lemme tell you , BEST DECISION IVE EVER MADE. you'll be spending more time in night city than your own life. trust me."
1609693240,Buggy? Sure. Is it going to live up to the super hyped expectations you have build up for 7 years? Probably not. But a great cyperpunk world and a large game that you will enjoy running around in? For sure.

1609693039,"A big fan of CD prodject red have 1000 hours on witcher 3. this game had so much hype from what players expected and they couldnt deliver. this was not witcher 3 quality was much less and because they told us time and time again that it will come out when it is ready, when it came out and wasnt ready the community felt lied to and cheated. My honest opinon is a 6/10 and could go up depending on how fast and well they fix issues and of course the DLC yet to come.
"
1609693032,Atm I can't recommend it. I'm still wondering how a game can be released in a state like this...
1609693022,Fun game
1609692979,"Thoroughly enjoyable story, visualy stunning, imaginative adaptation of the original franchise."
1609692911,"Honestly, I made sure I didn't get too hyped/excited for this game but upon playing it, I discovered how much CD PROJEKT RED lied about the features in this game."
1609692891,"Really good story experience. Game wanted me to feel immersed and I felt immersed. Could use some more customization after the initial character creation but have no doubts stuff like that will be implemented anyways. Only major issue (wasn't even that much of an issue) is the police system. Cops don't need to be spawning behind me out of thin air to beat me down! 

Had a really good time playing the game, leave your over-the-top expectations at the door and just play it for what it is. The game doesn't deserve the bad rep it's getting lately. I've played plenty of games which have had overwhelming praise and was not nearly as immersed into the living world as I was in this game."
1609692888,"Although there are bugs aplenty at the time, I thoroughly enjoyed the game and there is a fair amount to do. Only thing may be that you can get to a point where you do so much damage that you essentially one shot most things depending on the build you go for."
1609692881,"Well I cannot really say much sadly. I really really wanted to like this one but at 43 minutes in I had already crashed twice and could not beat the intro/tutorial because of it. I ended up requesting a refund because of the issues and never really got to even start to enjoy the game.

So I can't recommend the game as it sits maybe in a few months after the bugs are patched and/or it goes on sale, but as it sits 60 dollars is to much for a game with this many issues."
1609692872,"It's no GTA but never wanted to compare it to that game, its pretty decent the story line catches you, there are some glitches but nothing that would stop you from playing the game, would suggest following the story mode then do the side missions, there are a lot to do and can get a bit distracting. Overall I recommend the game."
1609692790,its amazing game cant say anything bad abut it
1609692782,"Obviously there has been a lot of bad press and customer dissatisfaction with plenty of well-deserved criticism of the final product on some platforms. However, all said and done (and bugs/glitches aside) this game is fantastic, not only visually but in terms of the journey within such an amazing backdrop. Genuinely it was an emotional rollercoaster with feelings ranging from euphoria to despair as you became heavily invested in the characters across a variety of rich missions, stories and side quests. Cyberpunk is an epic action-adventure RPG with hours of gameplay that leaves you wishing your life away until the next time you can get your hand on it."
1609692726,"This game is awesome. It like borderlands mixed with a cyber-ninja with a atmospheric world that make you want to be totally immersed into it for hours on end. The strongest attribute that this game has is building world you want to immersed into, but that immersion is ruined my random weird bugs and graphical glitches. There's nothing more jarring than when you're exploring the streets of Night City, smelling the roses and ect, and you see NCP's and cars popping into existence.  Whenever your driving, shadows will render 30 feet before your car and textures will pop in a lot tooo. Inside building the bottles will randomly fall and break for no reason. The performance of this game is ***, I'm running a Ryzen 3700x with RTX 3080 while installed on m.2 drive and play this a game at highish graphics at 2K, max fames i can get  is 100 fps. which isnt that good for pc that can play most game around 144 to 165 fps at Max graphics at 2K. 

 Bottom line what i am trying to say is that this game is so close to being the best game I ever played in 2020, it just needs to have some updates. It still fun even with these glitches but the experience can be a million times better without them. so I recommend to wait a bit, because I wish I did."
1609692684,Great story and graphics
1609692638,"Cyberpunk is a great mix of GTA, Skyrim, and Fallout.  Without a doubt my favorite game ever!  Just make sure you have a spaceship to play it with."
1609692620,"haha what the hell is this, 7 years for this, lack of customization, no big beard ( big cyberhobo beard ), no long hair, no karma system, if you kill or you dont kill, it's still the same, lack of enterable buildings in 2020 wtf !!! the game is empty and you can't rob stores, npc etc, you can't be a good or bad guy, the only good thing about this game is the band samurai, but you can find the music for free on youtube."
1609692467,good story
1609692416,"anyone that complains about glitches and bugs just jumped on the internet bandwagon, 90 hours in and I encountered a total of 3 minor bugs or glitches. which is normal for any game that just came out. The story is crazy well written and even the side quests are interesting and well done."
1609692407,good game on PC
1609692365,"First off, Johnny Silverhand is fucking hot. Secondly, the game is much better on PCs that can handle it, unless you want your PC to turn into a space heater. Yes, there are glitches but there were glitches in Skyrim and people accepted it. So wake the fuck up Samurai, you've got some love to give it."
1609692341,"Tener las expectativas altas no ayudó, creo que gastaron más tiempo en hacer la ciudad hermosamente detallada pero al fin y al cabo está vacía, espero que con futuros parches y dlcs agreguen mucho más contenido."
1609692156,"It was fun and i liked the ending's, not sure if there will be a sequel though."
1609692145,"Before I talk about the story and gameplay, you need a PC to play this game. My GPU is a GTX 1070 and I run at about 40-50 fps on max settings, frame rate drops to 30 when I'm in a crowded area rendering fog. The fps drops in actions scenes but its not as nauseating as you'd expect. Bugs are still an issue but its not really game changing like I've seen from youtube videos. As a male homosapien, I chose to be a girl in the character creator because most comments considered the female counterpart to make more sense in the story. The main story takes around 20 hours to complete, factor in all the side quests and I finished the game at 42 hours. Most open world RPG's like this game are primarily based mostly on side missions than the actual main story. I heard before playing the game that side missions will affect the ending. Failing to do any will grant you the bad ending. I found out after beating the game there really are only 5 side quests needed to unlock all the endings but I wont spoil which ones. There are 3 diverging paths for the final mission, the one I picked had one huge decision to make at the end of the mission and though the actual event was trippy, I think I made the best choice for what was to happen. The game itself is like blade runner mixed with GTA and Doom Eternal. Night city is expansive, detailed, and just looks beautiful. Obviously it will take a while until an open world looks as good as Detroit Become Human, but I think this is nearly close to that level of graphics. The handling of cars feels out of control most times so I just enjoy riding a motorcycle around the world. Stealth is in this game but If I didn't feel like doing it the game gives you enough resources to just run and gun like doom eternal. Playing the game you start to notice how much is missing. Had it not been rushed I think more people would appreciate the game and look past the delays. I just hope CD Projekt Red will be able to rebuild their reputation because I'm loving The Wither 3 and I loved this game. Get this game If you like a rich story, fleshed out world, side quests that compete with other games' story, fast action shooting, role playing, and Keanu Reeves. Its a great game being held back by bugs and performance issues. 9.5/10"
1609692118,It's the first and probably will be the last game that I really loved and ejoyed so much although there are so many bugs and it's all because of the great scenario and Johnny Silverhand!
1609692090,Great game. A few kinks but worth playing on PC.
1609692088,"So in short The game is buggy yea but nothing that makes the game unplayeble, only some visual bugs. The main story and side stories are amazing tho one of them ended too quickly in my opinion (Jefferson Peralez story to be exact). Night City was cool to explore but only on visual part, there isn't really anything to do. 
Overall if Night City had more to offer the game would be a solid 9/10, for now it's more like 7/10"

1609691598,"great game, bugs are temporary issues. i love the look of the game and how in depth you can customize the graphics settings, the character, and further in game you can skill into how you want to play."
1609691588,phenomenal shit if you can run it. hopefully modding community builds in time
1609691480,"Great story, there are a good amount of bugs, but in time with good and healthy development. would recommend, 7/10."
1609691447,It's great even with the bugs and sometimes the graphics going dying while you play
1609691340,"+ My favourite: Brilliant writing. Nearly every quest has some smaller or bigger surpising twists. On top of that every main character is great. I love the story, sidemissions and the endings
+ Stunning graphics, espacially with raytracing
+ Night city is one of the most impressive environments ever in a videogame. Fantastic city design!
+ Wild and great soundtrack
+ I really like the menu and UI design. It's fancy and you can find everything
+ Really deep and exciting rpg system. Many many perks and skills and you can use them very often ingame
+ Really good shooter mechanics and weapon feedback
+ Many ways to play: Brutal gunner, hacker or stealthy
+ Really cool car design. I want my own normade car :)
+ Overwhelming sound design. Especially the city sounds
+ Best hacking mechanics ever in a videogame
+ Love the dialogue system
+ Great motion capture acting
+ The german localization is fantastic!
+ Money is important. Even after 100 h of playtime

- Many many bugs (with Patch 1.06). I had no bigger problems but CD Red still have much to do
- Performance could be better
- CP2077 needs some quality of life features: Alltime mirrors, character pictures for quests and the phone menu, possibillity to chance the haircut and tattoos, new cyberware should be shown with an animation on the chair like the first one from Victor, the taxi and box-quests should have just one mission entry, possibillity to see cloth to buy on your character, better clothes and many more
- I liked the car physics but there is still room for improvement. Smaller cars are a little bit hard to control. In the badlads it's very strange to drive over some hills
- Mission spamming right on the begin of the game
- Too much world map icons
- Boxing system has some potencial but it needs some improvements
- The police ""system"" is stupid. It should get a rework
- Normal NPC and cars despawn way too fast. This system should get a rework, too
- I really liked V's room but it's not very important. Upgrades would be nice

Thanks you so much CD Red for this deep story experience. This is exactely what I wanted. Is CP2077 a masterpiece? No, not yet. But I'm really looking forward for may next playthrough after some patches and some new content :)"
1609691314,"even in its unfinished state cyberpunk is still a very good game
and cdpr will continue too improve it"

"
1609691089,Love it ^^
1609690953,"Sure there are a few bugs, but the incredibly detailed world is fascinating to explore, and the core gameplay loop offers tons of variety. Great for fans of the OG Deus Ex, in particular!"
1609690833,"This game currently should be viewed as a early access game. Yes, there are some bugs happening, but over time this will be fixed. The story is interesting and the gameplay is fun. Even with all the bugs, the game still looks amazing (and I'm playing on a potato GPU)."
1609690804,"Like any game that releases in our world of crunch and deadlines, Cyberpunk has it's bugs. I would argue that few are game breaking, and even those few require a save and reload to fix. That being said, the game is in-depth and has a great story to tell. I've found a majority of the side gigs to be satisfying and hunting down criminals throughout Night City has been something that while occasionally repetitive, is still rewarding each time. Also, the interplay between the player and a specific NPC is always hilarious or heartwarming, depending on the choices you make and I don't think they could have chosen a better actor for the part. The pop culture references are sprinkled throughout the game and are fun to find and identify (check out the bottom perk of the Crafting skill), adding yet another layer to an already deep game. All in all, I'd say it's a solid 8/10 from it's beginnings with the bugs but I'm sure that will increase as patches are released and issues are addressed. If you can handle the occasional bug and need to reset, this game should definitely be your next purchase."
1609690720,does it have bugs yes. But when you play this game and see the massive world and see all the choices you can make. even times when you think you don't have a choice you actually do. its worth every moment
1609690680,"The game about cyberpunk is rare. I like it so much. This game is good but it works badly. So many troubles with performance. I have a lot of game crashes in some locations. Also, there are a lot of bugs. I don`t like to play it right now. May be later when all problems will be fix the game will nice but not now. I recommend to buy it in 6 months after relese."
1609690663,unbelievably fun
1609690477,"i love this game thank you CDPR

! i wont even mention the ""you know whats"" because i really don't mind them at all (nothing to rage about) i know it just takes time
and i see no reason to doubt that this will be a crisp clean game soon

cant wait for multiplayer!"
1609690524,"Do I love this game? Yes.
Would I recommend it? Gosh no.

The game through all of the bugs is great. The story is amazing, the characters, acting, animation, all great. A lot of this content takes place in dialogues or cutscenes so most of the good stuff isn't tainted. The rest...

Bugs constantly. I mean constantly. Cars spawn in the ground more often than on top of it, NPCs T-posing everywhere, invisible props, NPCs looking through walls or discovering hidden bodies out of nowhere. Teleporting into walls and getting stuck, glitching off a physics object and getting yeeted 400m out into the desert. Ranged combat is okay but melee is completely broken. Speaking of completely broken, the economy and crafting. You can create infinite money in the base vanilla game by crafting special grenades or medpacs and just recycling them. Infinite components. There's a skill that they took out but just blurred over. The whole thing is riddled with holes and errors. Frequently will these detract from your experience out in the world or just straight up break your game.

I'm confident CDPR will make this game into a jewel if they're allowed. And as it stands I love it now even. But gosh is there room for improvement.

TL:DR if you know youre gonna like the game and can ignore bugs etc, go for it. Otherwise, wait."
1609690383,"Don't believe the hype! Between the PR promises (which were impossible) and the hours put in by the code monkeys (which are incredible) everybody is still bound to have at least 1 or 2 'OMG-This-Is-What-I-Want-To-Play-But-Wait-It's-Not-There?' complaints. Mine are wall-climbing and more cyberspacey cyberstuff.
However, that's easily corrected with a couple more fix patches and 1 or 2 (Free,we earned that much) big content DLC's, which I'm certain will be provided along 2021.(Wishfull thinking at it's best)

However, for those who havent been completely put off by the early stage glitches and (occasionally over the top) outrage following, there is already a beautiful sprawling city to explore, exploit and to commit various acts of mischief in.It can only grow bigger and better.

(Me,I'm hoping the game will incorporate some form of coop for bigger missions, really get a crew going)"
1609690302,"All in all I loved this game and highly recommend it to anyone who reads this.
The story is deep, the game play is fun and engaging and there are countless things to see and do in Night City.

The game has its share of bugs, being that it is a new release but none of which that I experienced were game breaking. If anything the ones I did encounter were hilarious most of the time. 

Well worth the price tag"
1609690240,honestly the bugs ruined it for me it doesnt run as intended and the framerate etc is just not good at all
1609690189,Great game
1609690178,.
1609690153,"Cyberpunk 2077 is a beautiful and stylish game with an interesting story, memorable characters and decent gameplay, but woefully short on additional content and suffering from bugs and balance issues. In terms of visuals, it is, undoubtedly, one of the best games of the year. Night City is as huge as it is detailed, and, even though the textures are not exactly awe-inspiring, the vibrant colors and, especially, the lighting are to be commended. Even without ray tracing, the lighting and reflections in this game are among the best I have seen; in fact, ray tracing doesn't make a whole lot of difference and is certainly not worth the performance hit if your PC struggles with it. The story is engaging and well-written, even though it leaves some important questions unanswered; you will certainly be tempted to rush through it without even bothering with side quests. Gameplay-wise, this is a first-person shooter/stealth game. The stealth aspect is solidly implemented, if nothing special: you sneak around, distract or incapacitate enemies using quickhacks, then take them out either lethally or non-lethally. Unfortunately, the game doesn't really reward stealth or the non-lethal approach; at best, the contract giver will say a few words of praise. The shooting part is fun, too, but only when your guns and skills are sufficiently upgraded; in the beginning, especially, on the hard difficulty, it can be downright painful. In fact, the first major shootout in Cyberpunk 2077 was one of the worst gaming experiences I had ever had, and even had me considering dropping the game altogether. In part, bugs were to blame, but, mainly, it was the level system that CDPR had lifted straight from Witcher 3 without thought to how well it would work in a shooter. Basically, if your opponent is of a much higher level, you have to shoot him a trillion times to kill him (yes, even in the head), which is simply ridiculous. At least, most firefights can be avoided using stealth, although that brings me to another drawback. The main story has two boss fights, and the first one may come as something of a shock to a player that has been favoring the stealthy approach and distributing his skill points accordingly. It happens with absolutely no warning, and, depending on your current skills and weapons, you may even have to go back to an earlier save (assuming there is one, ha-ha) and do some farming, or else lower the difficulty. The game's real flaw, however, are the side quests. Oh, there is no shortage of them, but 90% of them are exactly the same: go to a place and take everyone out/steal some stuff. Yes, there is a story behind each one... assuming you want to open the journal and read through it, which I'll wager not many people will do. I'd rather there were half as many side quests — fewer, even — but with an actual plot. The only side quests really worth doing are the character quests. Each character you encounter is memorable, and so are their stories; besides, completing a certain character's storyline unlocks an additional ending. Speaking of characters, Johnny Silverhand, who will be your constant companion, is kind of a letdown. Unlike the Joker in Arkham Knight, or Vlodimir von Everec in Witcher 3, who were fun to interact with and offered an interesting perspective on things, Silverhand is, well, just a dude. Other than the parts where he takes control, or comments on people he used to know, he really doesn't make much of a contribution. His charisma is lacking, not so much because of Keanu Reeves's acting, but because of how the character is written. Like so many other things about this game, he feels unfinished, and, in this case, it is not something a patch can fix. As of this moment, Cyberpunk 2077 is a flawed, but fun game. It is not, and never will be on the same level as Witcher 3, but it is a memorable gaming experience, all the same. It is probably best to wait for a month or two to get the most out of it."
1609690146,May aswell just buy GTA...
1609690015,G E T T I N G C O C K
1609689974,"I have encountered a few bugs, although none have been truly game breaking. It takes you out of the immersion temporarily, but the game is great enough to keep me engaged."
1609690136,"No Spoilers

Feels like basically just a futuristic version of skyrim without cool mods. Just about everything about it is mediocre and disappointing for a triple A title in 2020.

Lame combat, the skill tree is just % changes of damage and no abilities will never change how you approach challanges, hacking is just clicking buttons in a menu, the main story is bland and not even really about your own character, the game badly needs quality of life improvements for example with inventory management, decisions you make never matter apart from one or two lines at the end of a mission, the lifepaths you choose at the beginning are a joke and will never affect anything either, the game is buggy as hell...

The side stories are really the only thing that is genuinely good about it."
1609690147,"The game isn't optimized at this point. You are most likely going to come across reviews saying there are no issues, but many are running on powerful PC rigs and things varies from user to user. Wait for the upcoming updates, as we did when Witcher 3 was released.

The game will with no doubt be a 10/10 after some time. But for now I can't recommend this title."
1609785930,"After around 40 hours of total playtime, I finally finished the main storyline of Cyberpunk 2077 - and I felt like I should share my experience and thoughts with the game and its different aspects. Please keep in mind this is not an in-depth review, more of a surface-level analysis of the game. I would like to start with the positive aspects of the game, as I feel there is far too much negativity surrounding the game at the moment - as well as the fact that the positives far outweigh the negatives. 

The atmosphere and detail are where the game shines brightest in my opinion as it successfully captures the stunning beauty of Night City while also showcasing all of its darker elements - all while feeling naturally consistent and immersive. Brimming with small details that you wouldn't notice if you were just running around blindly, not taking the time to slow down and soak it all in. That in itself is almost like a reward for both player and developer, as the extra work a developer may put into a small area may be missed by most players, but those who do happen to spot it can feel the love and care behind it. However, in the games current state this can act as a double-edged sword as it makes the rougher / unfinished aspects of the game stand out like a sore thumb - I will get to that later though.

The quest design for the most part is exceptional, especially the side quests. The natural flow through quest chains feels organic and makes you care for the characters and their stories. Quests can pop up randomly that change all the plans you had in your head, all for this story you had no idea existed until a few moments ago. The only downside with this is that these quests that pop up can (and will) stack, and you will prioritize the more interesting sounding ones first - so when you go back to the ones you brushed off after the initial message, you have no idea what started it or what's going on. To put it bluntly, it makes you feel overwhelmed at times. The main story itself is incredibly short in my opinion, nevertheless, I do like the themes that it explores (especially in the final act), even if it has been done better in other forms of media.

When it comes to CDPR games, the combat is usually the weakest aspect of the game, and Cyberpunk 2077 is no exception. Easily the buggiest part of the game gets shown off in all its glory, with AI that barely works and instant-death situations that have no explanation behind them. It's a mess, and I hope this gets patched down the line before the release of the expansions. Quick-hacking feels very surface-level, as it doesn't seem like it's worth the effort most of the time. I'm a fan of stealth games, however, running and gunning in this game is faster and more efficient than the alternative. It's just not worth the trouble.

Lastly, the bugs - and boy there are a lot of them. On patch 1.06 there is a myriad of bugs that plague the game, with a handful that soft-locked the game for me. While the bugs did not completely ruin my experience of the game it must be said that it is a massive shame that the game released in this state. As you're playing you can see the effort and love the developers put in - you can see the diamond trying to shine through but it is constantly battling against itself through the overabundance of bugs and glitches. Even if it's a small visual bug, it pulls you right out of the game, which hurts the immersion that the game tries so hard to achieve.

In conclusion, if you can wait a year or two for the bugs to be fixed, as well as the promised DLC expansions to be released - I would wholeheartedly recommend it. The game is perfectly playable at the moment, but you will get the best experience if you wait."
1609689866,"Honestly, this game is worth the play, the bugs, and the effort. After 100+ hours, I am still wanting to play, and the prospect of DLC has me eagerly ready for more. Night City is beautiful and deadly. The main story is great, but its the side missions that really flesh out the world and the game as a whole. My only critiques are about the A.I., mini maps, and some minor bugs, but knowing CDPR and having seen how much the Witcher 3 evolved and was fixed post release, it doesn't have me worried. IT might not be quite the masterpiece that the Witcher 3 was, but its a game that if you're considering buying it, you should just pull the trigger now."
1609689757,"Yes there are some bug but they're relaively minimal. One of the best RPG's i've ever played. Look at my hours played, you dont get to do 100hrs+ on a game that's shallow and crashes every 2 mins."
1609689616,"After finishing cyberpunk and now going with another playthrough, I can say that I do enjoy the game. 

However, I do NOT recommend it to anyone, not yet. I simply cannot excuse CD Projekt Red for releasing the game in this state. I cannot excuse the way they treated their employees and nor can I excuse alll those promises about how the game would be, being broken.

While I do enjoy the game and the story, there's just so many ways that this game failed to deliver promise, topped with all that abuse on their workers, and it shows. So many mechanics are broken, some playstyles just suck or don't make sense, so much has been left in the cutting floor and the more I play this game, the more I sigh as I see more stuff that's broken or left unfinished or just bugs the hell out.

Do not buy this game, wait a couple of years, maybe then this game will actually be finished. I can only hope that CD Projekt Red learns from this absolute ""shitstrom,"" especially on the whole worker abuse shenanigans."
1609689567,"Awesome graphic and world. Lots of awesome NPC's. Some you will love, some not so much. 
Game runs very good, but has some bugs that should be fix. Overall very good game to play and enjoy it's possibilities."
1609689379,If you understand your PCs limitations this game is great. Im running it with a Ryzen 5 2600 and a Vega 56 with 32GB ram. Runs stable over 60FPS at Max settings. There are many bugs and glitches but all in all the game is still great. It definitely should have been delayed for more optimization for PC. There are a lot of rough edges and bad collisions. BUT it is still a good game at its base even with missing features
1609689303,"Half decent PC and this thing runs well enough. On a RTX2070 with an i5 from a couple of gens back, I had to drop the res from UWHD to 2560x1440 but I just love Night City. Couple of amusing bugs but no crashes. It looks great, it sounds superb. Storyline is decent, some obvious smoke & mirrors but the city still feels packed with activity. 80 hours in, not got to half way through the main storyline."
1609689196,"This game is next level. Bugs yeah whatever, the few I have seen on PC will be gone soon, and what will remain is a great game, no matter what all the crybabies are on about (getting a bit boring now)."
1609689449,"*SPOILER* *SPOILER* *SPOILER* *SPOILER*

I enjoyed Cyberpunk 2077 a lot, but the game has so much wasted potential. It could've been the best RPG / action game ever, but there are some major issues with it.

1) Story progresses too fast. Even though I enjoyed the story, I felt like it was rushed. I wanted to learn more about Night City with the main story, not by reading some random USB cards. For example speaking for the Nomad backstory, why not make a prologue that shapes your backstory as a character? The decisions that I make in the prologue should define my own character and personality.

Also why the fuck do I care about Jackie? After the first introduction mission, a cut scene shows up and shows you the adventures of V and Jackie. Why the fuck are we watching that instead of playing it? There was a lot of potential content there and we are watching a montage. I wanted the game to make me care about the NPC's, the city, the problems. But the emotional connection with the characters were missing. Evelyn died? Why the fuck should I care? Jackie died? Oh we did 3-4 shitty missions with him, so I barely know that guy. But the game wants me to care about Jackie as if he was my lifelong friend.
This problem could easily be solved by making the progression a little slower. Make the story as if we are climbing the crime ladder with my pal Jackie, let me share the same emotions with him (Surprise, anger, sorrow) so I make a bond with him. Same for the other characters as well. That's how you make the game alive, by making me feel emotional for the characters and allow me to bond with them. Red Dead Redemption and GTA series are perfect examples for creating stories like this.

2) Bugs and AI. AI is dumb as fuck and there are lots of little bugs in the game. I expected better from a company with over 1000 employees and 7 years of development time. Compare this game with GTA V and Cyberpunk 2077 is a joke.

Although the game has disappointed me, I still recommend this game to everyone. I had lots of fun playing it. But it could've been so so much better :("
1609688760,"My biggest gripe with cyberpunk 2077 is that there weren't enough dicks in it. Seriously, there are naked women all over the place but the only tip of a schmeat you get to see is the one your character is packing. I've had all of the same sex-sex scenes and at no point do you ever see a piece of meat. I even watched youtube videos of the chicks going with the prostitutes and you never see a dong there either.
Are polish people afraid of penises? I'm starting to think that's the case.
I really loved the setting of this game and as soon as mods come out I'll probably put another 100 hours into it."
1609688589,Fun stuff.  Buggy but not to the point that a reload couldn't solve the issue or at least the bug made me laugh.  I feel this game will be 10X better in another 6 months.
1609688296,10/10 its been awesome. violently bugy but they're features not bugs
1609688206,"A very good RPG vith a very,very sad endings. Definitely worth a run."
1609688173,"No thanks, buggy-ass releases really piss me off.  2 hr refund window after i sit that long trying to clear a bug to exit an encounter?  FU and your little game too."
1609688156,"The positives outweigh the negatives. sure there's some bugs but that's to be expected when CDPR were under so much pressure to release the game. Can't complain about a buggy ""unfinished"" game on release when people demanded it be released in the first place despite it having originally been pushed back. The next gen graphics are phenomenal, the story is amazing although granted a little short and the open world aspect is amazing. An imperfect game that has the potential to be outstanding with a couple of patches and bug fixes."
1609688068,Despite some bugs this game is extremely fun. I would certainly recommend it. None of the bugs i experienced where game breaking anyways.
1609688058,There is a somewhat nice game under that mess.
1609688039,"Despite the initial bugs it is a phantastic game.
The story is thought through, the characters have a lot of depth.
"
1609687984,"Glitches, random deaths, and great story. parts of the story brought a tear to my eye with how immersive it is. Great fucking game"
1609687934,a
1609687905,Really good game
1609687879,"Despite only having 2 hours on the game right now. I think it's a good game and 100% worth it, the launch was fairly bad with glitches, but in a few patches it will be fixed. I am not that far into the story but from as much as i have seen it's a good story. But the main thing holding this game together is the d|ck size changer element."
1609687823,"After 80 hours, I've enjoyed some aspects of cyberpunk, but overall it leaves me disappointed and with a bad taste in my mouth. It's especially frustrating to go back to the marketing material and hear cdpr talk about how advanced the world and NPCs are. What a load of BS. The world and NPCs are about as smart as a 1990s windows xp screensaver.

*spits on ground*

Thanks for the witcher cdpr, but you lost a fan with this one. This game regrettingly gets a 4/10 from me, and cdpr deserves every bit of blowback they're getting."
1609687745,"Reviewing cyberpunk at launch is kind of tricky, since as most people know, the game came out in a not-so-great technical state. As of the day i'm reviewing this, not even a month after the release, it's undeniable that CDPR has to put some very needed work into optimisation and bug fixing.
*that being said,*
This is pretty much where my complaints start and end. My experience with Cyberpunk 2077 (note: as someone who doesn't play very many RPG's) was overall VERY positive.
The game is not perfect, even aside the bugs and low frames; to give an extremely specific and niche example, i think that the way in witch certain animation can trigger by doing powerful attacks with melee weapons should be reworked, as it can be frustrating to be stuck in a 1.5 second long animation mid-combat, especially considering you are not invulnerable to attacks during this time, witch on hard mode, the difficulty i played through on, basically means you're screwed, unless some miracle happens.
I am sure there are other certain small annoyances depending on what kind of character build you have, however, at least for the things i found, these problems seem to be very minor and very easy to fix.

Finally, without going into spoilers, Story-wise, Soundtrack-wise and Aesthetic-wise, the game is absolutely top tier, in my opinion.
This game is a 9/10, and i'm confident that in a year or so it will be aven better.

I think that the most important thing to take away from the launch of Cyberpunk 2077 is that the people who actually worked on the game, those being the artists, voice actors, sound engineers, composers, writers and designers who made this game put incredible passion and love into it, WHILE the people at the top over at CDPR, the managers and PR people, the people who worked their employees to the bone trying to suck out all the money they possibly could from the game while also exploiting their workers should be kicked the fuck out and never be allowed to work on any game ever again :)"
1609687726," I refer to Cyberpunk 2077 as one of the most immersive games I've played in years. The attention to detail, the dialogue and game graphics are what most game developers should aspire to achieve. I highly recommend this to any gamer, especially those that enjoys first person shooters, roll playing games and story rich content. Buy the game and support the developers who have put years of hard work and dedication into this masterpiece."
1609687536,"I have more bugs after Hotfix 1.06 then ever before. Nice bug fix.
This game was in the end of the making probably rushed and hyped to the heaven. Don't buy it right now wait some Months.
This givers me a No Man's Sky fealing."
1609687470,"Very disappointed with CDPR. Compared with Witcher3 and RDR2, this game mechanics is awful.

Leaving the bugs aside, I encounter the following:

Minimap is to zoomed, cannot use it while driving fast.
NPCs movement and ""bullet"" interactions are from 10yrs ago, compared to RDR2 is like...day and night.
Car/bike driving mechanics is an absolute dump, I felt like always drifting, 0 engagement to do  ride quests.
The AI...was this an early alpha or???
Quest strategy same as  Witcher3...nothing original, boring!
Graphics optimizations = NONE!! I had to ""tweak and trick"" everything to get 10-20 FPS more.
I don't know why, but during game time, graphics were reset to low or something, and every character became blue-dark skinned.

This is not a game ready to be release, they are missing ~1-2yrs of work. Compared to Witcher3 and RDR2...extreme disappointment."
1609687370,"Like all said, the game is under development. Right now we have what should have become one of the best game ever, but become 30 of 100%. Not worth it, at least for now.
Why?
1-Too much scripts, no free choices
2-Mods, talents are not interesting at all. Most of all just damage, armor and etc. (Hey guys, you should play Deus Ex at least to see what means Augments)
3-Devs cut the game just right till release, no promises

I can continue, but you know this as well"
1609687303,very immersive with stunning graphics..very confusing game though. very hard for me to understand what the heck is going on. the storyline is all over the place. no tutorial for this very complicated game. took me 8hours just to get the hang of this game
1609687169,"Even though the game has the occasional bug, and I can't run RTX settings without killing my framerate, I'm still enjoying walking around Night City and seeing where the story takes me. I have a 3800X, 16 Gb of RAM, and a 2070 Super. I'm able to get above 60 FPS using Alex from Digital Foundry's settings. I'm happy that I don't have to worry about the console problems, and I know that any major bugs will be fixed over time. I don't think the harsh criticisms of this game affect my experience."

2) Get a proper RTX rig
3) Enjoy a game that was worth the wait"
1609687094,It's buggy as all heck but I'm having fun with the parts that work. Solid story and cool world. I just remember the time when games released when they were finished and they might have well delayed this one again. I'm having a good time but I would honestly suggest most people wait until it's out of beta...
1609687062,"It's alright I guess - nowhere near where I would like it to be, but decent, I'd give it a 7/10.

The game looks really beautiful and to my surprise even runs 'well enough' on my 5 year old laptop. It's also performing reasonably well on my somewhat dated PC (i7-7700K and RTX 2070). There are some issues that really need to get ironed out, like the blindingly bright bloom effect when you're on the roads sometimes. I liked the story in general, I just wished it was more clear what some dialog options do, especially when you're under time pressure to react. Some side quests are really nice and have an interesting background story, but some of them feel like a low-effort copy paste that could as well have been a random open world event. I wish there were more high quality side quests. On that note, there are quite a few scripting bugs that lock you out of completing some quests - I experienced this happening with 3 or 4 quests (all of them early gigs).

Where the game falls flat for me is UI and itemization, as well as the open world.
Organizing the mess that is your backpack is a nightmare. The UI is slow and tedious, upgrading materials can't even be done in batch, you gotta upgrade each one manually by holding down a button. Most items I collected were inferior to the ones I already had - stats are random and you can't modify the number of sockets (tbh I didn't bother with crafting much, it seems like a pain).
As for the open world - I don't even know why the wanted status is even there. Cops suddenly pop out of every corner, but if you run away for a few seconds they just lose interest and you're good to go again. Gangs might as well not be there, nobody cares what you're doing in their district - as far as I can tell there isn't even a reputation system.

All things considered, I had fun with the game - it gets carried by its interesting characters and the urge for exploration. But I do recommend waiting for a few more months for critical bugfixes and improvements before picking it up.

As a last word, shame on your crunch practices CDPR - stop treating your workers like trash."
1609686954,Great game just fix the bugs hh...
1609686951,"Despite all of the bad reviews about bugs, I really love this game."
1609686914,"Love this game,  a fantastic blend of on he rails story and over the hill wanderings as you please."
1609686781,YES
1609686719,"Awesome RPG, But runs like poop ATM"
1609686667,Plenty of freedom and room to grow in this game.  Beautiful and imaginative world.  Highly recommended.
1609686540,"Waited for this game for many years like everyone of us. Yes it has (many) bugs. Yes it demanded (very) good hardware. Yes the AI is retarded, physics has it flaws. 
Nevertheless I had a blast and finished the game with about 70 hours. Still loads of things to do after game completion, and a shame that haters gonna hate and would pass on a gem like this."
1609686471,pretty good.
1609686409,"The game runs very well after second patch, on ultra with no raytracing. I have a 2070 with 8 gigs of video ram. 

I LOVE IT!"
1609686294,I think this game is superb. Runs great on my MSI GS75 Stealth laptop. I've had no bugs or crashing and am enjoying the game immensely.
1609686283,"It may get poor reviews on PS4 and Xbox 0ne but it runs great on my PC.  Very smooth.  And awesome.  If you liked Deus Ex, it is somewhat similar only cooler and grittier"
1609686165,Great game on par with the GTA games but it is poorly optimized and doesn't run well around a third of the time. It has very pretty graphics.
1609686066,Its GTA V meets Watchdogs meets DC Browns Delorian and i love every minute of it.
1609686009,"After a few weeks the game is now more stable than it was at launch and I can finally recommend this game. After finishing the game I can say this is definitely a game worth picking up, but maybe wait for a few more patches."
1609685995,"Only issue I have is why can't you customize your character at a ripper doc. There's even a side quest centered around plastic surgeon rippers lol. The amount of customization options are actually really lacking. Can't have cybernetic limbs or anything like npcs can, and a lot of npc outfits aren't available to players. In terms of gameplay it's really fun though and it's immersive as hell. If you've got a good enough PC to handle it, the game is really pretty too."
1609685888,"Awesome story, EPIC game. Bugs of course but I expect them so it doesint bother me. Nothing game breaking aside from the upgrade bug with Quest icon Iconics. So wait for a fix an dont upgrade or lose your carry capacity. But knew there was gonna be bugs as there was a delay in the release. Publishers were likely pushing them to release not to mention the idiot public resorting to death threats to the Devs over the delay. Fuken pathetic. That's the real reason we have bugs, people so damn impatient for them to finish the fuken game. Idiots. My vote 9/10. Fun as fuck an awesome stories right down to the Side quests are borderline main quests in other games."
1609685836,"(played over 100 hours mostly offline, bad connection)

It is a good game. I havent read any review, but im pretty sure about that, you can read such things like tons of bugs, and unplayable. Well, i was not able to play in the first two weeks, cas my game just crashed as soon i passed the city border, or left the starter area building stepping outside to the city.  Now i can play, and here what i experienced: visual bugs or graphic related bugs. Not much. But there are some. I saw T posed NPCs. So what? Not a big deal. Jumped into an area once where shouldnt be visited. Flickering. Wow! Am i suppose to be surprised? Motorcycle stucked in pixels the middle of the dump field (if you get there you wont be surprised such thing happanes)
Keep that in mind: Bugs can be fixed. As i know CD RED they will working on it, like they did with Witcher 3.  It is proofed, for me by able to actually walk in the city itself. And they keep working on it. I highly recommend to buy it. it is worth it. If you worry your game wont start like mine, wait for 1-2 months. I will bokk you as a not NC material :D

About play-stiles:

Solo (Aka: i got a gun and thats good enough!) Well, you can kick in the front door, and kill (or naturalise) everyone without any issue. There will be some mission where sneak is optional, however, evn if you massmurder everyone, you can sucessfully finish any mission.

Cyberninja: (Aka: Who need guns???) Now its something i was missing since some time. You dont have to kill anyone not even knock them down if not thats the actual mission objective. Except some shooting which are scripted and you are in a vehicle try blowing off some persuder you dont evn need to fire a single shot, or make your blade/blunt/fist bloody. Not long ago i just found the A22B CHAO legendary blueprint. If you get there you will know which mission i talking about. I did it by hurting one single thing, The target. Only the target. Noone else. Nah thats an achivement for ninjas for sure.

Now, i think, its getting TL;DR SOOO much so i just go back and gonna replay this game without take any kind of weapon into my hand (except those very few moments when the game force you to do so like i mentioned) Cas it worth it. Worth the 60, worth the time, and worth the struggles with the bugs."
1609685710,"A masterpiece in terms of game design and gameplay, that unfortunately suffered from a flawed release as well as from the expectations of people having grown to specific. When you buy this game, do not expect ""GTA Cyperbunk"" - expect ""The Cyber-Witcher in first person"". This is an open world game, but it is not an unlimited sandbox like GTA or TC's Wildlands. This game takes itself seriously, despite the ""crazy"" character design. I rarely play through an entire game in what was essentially one session only interrupted by me sleeping and eating, but I did for this one.

Yes: The game is still having some issues in terms of bugs, but for me it ran fluently and without stutters and crashes on maxed out setting (granted, on a brand new high end PC).
The game design, the beautiful graphics, and the incredible, menacingly pretty gameworld make more than up for the hiccups it still has. None of the bugs I have seen were gamebreaking - it is mostly smaller UI glitches and occasional artifacts at this point.

If you want to approximate the gameplay of this game in one sentence:
Think Borderlands and The Witcher got a child and that child is really really into dark and grim dystopian literature."
1609685687,"Game is alright, kinda buggy and if you play long enough, you start to notice the cut content as some missions or areas just feel like there's something missing. Give it some time to hopefully improve the game but overall, still alright."
1609685682,"Pretty fun game, feels like a mix of Division 2 and watchdogs with some Gta aspects thrown in. if you liked watchdogs or the division series you'll like this game."
1609685448,"Cyberpunk is very difficult game to rate, as all the RPGs on their release days, on one hand - shitton of bugs and performance issues. On the other hand - well-written story, interesting setting and lively world.
Cyberpunk really is a good game even with so much criticism and affairs it is surrounded by.
Story and quests (the things that make RPG games RPG games) are brilliant and characters and their development is very intriguing. The world and it's history is not THAT unique as one new to the genre would say, but they're still decent competitors in many other artworks by other people. 
I personally would recommend Cyberpunk if not as a game, than as an introduction to the cyberpunk genre because this is what it handles very well."
1609685430,I don't see what all the complaning is about I love this game finaly got a skyrim fallout combo game set in the futcher whats not to love.
1609685259,"Don't play this game until CDPR or modders have completely overhauled it, god bless."
1609685178,"Amazing game, It still has a few bugs but overall one of the greatest of all time."
1609685167,"It's pretty GG. Bought a new system just to play it mind you, but hey all in a pc gamer's days work right!?!  (it was time to upgrade anyway)"
1609685167,"Great game, Great Story, some minor glitches. Fun Factor is high!"
1609685158,"The story is very good. I do feel like they left some stuff out to make the release date. But, overall the level of detail in the game, the immersiveness, and the graphics are awesome."

1609684708,"it good, much fun"
1609684593,"It is clear that this ambitious game has had its trouble for the past 8 yrs, I would have preferred that the people in charge of the game would have given more time to its release rather than rushing it out the door. Missions that when completed, do not log as saved, glitches requiring game resets, I could go on. I truly respect the work that the devs have done to date, but honestly this is one of the most frustrating games I have had to endure for a while. When it works, it works and is exciting to play as an enhanced person. The rest of the time is spent trying to find game breaking ways to complete simple missions like the Tarot search, one mission I completed by glitching through the window of a destroyed building, the game did save once I completed it but when I logged off and returned, I was unable to view the Tarot and my time was spent trying to repeat my glitch. Fucking appalling. Again, thanks to the work done in trying to replicate this game, but honestly I cannot promote purchase of this game until a heap of updates are released, Then in will evolve into the game that some players want.
My last statement is fairly poignant. WTF is with games that have mods like ""Pants of incredible Sharp-shooting, The legendary level of my armour/weapon should be cosmetic and achieved in view at my lair. What is the logic behind my gun being able to target or impart more damage because I have a Bandanna of Wondrous bullshit? You shoot and hit/miss with whatever projectile mechanics that works with your game, imparting subsequent damage. It is not rocket science, just physics.
Long winded review, but hope the devs at least take a look at it.  As I said, when the game works, it is a blast."
1609684490,"It is a very fun game, but is also a buggy game. I had fun though"
1609684390,"Last Gen Console memes aside, I am enjoying every minute of Cyberpunk 2077.

1609684367,"Lots of bugs, mouse control is super heavy (mouse lag, not smooth/snappy like something like Valorant), but still pretty cool concepts.  Great art."

1609684325,"This damn game crashes so damn much. It's unplayable.  It's a great game, but the instability is pissing me pretty much the fuck off. At this rate, I'm going to need a damn refund."
1609683845,"It all started when Deus Ex met  GTA and they had this gem. Hi, this is Cyber Punk 2077 and its kind of weird,buggy but so good. The world pulls you in. I think the game was at least a year or two from being polished but let the patches roll."
1609683842,"is not terrible, is just not what it was promised"
1609683740,"Night City has a promise for you. A dream, freedom, to become someone, to be remembered. The ending to those promises are different than real life. While in real life you rot in your own head, in Night City you rot in an alley chasing down some lead to become someone, and then no one remembers you. 

Cyberpunk 2077 is bittersweet. 
In the characters and their stories, in V and their endings, Silverhand and the endless question of ""did he truly change?"". The bittersweetness in the stories that you fall in love with yet feels unfinished. In the beauty of the city that might get cut by graphical bugs or lack of frames. But don't fool yourself thinking those things will take away anything from your experience. 

No matter how cruel Night City is, everyone still wants to live it. Cyberpunk 2077 is similar. It will be something you always remember, something you hold with you for a long time. So don't let the media or the corps tell you how you feel about it. Decide for yourself. For me, and many others, this game is truly worth it. 

The complex feeling of love and hating for Night City, the words ""never stop fighting"" - It all were there as the ending happened. For me, the game truly succeeded in telling what it set out to be."
1609683556,Hideo Kojima should be a love interest for V
1609683492,"All though this game  has received heaps of bad reputation for being released buggy and seamingly unfinished as well as not delivering promised content, I gotta say, it was a hell of a ride through the main story and side missions. Don't get me wrong here - there were bugs here and there, but they didn't break the game - at least for me. The only thing I consider a little negative was the lack of choices you had through out some of the gigs and side missions, meaning there wasn't a dialog option for some quests I really wanted to choose (e.g. sinner man and a few others). 

From the gameplay standpoint it was not really overwhelmingly good but still fun to play. Cyberpunk has a - well - somewhat basic/light skill system that kind of forces you into a role and you are pretty restricted in building your character in a way that doesn't allow crazy combinations like in other games e.g. divinity original sin. 
But again, gameplay was fun and felt rewarding. 

Storywise it was a well crafted game with lots of atmosphere and really good voice acting all though I would have wished for more impact of the live path I chose through out the game and the ending. I mean you can roleplay it (how I did it) but no one forced you to. In other words if you're playing a nomad you could as well choose the corpo ending if you wanted to. 

All in all I have to say, despite some minor glitches and slightly disappointing game design choices I would really recommend playing this game, since it delivers a wide variety of narrative missions, an interesting and fresh gameplay (as a netrunner) as well as an rpg open world not set in a medievalish fantasy world :> 

That said, go play cyberpunk and enjoy night city, the city that never sleeps."
1609683477,"   This game is an absolute joke in comparison of what was promised to us over the years. Faulty graphics,  areas not loading in for around half a minute, police AI just spawning behind you out of the blue and not to mention the lack of interaction with random AI around the city,. Let alone having a huge decrease in the population compared to what was shown to us before it was even released. I am sure this, aligned with many other peoples opinion on this will greatly impact any future gaming sales they produce in the years to come. You get what you give in a sense, and they gave us a heaping amount of smelly garbage on a shiny chrome plate."
1609683469,"Very buggy. Get a refund if you have already bought it. If not, stay away from this one."
1609683372,the best game ever
1609683440,"Here's my spoiler-free review of Cyberpunk after 100%-ing the game and completing all endings. 

I've always had an affinity for the Dystopian Future/Cyberpunk genre and I followed CP2077's development pretty closely. It's completely fair to say that this game has plenty of shortcomings, these primarily being NPC AI, limited lifepath diversity, bugs, & the limited player customisation. 

However, 

These things are all pretty passable for me personally and for most people who are playing on PC. I haven't had a single-player experience akin to this since I first played Skyrim. 

- No other game comes close to CP2077 in terms of scenery and imagery, it's beautifully crafted and I would say is the focal point of the game, I've never been so invested or immersed in a world like this. 

- The side-characters of the game are incredibly polished each with their own personalities, backgrounds & goals. Interaction with them is also a major highlight of the game, they feel very real and their associated quests are compelling and you actually feel for them.

- The main story of the game is short but very impactful, I constantly wanted to unravel more and the choices you make in side quests and with side-characters can shape how your story plays out in the long run. It keeps you hooked and there are numerous iterations of endings which gives it decent replay value. 

- It's pretty clear that CDPR took a lot of time creating the soundtrack for this game, there are a plethora of songs on the radio that are all unique and are fitting to the Cyberpunk genre, some of the pieces for the main story are also unbelievable, I personally enjoyed Rite of Passage, Isometric Air, Kerry's Guitar Theme & [spoiler]Johnny's Grave[/spoiler]

There are plenty more things for me to talk about but I would 100% recommend CP2077 to any PC player and I think in the coming months with patches, DLC & (hopefully) modding support the game will become a masterpiece."

1609707319,"I just completed the game with ""Star"" ending, and I liked the game. A lot.

I started playing the game using a high-spec gaming PC, but I ended up playing the game using a passive-cooled totally-no-noise PC. I had to turn down some graphics settings, but playing the game in silent system with only game-word sounds was worth the effort.

Good things:
The graphics are among the best I have seen so far. Really good with RTX 3080, still good with GTX 1650 KalmX.
Game background is very feature-rich (since it is based on old pen-and-paper RPG with several books worth of background material).
Night City is full of details and feels ""living"".
The main plot is forced, but there are a lot of optional things to do and much to explore.

Problems

There were some bugs, but I was able to by-pass most of them. In the end there was just one mission I could not complete.

The game uses ""experience level"" system, which is a carry-over form early pen-and-paper RPGs. Using levels is usually a bad design choice since it causes other bad features, such as ""hit point inflation"", which brings up ""leveled items"" and forces constant equipment upgrading. Some other modern games, such as ""Assassin Creed - Valhalla"" managed to get rid of experience levels and turned equipment upgrading to more lore-friendly.

The game uses ""action music"" during combat. This is extremely stupid feature, and it feels like ""Ohh... a fight... let me just put on my headphones and turn up the volume so that I can't hear what enemies are doing..."". While I could go to the sound settings and turn music volume to zero, this setting affects all music in the game, including cut-scenes. The game should have separate volume controls for action music so it cold be turned off. (The only place where the use of ""action music"" is justified was in the movie ""Iron Eagle (1986)"", and even then it was a stupid feature in a B-list movie.)

There are several places in the game where I could find traces from cut content. For example, it appears that there was supposed to be a ""Saints Row 3"" -style vehicle modding feature, since you can find the non-functional modding garages around the Night City. Since there is no modding, buying vehicles is pretty much pointless. If you need a vehicle, just take one from local gangs.

Weapon modding is limited to Sight, Suppressor and chips. There is no other features such as hi-cap magazines, except the one you can see in the very first Braindance (yes, read the description when you scan the gun during BD). Having a weapon which uses normal ammunition but has weird damage types (chemical, electrical, thermal) is really odd. It would be more acceptable to load your weapon with special ammunition (for example, API with white phosphor filler), but having a weapon which turns FMJ ammunition into API during shooting is more suitable for Urban Fantasy setting with wizards and unicorns.

While there were problems, I still liked the game."
1609682258,great game with really good storytelling and fun combat. Their are some minor hiccups but most of the bugs seem to be patched out.
1609682137,Good game for early access....
1609682113,"This review is a weird one for me, I both really like it and am really bothered by it.  It took me 99 hours to beat all side story and main quests in a leisurely pace with probably like 10ish hours of just nothing but exploring in the beginning. So I definitely got my moneys worth in terms of gameplay. I feel like a large chunk of the story is in the side missions so if you don't do them then the game is quick and lame for you. 

I want to say this though about why I really am bothered by this game. The 2018 e3 gameplay video puts a damper on this game for me. That gameplay footage from 2018 is the game I wanted to play, not the one we got. I feel like 90% of the stuff they said/showed would be in this game isn't. I am super let down in this regard. 

However what we got is still really good as a game goes, it's just not what it should/could have been, and thats from the devs not from my expectations. My expectations were set by the 2018 video and they cut all of it basically. 
"
1609681979,Great Game!
1609681930,"Game Done! I am satisfied with the ending I chose.

Yeah the game was buggy, there were glitches left and right, but the story didn't disappoint. Though it was too short for my liking. This was because they just had to listen to Witcher ""fans"" who thought the Witcher 3 was too long.

Time to play another round while waiting for the DLC."
1609755626,"The game is too expensive for what it offers and the questionable overall quality.  

- constantly encountering a bug during combat : everything moving slowly and the interface gets  stuck in nethacking-mode

- another combat bug :   the movement keys  suddenly no longer working.  Unable to crouch , standing in the middle of 8 enemies. Somehow managed to shoot them while healing.  Then I had to spend a few minutes killing the last 2 of them with 'short circuit' nethacking via cameras , because otherwise they were hiding forever.  Finally managed to save  and then restarted the game.  

- so the police gives me a mission to eliminate a group of bandits .  Start fighting .  At some point the police spawns behind me and kills me for 'criminal activity'  (wtf ?!)   . 

- missing mechanics for being friendly/hostile  with different factions.  Also it would be necessary to have some mechanism for becoming ""wanted"" by police in case you do illegal things , instead of the current instant police spawn that is ridiculous and has no consequences if you manage to run away . 

- driving the car basically feels 'incontrollable' 

- character customization is useless , since the game is first-person only.  You can see yourself only in the mirror (with a horrible image quality : weird face texture and pixelated hair )  or when using the 'selfie' photos (the photo mode is obviously meant to be a cheap pathetic replacement for third-person view) .   

- full of minor flaws ,  for example the home has a clothes closet that initially containing some items. But afterwards you can't store clothes inside :    you have to put the clothes in the stash instead. 

- while loading the game ,  there is always the same radio broadcast .  It can't be such a big effort to have 10-15 different recordings and randomize them . 

- ""open world"" not great , feels so empty  . All doors are closed.  When you click on npc's  they barely say a 'hi'  or 'hey, watch out'  and continue to walk  ( just compare this against Skyrim where you can attempt to steal from anybody  , enter most  houses ... ) .  


I've played just 20 hours so far and regret the purchase.  Probably I'll continue to play the game for a little while before I move to something else that i'll find more entertaining  ."
1609681681,Great game if you have the right specs
1609681656,"so far so good, minor glitches are bearable"
1609681468,"Remember the mass effect red/green/blue ending shenanigans? Whooo boy, say what you will about cyberpunk, but the finale can play out in some unique ways.  Overall I had blast playing a ninja samurai sniper that didn't follow the main line, and ended up with a pretty miserable end, followed by  a puncher that punches everything they see, and went out in a true blaze of glory. The way those two games played out near the end were remarkably different. 

The most heartwarming of bugs (interred here in case they're patched):
-the outer traffic line in the city center ring that just violently plows through obstacles. Its a city scale garbage disposal!
-The Rock perk may make you unable to be knocked down, but it also will cause you to instantly die to traffic collisions, and few random falls from above (i think the fall down animation makes you briefly invulnerable). Equally frustrating and hilarious. Be sure to look both ways before crossing the street (I believe by the end, I'd died 37 times from cars hitting me)
-drivers standing 20 feet away from their car while driving <3

Constructive criticisms:
-I wish there was some deeper complexities to hacking and quickhacks. It never really felt like the battles were alive in that space, and i think it could have added a nice texture to the fights (ie, ICE daemons that you need to be careful of, complex chains of data points that act as defenders, etc. Felt a bit too much like magic in.
-its not always clear what the outcome of choices will be in the game (many times the option doesn't match what your character says). Could have used a context-sensitive ""aside"" box that implies what you'll do.
"
1609684201,"TL;DR: The game is great, the story is good, the characters are amazing, but the endings I got for my playthrough sucked and was very unsatisfying. I'm very sure that I didn't get ""bad"" endings because I played through the ""bad"" ending first and found that to be more satisfying that actually doing the real ending(s). Went with the supposed corpo endings btw. Despite that I still recommend the game. Just wait for these supposed big patches that will fix a lot of things to come out.

While the game didn't deliver on all of it's promises it was still a really fun experience. I experienced mostly very minor bugs (T-Posing, clipping, etc) and bugs that happened to prevent quest progress were fixed by just reloading the save. There is a bug I think though that when you complete the game you're suppose to get some special items/gear but they don't pop up for some people? I didn't see anything at all new in my inventory or stash after completing. Kinda pissed tbh. FPS was iffy at times on launch but now I'm at around 55-60fps on a 1660ti with a mix of high and med settings. 

Just to get it out of the way, life paths don't mean shit besides a couple of new dialog options that may or may not actually do anything story wise. Other than that the story was great and the side quests distracting which is to say the side quests were interesting and fun making you want to keep doing them. Doing the quest chains with/for certain npcs to get to know them was great and helps you get really attached to them. I went down the path to romance Judy for my first playthrough and her quest chain, mainly the later bits, is great with lots of emotional moments  with a satisfying conclusion. Even if you don't romance a character their quest chains are still fun to go through. Took me about 70 hours for one playthrough and that's without doing ALL of the side content. The rest of the hours were spent dicking around in character creation and trying the other life paths.

The ending of the game.. [b]this is going to be spoilers so look at your own risk.[/b]


[spoiler]I was playing a corpo character and towords the end you have options. Choose to go with Arasaka for help with the chip, choose Johnny and Rogue, go to Panam and the nomads for help, or kill yourself. I'm assuming this is what they meant by you being able to switch your life path at some point in the game? Anyway I went with the option to just blow my brains out just to see how it played out. Tbh I actually liked it. It felt like a proper ending with your character at that point on the verge of dying anyway with all the hard ships they've gone through it felt like a very real option. 

Reloading the save I went with Arasaka because corpo. You get another hour and half or so of gameplay as you work with Hanako to raid Arasaka to take back control from her brother. Felt pretty cool despite Adam fucking Smasher being easy as fuck and disappointing. Anyway you go through all this shit take down her brother and Hanako gets you set up to take the chip out. After removing the chip you're stuck on this spaceship while they monitor you. You don't know how long you've been there for but it's just the same tests over and over and over which drives you and your character to a breaking point only to find out you have irreversible brain damage pretty much and you'll die soon anyway. So you have two options/endings: They store your soul in a chip like Johnny probably never to see the light of day or you live out the rest of your time on earth. So I chose to go back to earth at first and the game ends with your character looking at earth from the spaceship and ripping off the necklace with the bullet Viktor gave you. You then get little video chats from the people closest to you wondering how you are doing and where you are. Also Judy breaks up with you... WTF? Did my character just ignore every one when they went back or something?. So I reloaded and got my mind stored on a chip and got the same fucking ending with the same video calls. At this point I would just prefer the ending with my character killing themselves to be the canon ending. What a disappointment. [/spoiler]"
1609681082,"Well yes, it is buggy. Yes, it is heavy on the performance. Yes, it has a long way to go. But man, its it still good."
1609680974,"It's definitely still not as polished as I'd expect for an AAA game costing nearly 100 AUD but I think it's definitely worth playing and will likely have the bugs ironed out as time goes on.
I realise the bugs should have been ironed out before release however I have to assume it was released ""early"" due to time or marketing constraints so I'm trying to give CDPR the benefit of the doubt."
1609680906,Love it
1609680870,Unfinished and buggy.
1609955450,"Right out of the bat. Yeah it's a buggy mess. But regardless, I love it. The city looks great. The characters are played well and the stories that come with them kept reeling me in.
I like the different ways you can develop your character. I feel like whatever your playstyle is, there is bound to be something for you.

If you're willing to look past the bugs then yes. I recommend the game. If you can't deal with those, wait for the polishing.
The game is far from perfect. But I still feel this is a potential masterpiece, and I've really enjoyed every moment."
1609680821,this game is shit dont buy it
1609680725,"reluctantly having to give this game a 2nd go. There is a glitch that stops you from continuing the game (my first attempt), and although it takes about 6 hrs of game play to get to that point, the fact that the game become useless is still not enough reason for steam to give a refund, as i had played more than 2 hrs. Further to this, Steam are still yet to give a refund. i will try again to play this game, as it was quite expensive. very unhappy with the play ability of the game, very unhappy with steam themselves."
1609680634,awesome breathtaking world
1609680604,"I have a pretty average setup, and this game is amazing. Everything about it -- combat, writing, design, atmosphere -- is top notch."
1609680496,"Great game in every way. Hope they expand the game into the future for at least a decade, I will buy all dlc/expansions. Online version and VR capabilities would be a highlight. And less restrictions. Let the players decide even more."
1609680468,"Love the game, great open world. The concept of the game is interesting, as well as the story line"
1609680428,Cyberpunk was well worth the wait! I am having so much fun with it!
1609680426,"The story carries this game hard. Similar to the Witcher series, I definitely got connected to the characters and the multiple endings are great. Overall the game plays like a mix of Fallout, Borderlands, and GTA (but not as polished). If you can play through the bugs (just think you're playing a Bethesda game), then you will for sure have fun. The game will only get better as CDPR continues to patch it. 

7.5/10"
1609680386,I like the game. The side quests does not grip me as they did in W3 but I am 32h in and have not done alot of the main quest :) To me it feels more like in W2. It was a great game but it doesn't feel like CDPR has hit their stride in this new environment yet. Over all though 85/100
1609680368,Panam big milker fat clapper big pog
1609680330,"Hands down, my Game of the Year. What a breath of fckin fresh air! All the characters are masterfully crafted with believable depth, which creates genuinely emotional moments. Action+Adventure+RPG - it hits all the sweet spots and it earns a place up there with Fallout & Elder Scrolls. Such good graphics. Such fun fights. Such a shame that people are complaining about bugs because anyone that has played open world games knows that it's fairly commonplace and that sh!t gets patched real quick ffs. 11/10 MUST PLAY."
1609682865,"Here we have the most controversial game release of 2020. I'm not even going to touch on the subject of the broken console releases, that's an incredibly sad story but my experiences are solely based on the Windows release, as is my recommendation. I've played it extensively, reached max level and have pretty much seen everything there is to see by now. I wouldn't have done that if this game was all bad. It's not. 

Cyberpunk 2077 has been hyped to death ever since it was announced back in 2013. The enormous succes of The Witcher 3 a couple of years later only added to the pressure and subsequently put the bar so high that CD Projekt RED was pretty much inevitably going to fail to meet the standard they had created for themselves. This is literally a case study in being a victim of your own succes story.  Meanwhile the hype train kept on pushing on and the fires inside of its engine were consistently lit by the company itself. The addition of Keanu Reeves as a main character went over really well, trailers were profesionally made and well received and everyone was pumped for the game's release. Something was off, however. The game kept getting pushed back and finally released in December.

I got Cyberpunk 2077 as it released and started a new campaign playthrough, which I finished all the way to the end grabbing achievements along the way and doing everything there is to do. My PC ran the game well enough, so I didn't have much of a problem with performance. This is an action/RPG hybrid in an open world setting, based on lore elements established in an old tabletop game. You play as V, a character you build up and customize at the very start of the game. You pick the looks and a life path, Nomad, Corpo or Street Kid. I made a Corpo V and at first I was really impressed by the setting, blown away in the beginning hours actually. The city seemed to breathe, and the way that characters were interacting with me and each other, just the way they talked was alien to me but yet incredibly interesting. It was all still very much human but in a different reality from our own. 

They completely nailed the Cyberpunk setting and aesthetic in the form of the game's digital playground called Night City, which can be traced back to the smallest graphical details. In fact this is graphically one of the most impressive games I have ever seen. HDR really adds something as well on an OLED screen, as the city is filled with bright colors and neon. My 2070 card sadly isn't up to snuff to play this with Ray Tracing enabled and an enjoyable frame rate, but it looks amazing from what I've seen. Just creating this city must have been an incredibly hefty job. The game's music is also on point, serving up a nice dose of adrenaline in action filled sequences and helping to create just the right tone to succesfully compliment the Cyberpunk mood. It can get a bit repetitive during battles after a while though. 

The opening missions paint a picture which is framed differently depending on the life path you've chosen. We were led to believe these would be completely different game experiences, but that's not the case. Only the game's first hours differ and you get dialogue options during your playthrough related to your chosen life path. These open up some different options of handling things or create shortcuts. Nothing more. Finding this out was, of course, very disappointing. As V your character is just trying to make it in the big city, working together with a buddy called Jackie who introduces you to all sorts of shady characters. 

The main story sets things up nicely all the way up to your typical 'job goes incredibly wrong' scenario where V's world is turned upside down. This is where Keanu Reeves' character gets introduced. Johnny Silverhand is a deceased rocker/terrorist whose entire existence somehow ended up on a chip. This chip ends up inside your head along with Johnny's personality, who becomes an unwanted tenant inside the apartment complex that makes up V's mind. This is the main plot device as V desperately tries to deal with his new found friend, whose ongoing presence will slowly but surely be fatal. It's an interesting and original story, ironically somewhat marred by Keanu Reeves who, being Keanu Reeves, leaves most emotions out of the equation in his acting.

At this point the game's open world will be completely accessible, the main storyline can be played and several side missions can be enjoyed. There's also bucket loads of so called 'gigs' per district which have V doing smaller jobs for cash. Lastly there's an incredibly hefty list of police matters on the very busy map where V can choose to intervene for some extra cash as well. This is also the part where the game starts showing all sorts of cracks and falling apart. The open world isn't alive, it's dead. NPC's roam around with no resemblance of having any AI at all, just going about their business as a bunch of zombie drones with no end goal. If you compare the interaction with NPC's here with for instance Rockstar's open worlds in the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption series this just seems archaic. One of the worst offenders when it comes to bad AI here is optional interaction with Night City police. They will just spawn on top of you and start shooting. If you run away they will hardly give chase. This is inexcusable for a game released in 2020. 

Then there's the issue of the bugs. Did I have them? Yes. Some weird stuff happened like V doing T-poses on top of my vehicle out of nowhere, characters not interacting when they should've been, missing items in the game world, flying and/or exploding cars at random...the list goes on. Did I have game breaking bugs as well? Yes, I had a couple of bugs which completely halted my progress and forced me to reload a previous game. Was anything big enough to detract from my overall enjoyment of the game? Not really. 

When Cyberpunk works it's pretty great. You have multiple ways of approaching each objective, comparable to the Deus Ex games. You can sneak kill everyone, go in guns blazing or hack every system in sight. Up to you. There's also an intricate leveling system in the form of all sorts of upgrades, crafting and several skill trees. This system never gets highlighted to you during gameplay though, so it's up to you to find out how it all works together and it can seem pretty complex at first. This can even lead to you not utilizing half the stuff the game allows you to use, which is kind of a missed opportunity. The same also goes for visiting ripper docs along the way and upgrading your core systems. You don't have to, but you'll be missing out. 

The story goes a bit downhill past the halfway mark if you don't read up on all sorts of lore items you find along the way. You will start wondering how all these characters even know V and it will feel like you missed a good chunk of everyone's back story, making you lose investment. The main storyline can be finished in about 15 hours and then there's a lot of really great side missions left to explore. These are comparable to how The Witcher 3 handled it's side content, but never get as deep as in that game. There's also a couple of fun but underutilized game mechanics like in-depth analysis in the form of brain dances. The entire second half of the game feels unfinished to me when compared to the opening hours.

Cyberpunk 2077 does get a recommend from me, because not doing so would be hypocritical. I've had lots of fun during my playthrough which lasted over a hundred hours, but my own personal expectations weren't extremely high. To be fair though, in it's current state paying full price for it is a hard sell, the game is honestly just not good enough to warrant that at the moment. If you can bring yourself to wait a couple of months until this game gets fully patched and maybe some DLC gets added which brings something more to the table, that would probably be the best option here."
1609679845,I have spent 32 of the hours I have played trying to get the game to work. I am being extremely serious when I say that this game is complete garbage. I have way above recommended and the game gives me 7 frames max on low settings. It is unplayable. Just for context I have a gtx 1650 super graphics card with 16gb of ram and an i5 processor. I would strongly not advise this game to anyone. Story and idea is pretty good but it's a shame that the game does not run.
1609679794,"The good, the bad and the ugly.

I finished this game before any of the bigger patches, it was a beautiful, hilarious and pain filled train wreck at every turn.

The story and characters in Cyberpunk are quite good, visually the game looks great with rtx on, the combat feels great and the skill offer quite a large amount of choice. 

However, I feel there are some story beats that fall slightly flat and this isn't helped by the ridiculous amount of bugs and glitches. 
I did go into Cyberpunk hoping it would be an immersive sim (my mistake admittedly), however it suffers from Fallout 4 syndrome where I felt like I was being railroaded into certain paths, and overall felt like my choices didn't really matter. 

After playing some side jobs and exploring night city after a couple of the patches I can see the devs are really trying to salvage the game. If someone had told me this was an early access game I would have believed them. (lord knows how the console players must feel)

I know this sounds rather negative, but outside of the glitches I did have a great time with Cyberpunk, I can see myself coming back when more fixes are implemented and there is some dlc content. If you can wait for a sale I'd highly suggest that, in the games current state I personally don't believe it is worth it's full price."
1609904439,"not a rpg that they were advertising it as, if you like linear games like mafia, get it. If you want a good rpg, get new vegas. 2077 is absurdly unoptimized and buggy. The story is as short as the lifespan of a baby overdosing on joy drugs, like way too short if you dont play any side quests, everything seems so out of place batman vs superman style. I'd rather not buy it, otherwise its a good game on a cheaper price."
1609679444,Why you all gotta make me feel like some kinda hipster for loving this game?
1609679368,its fun so far
1609679363,I have not had a ton of major issues. I have experienced a few bugs that made me restart the game really quick but that to me isnt a big deal. I have an average prebuilt $700 pc.
1609679334,"good game, if you can look past the glitches. it may not be what was promised but its still excellent."
1609679157,"There are lots of bugs at release yes, but there's also...

- Absolutely phenomenal worldbuilding
- Wonderful graphics and atmosphere
- Writing that is way above almost anything else
- An exceptionnally captivating storyline and quests

If you're hesitating, give them another couple of months to work out the kinks but know that this game (PC version at least) is an absolute bomb."
1609679119,"Despite the glitches here and there, the game still looks awsome.
still disappointed with the disappearing cars on the road though :)

Visually, the game is amazing, but still requires alot of work and fixes, etc.
the game is also far to easy once you max out one perk"
1609679063,"It's just not very good. The story is short, has no real choices, the world is bland and the AI is brain-dead at both combat and driving. Any vehicle or object even NEAR the road backs up traffic like it's GTA from 10 years ago. The first hour or so with Jackie is pretty solid and then it turns fully bland and flat.

The RPG mechanics are non-existent, a few stat boosts here and there and new weapons and clothes drops are much better than any crafting can give so you look like a clown for the 10 hour main story. The starting choice makes no difference at all other than a few lines here and there.

All weapons have few animations. Melee weapons have maybe 3 animations each but doing a heavy attack on any standard enemy if powered enough constantly does the exact same slash then head cut over and over. I was excited for the mantis blades but they have the same issue, the picking a guy up and killing animations every kill. People are even equipping a mod to make your weapon non-lethal as a work around.

Not even getting into the bugs that people are experiencing (I only had a few minor ones like T-posing NPCs every now and then) the game just is not worth your time. A TL:DR would be that this is No Man's Sky hype with the same lack of depth and soul and without the same level of support NMS got, people will be unbelievably weary to buy a CDPR game in the future."
1609678991,it's worth buying a PC just to play this game.
1609678960,"awesome game, even with a lot of bugs, but the worst ones have been weeded out"
1609678870,"Review based on a 118 hours full playthrough. This game is not the disaster some make it out to be, but you have to go in with the right expectations. And these misconceptions were created by CDPR themselves, it has to be said. This is not something grander in scope than GTA, but it still is a really fun open world shooter with decent rpg mechanics and some immersive sim elements to allow for different approaches to missions.

The graphics, art design, sound and music are all great in my opinion. The world is massive and beautiful, and it has a great cyberpunk feel. Neon glitter & technological glamour in a world ruled by corporations, megabuildings, but also massive poverty and exploitation of the weak. The police can't contain the violence or be of much help, so mercenaries are used instead. 
In the game you play as such a mercenary, and you get a great feel of how the world works through a lot of side content. Most side quests feature bespoke narrative and characters to interact with, and usually allow for multiple tactical approaches. All characters are voiced, well acted and well animated. The performances are hampered by regular though minor bugs and glitches, like characters moving through doors and their cigarettes still hanging in the air after they step away. 

The main story is good, though a bit short. Throughout the story you attack and undermine a megacorp that is developing tech to transfer human conscience into other vessels. You end up with such a conscience in your head, an old rocker and eventual anti-corp terrorist Johnny Silverhand, played by Keanu. A cool and unique premise that is used well throughout. He comments on your actions and pops up oftenly to comment on what's happening around you and your actions. He is very sour at the beginning, but does warm up in a believable way if you make the effort to explore his past. 
There are multiple endings, but player choice in the end is very limited when it comes to quest resolution. This is no New Vegas, with a definite lack of non-violent options and no faction system. Only the side jobs offer a decent amount of player choice, but you're sadly never really role playing in the game. NPC's always react the same to you, irrespective of whether you play an honorable vigilante or violent anarchist. Still, there are multiple side missions that allow you to influence their outcome.

The gameplay is good, with lots of options to customize your experience around a certain playstyle. I played a hacker/engineer type, and in the end truly felt like a hacker wizard. Able to annihilate groups of enemies by forcing them to commit suicide, go cyberpsycho and attack all around them, or fry their brains directly. That felt great, and so does the shooting. You can climb almost anywhere, sneak around, hack camera's, go in guns blazing. It's no Deus Ex, but it's deeper than Farcry in this respect.

All in all, this is a good game by its' own merits. It's just not an experience that raises the bar in any way apart of the visual presentation and geometric complexity of the world. The game also feels incomplete.  The open world simulation aspect, for example, falls apart immediately if you try to interact with any of its' systems. If you leave a vehicle parked in the street you'll see traffic jams there throughout the game because vehicles can't navigate. Same goes for pedestrians or the police. The story also feels incomplete, both in the buildup to the events that kick off the story, and the final big heist. And I already mentioned the constant little glitches and bugs that break the immersion. 
Still, this PC version of Cyberpunk 2077 already is a fun open world game that I can recommend to anybody that goes in with the right expectations. 7/10 right now, that can become a very good game with some patches."
1609678558,"Works great. None of the bugs are game breaking, and mostly character clipping or dialogue based. doesn't make much difference.

Really enjoying the game, though some methods of combat are kind broken, so I just avoid them. Do yourself a favour and mentally note to yourself that you are gonna play through it more than once, so you don't agonise over various choices or perks/upgrades."
1609678526,Amazing game with awesome side quest lines!
1609678475,"I had fun but yeah, it needs more time."
1609678450,"Oh boy...Cyberpunk 2077. A big letdown for many but for me? Nope. I can nitpick many problems in the game, but that would mean, that the game is bad, which it definitely isn't. This was hands down my best gaming experience in the year 2020. The story was great, the characters were amazing, the world is probably the most gorgeous game world I've ever seen. Great visuals even on older specs. The music? Oh man, the music was terrific. The gunplay? Yeah, the gunplay was a little worse, still fine tho. The driving was near awful honestly. But all in all a very fun game, that made me invest almost a hundred hours into it. 

If I were to point out my biggest issues with the game, than that would be:

1) Bugs here, bugs there, bugs everywhere. Game-breaking bugs are also unfortunately very often present. 
2) Police is useless, dumb and frustrating. They teleport behind you or better yet, materialize right in front of you 2 seconds after commiting a crime. But no worries tho, they can't use vehicles, so all you have to do is hop into a car, drive forward for a few meters and bam, no police. Just...why???
3) Car-chase missions are scripted. No matter how many times you shoot your pursuers, they still die at the same place meaning, you don't even have to shoot at all. You can just watch and wait. A very strange decision by CDPR. 
4) Dissapearing cars and NPC's ruin the immersion a lot. So does your driver ramming into cars that are standing still or driving over innocent pedestrians. It was funny at first, but seeing it happen over and over again also kills the immersion.
5) As mentioned, driving is awful.
6) You can't change how you look after you're done creating your character. You stay like this forever. In a world of cyber implants and space hotels, barber technology is somehow way too advanced.

and finally,

7) Phone calls. You have the option to pick up the phone but don't bother because the game forces you to pick it up anyways after a few seconds and you cannot hang up nor can you skip the phone calls. Again, why, just why??? Why did CDPR think this was a good idea? Worst thing is you can get these phone calls at any given moment, even when you're literally talking to someone irl during a quest. 

These were my 7 biggest issues. Other than that everything was fine and I would definitely reccomend this game to anyone. Even tho people expected a masterpiece this game was still amazing. The fact that they made up a band (Samurai) for the story with actual songs (that are imho fire) is badass. I love Johnny Silverhand's character. Most of the endings made me feel like tearing up which just shows how great it was.

A solid 8/10."
1609678030,"The game is in a playable state, and that's fine by me. I just wanted a game where I could shoot guys in a Cyberpunk setting. I got exactly what I wished for.
The bugs and glitches aren't all that game-breaking, and honestly, it's funny as hell. Sure, I'd like it all to be ironed out, but in its current state, it's playable, and I've been having fun with it."
1609677881,"Great game overall, definitely needs bug fixes and patches, but the game itself is very story rich and detailed."
1609677866,"Game is fun, but there are plently of bugs and quirky stuffs that needs fixing. Thankfully i did not encounter anything game breaking. The bugs that I encountered could be resolved by quick saving and loading the save file.

The main story is kinda short, hopefully the DLCs and future patches would address the issues."
1609677839,Still needs alot of work. Basically a incomplete mess.
1609677660,":Characters constantly :character constantly interrupting one :characters constantly interrupting :another :one another

COPs have no proper AI.

Driving is excruciating. Not enjoyable at all.

Ridiculously unoptimized graphics. 

bugs bugs bugs

Story is good. But V's (Male) voice-acting is really awkward at times. 

Anoying phone calls that cant be ignored. 

Quickhacking is fun. Mantis blades kept visually glitching out so I could not use them 

Greatly disappointed."
1609677516,9/10
1609677504,"Trash can physics exploding for no reason when you walk by.
UI getting stuck so you cannot see.
NPCs getting stuck. NPCs seeing you through solid material compromising your stealth mission.
Janky movement causing you to sidestep into a shelf now and then and just throw stuff everywhere.
A crap ton of glitches that breaks the immersion like pants going missing.
Graphics are nothing special. Without ray tracing it looks like a PS3 game.
Story is cool though (even if it's a bit cliché with the implant stuff) so it will probably be great in 6-12 months after some patches, like Witcher."
1609677130,"I don't write many reviews but I feel given the buzz around this game it needed it. 

Alright so, it's not as polished as i would have liked from CD Project Red but what makes CDRD's games is the story, and this doesn't fall short. From the voice acting to the motion capture it's brilliant and really takes in the Cyberpunk vibe. Best Mo' Cap' i've seen in a game bar none, the face movements and reactions to what you say are realistic and not awkward, delayed or well just pain weird. Every character i've liked so far and again they have their own independent realism to them to make them fit nicely into the game and I can get an emotional connection to them (unlike Mass Effect Andromeda). 

The choices and consequences of your actions are not nearly as harsh or complicated as The Witcher 3, which I prefer. Though that's my personal taste. 

There's lot's to do re side missions, gigs and NCPD activities and i'd well recommend just exploring the place as there are so many Easter eggs and loot to find off the beat and track. 

Combat is nice and the challenge around stealth/non-steal approaches etc is great as nearly all missions give you that flexibility and make you think about how you'd like to go about it. My only gripe with the combat side is that there isn't really many variants of weapons for each style (power, tech etc) and there isn't many mods for them too, which is a bit odd given there are gazillions of different styles of clothing. 

Another gripe are cars, they are just a bit poo really and don't feel like they belong in the city plus they are quite clunky to drive. Well that's until you can get to the cars in the badlands which are a whole new world compared to the ones you get in the city. The Galena ""Geko"" is cheap, fast and fun as hell - totally recommend it. 

Yeah so there's some bugs, but i've not had a single game breaking or fun dampening one (yet) and if you compare this to basically any say, Bethesda, game at launch (or even several years after for that matter), you can't really complain. I feel as if there is a very unnecessary hype around there being ""so many bugs"", but like I said, compare that to may other big corp studios it's nothing above average in my opinion. Could there have been less? Yeah for sure, but I'll give them props for admitting they will be there. I'd like to see Bethesda or Ubi do the same...  

Would i recommend it? With out a doubt. 
Is it worth waiting for Bug fixes? Not really, but that's your preference. 
Most importantly, do i trust CDPR to fix the issues? Absolutely.

1609677120,"Good game that is a blend of grand theft auto, deus ex, watch dogs, and assasins creedi. Will keep a player busy for multiple nights and then some."
1609677099,"Despite its bugs and flaws I have to say this game is a buy. It's not the best story, combat and so on, but it is still a very good and enjoyable game you can put plenty of hours into. Here's to hoping they will make this game even better with upcoming patches and community feedback!"

YES their is alot missing from this game. Customize your character, cars, weapons, apartment, and cyber mods are just a few. YES omg are their bugs and glitches. YES those bugs/glitches have made me reload the game countless times and i am currently full of items in my inventory that i cannot store, sell, or dismantle. Yes the game can feel extremely slow reliving some cutscenes and discussions, im looking at the slow moving Takemuro. 

However with all that said. the game was extremely fun. the story was fantastic. the different endings were wildly different from one to the other. hidden easter eggs were fun to see. the load screen was great that it evolved with you. cant wait for DLC (hopefully some free updates to fix what was mentioned above)"

1609676036,"I don't mean to sound like a hater, but it just doesn't feel open world to me.  Full disclosure, this is the first CD Projekt Red game I have played. I haven't put 100 hours int like many people, I went to youtube to see what the endings were and couldn't help but feel it was just a story on rails, which is fine for a movie, or a book. However, a video game is something different to me. I'm not sure how meaningful the actual mechanics are. I spec'd out a stealthy hacker, but found I could just go toe to toe and slug it out fist if I wanted, or go guns blazing. That was kind of nice, I could just play how I wanted, given the situation. I guess what was disappointing was city in general. While it is busy, it felt soulless, empty, nothing behind the people. While that's common, examples are GTA online, skyrim, etc. It seems CD Projekt Red promised something bigger than more of the same (with a fresh coat of paint)."

1609674806,"Great game. Despite all of the rough start and bugs that a lot of people encounter, I had a very great time enjoying this game. I do not experience any bugs or crashes, just some glitches that easily fixed with a simple load. Looking forward for the DLCs, kudos for the devs for their hardwork."
1609674703,not buggy
1609674643,"Even though I have experienced some bugs and i admit they really missed some opportunities to get more out of gangs and other factions, the gameplay is fun, the world is beautifull and the skills are interesting.
I hope they will futher improve on this uncut gem of a game. If you like the gerne, get it, it's worthwile..."
1609674614,Awesome and immersive game. A few Glitches here and there but not too much of a bother for a game released prematurely... but late. I am sure patches will be released IOT fix those bugs. Stay away from console version until everything is fixed and re-released.

It has a lot of glitches and bugs."

1609673655,While extremely buggy the story line and replayability are great. So much to do in Night City
1609673591,"It's not the second coming of Christ that some people hyped it up as prior to release. I certainly had my hopes up but I can't say I'm surprised at the amount of bugs and issues that currently plague the game. That being said, when it works, it's stunning to look at and the combat can be pretty satisfying at higher levels. The story kept me invested, the music was memorable, and overall presentation can't be denied. I put 70 hours in, I'm overall pretty satisfied with it.

There's serious potential here if CDPR manages to update, clean up, and add too what's already here. It'll be interesting to see what this game looks like a year from now. Still, if you're at all interested, I'd give it a shot. Especially if you have a high end PC.

It's a shame this game didn't live up to its potential on release though. No popular gaming company is immune to the pressures of corporate greed (fitting for the game's themes), CDPR seemed like they might've been immune to such pressures, but apparently not. Money needs to shut the fuck up for a while and let devs finish what they start. 

9/10."

- Too long dialogues that give minimum info
- Non-existent AI

1609672458,"i like it. the only problem come when you try to aim when using a controller (PS4) as doing so will make the scanner activate and that makes it so you can't shoot. so the only thing i use my controller for is the driving.

1609672291,"If you dislike anything that is buggy I suggest not buying this until they really fix the game, if you don't mind reloading a save file to get the game working again, then I do say the side stories and main story is really heartwarming, heartbreaking and really is great.

It's not as in depth as it was hyped over the years, but the story is nonetheless pretty good.
The rest of the open world is pretty shallow and again... buggy"
1609671797,boobie
1609671744,"I will start with commenting that I am not an avid gamer nor am I an enthusiast of games. I just got into RPG games because I have free time on my hands during COVID. It was only after playing the game that I realise how much hype was there about the game and how long people have been waiting for this. 

Coming from an amateur, the game is certainly immersive and fun, I spent about 100 hours and leveled up to the point where my sniper rifle can basically blast through walls and concrete from miles away. Some might call it cheating, but hey, I had fun ping-ing and blasting away. I know that there are limitations to the game that people are not expecting, and at some point I do feel that the entire game was a re-skin of Outer Worlds which I thoroughly enjoyed as well (even the weapons menu and crafting menu looks the same), but I guess I am the kind of player who enjoys the story rather than action, and just going around with different characters and missions made my time spent on the game really enjoyable. 

It's not a popular opinion by any means, and it's not without its bugs (most annoying is not being able to throw a grenade without re-starting the game), but I would recommend for people to try this game out, not because of the hype, but because of the graphical elements and storyline!"
1609671676,"The Good , The Bad , The Dirty ...

The Good ,..  Story's Some of the game play is good but missing like 40% of foundation work . 
The Bad ...,  Well 3 things FPS Quality limiter  as in u give up to much fps for gfx ,  Ai feels off or broken,  and  The bugs are game breaking  bugs ,   and now also many Crashes , 
The Dirty.... no game should ever go out untill its at least 90% done  so why are you giving DLC  when game is at least 2 years out before core game play can finish and be fixed aat 100%    

Now Truth it can be great but give the game 1 to 2 years before buying   sadly

Then i find out; this doesnt respec your attributes only skill points... so now i have to start a whole new game if i want do a different build. ALSO DO NOT sell or disassamble any unique items as youll never be able to get them back EVER AGAIN. Crafting, buying or looting. Cmon CDPROJEKT RED this is the final straw"
1609671409,"The bugs and performance issues are overhyped, like the game ironically. The story is engaging, the graphics are gorgeous, and the city is packed with side quests, events, hidden locations. Would easily recommend"
1609671404,"It's buggy, sure, but it's fun!"
1609671129,"I think I have put enough time to finally share my two cents on whether you should play this game right now or wait for the big patches.

As of 1.06:

- Performance 4/10 (Poorly optimised, not even a NASA rig could run this 100% smoothly)

- Graphics 9/10 (Given you have the PC to run this on Ultra + RT you'll absolutely love it)

- Story 9/10 (Despite the fact they obviously cut some parts of it out to the point some dialogs make no sense, it is still a very compelling story and probably the main and reason I have played so many hours. Lifepaths only affect your prologue, they don't change anything other than a few dialogs throughout the story which sucks)

- Side Content 5/10 (Not a lot of it and lacks diversity)

- AI 3/10 (Terrible, pedestrians feel extremely lifeless, cops are memes)

- Map 8/10 (You can tell which parts of the map they put the most work and which parts they just straight up rushed through, still, a gorgeous map to explore)

- Visual Customization 3/10 (Character creation screen all you get, cant customise ANYTHING else other than the armor you're wearing beyond that)

- Gear Customization 4/10 (Saying its limited is an overstatement, you basically always use the same mods for every piece)

- Character Skills 6/10 (While they give you a good amount of builds to pick from only a couple are actually worth going for)

- Difficulty 4/10 (Very Easy, Easy, and Normal. If you're looking for anything remotely close to a challenge run around naked with a katana)


All-in-all I wouldn't recommend playing this game right now, while the story can be really entertaining everything else is not. Give it half a year, and even then it will still not be the game we all expected."
1609671025,"If you don't have an RTX card, don't bother."
1609671023,While the game is riddled with bugs that make you frustrated and laugh. They can be easily overlooked by the amazing visuals and great story. If you're a fan of the cyberpunk genre and equipped with a decent computer i highly recommend you play the best game of 2020.
1609670964,"Needs some more debugging, but it's a really amazing and wonderful game."
1609670930,"After 39 hours play, I think I can safely say this is one of the most enjoyable games I've played in many years. Yes there are a few bugs, but it's so good, I can look past these for now.

Runs at 90 frames on Ultra at 3440 x 1440 on my PC with Asus 2080ti. Ray Tracing as usual just isn't worth the FPS hit though at the moment. You just don't notice it when playing.

Really looking forward to how the game progresses with major patches and DLC. I still have many more hours to go. Definitely worth a purchase if you have the PC for it."
1609670633,I mean yes this game can't run at all on older consoles like Xbox or PS4 or really consoles at all but here's the pc take on this. It has a massive story line with I believe 7 different endings and 2 secret ones. The amount of weapon choices you get in this game is pretty vast and reminds me of a borderlands or Assassins creed odyssey type weapon system. Yeah there's a few bugs here and there but honestly it's a pretty good game. Not as bad as some people are saying but not as good as CD Projekt Red hyped it up to be.  People treated the release of this game like some kind of revolutionary development in video games and thought it could cure cancer or get someone them a girlfriend. I would give it a 80% on the moist meter.
1609670466,"OK here is the thing, they built up a lot of expectations and hype and they delivered only 25% of it, sure they are fixing issues with each update but that wasn't the plan the game delayed multiple times, and they even said ""the game will be released when it's ready"" all those delays and all these years and what, that's it! really! its like when u open the bag of chips u ll only see 1/3rd portion of the bag filled with chips which tastes just ""meh!"" and rest filled with air. I have played it for hours i'd say i enjoyed that 25% they delivered but i m still annoyed by the fact that 75% is still missing. 5/10."

1609669552,"Really enjoyed the game. It's nice to see old board games brought into the game world online. All the work done by talented people was worth the wait.  Good Job, I wonder if VR will work?"
1609669636,"[h1][b]Bottom Line Up Front:[/b][/h1]  [b]Cyberpunk 2077[/b] (CP2077) has been the center of controversy since its release due to its high technical demands, inability for [b]Sony's Playstation 4[/b] (PS4) to run the game, and underwhelming experience.  Fans were under the impression there would be limitless possibilities on par with [b][url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_V]Grand Theft Auto V[/url][/b] (GTAV) despite the large focus of gameplay being an RPG and story driven game.  Although it doesn't deliver to the same caliber [b]CD Projekt Red's[/b] (CDPR) previous title did ([b][url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_3:_Wild_Hunt]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[/url][/b]).  

[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]
+ Diversity of Gameplay
+ Atmosphere
+ Simplicity and depth (for an RPG standard)
+ Diversity in story telling (also a lot of diversity in terms of skin color, gender, etc)

[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]
- Side Quests 
- Vehicle physics
- Glitches (In 101 invested hours, only encountered 2 that were game breaking)
- Optimization (Technical demand is very high.  My specs are Ryzen 5 3600X CPU with Radeon RX 5600 6GB and 16GB RAM and I average 42FPS on low settings).  

[b]Closing thoughts:[/b]
[b]CDPR[/b] has delivered an unforgettable experience.  Largely due to the fact that the game isn't as bad as the reception it's receiving.  To put the ""unplayable glitches/bugs"": the glitches are annoying but a lot of the glitches I was witnessing were corrected by patch 1.05 (current build is 1.06; a new patch comes out about once a week).  Updating drivers fixed the game breaking bugs I was experiencing.  The largest issue is the game lacks the heart [b]The Witcher 3[/b] had.  [b]CP2077[/b] has heart, but it's not fully there.  However for an Cyberpunk/Blade Runner fan who's looking for the ultimate experience, you can't look any further.  It delivers with gameplay, you can stealth or go guns blazing, you can hack and slash, quickhack, or gun fu your way through hostile encounters.  The only boring moments I had while playing was doing the number of side quests, which felt like [b]World of Warcraft[/b] fetch quests more than they felt like short stories like they did in [b]The Witcher 3[/b].  


[b][u]Grading scale: [/u][/b]
5 or below: Don't bother buying
6: Below average
7: Average
8: Above Average
9: Great/amazing game
10: Perfection or near to it, an instant classic

[b]Authors Note:[/b]  
[i]Stop saying this game sucks.  It literally doesn't.  You either like it or you don't.  A lot of people love [b]Among Us[/b] and [b]Call of Duty: Modern Warfare: Warzone: Black Ops: Cold War[/b] but I can't stand those games, it doesn't mean it sucks, I just don't enjoy them.  If you want to have a civil conversation about my review I'm down, but I'm not going to waste our time arguing about why this game isn't on par with [b]GTAV[/b].  Plus it's a little unfair to compare the two.  [b]Rockstar Games[/b] has been building an empire for decades while CDPR has been improving [b]The Witcher[/b] series.  CDPR began development of CP2077 in 2012, but their focus was on The Witcher 3 until its release in 2015, then they promised the fans solid DLC, DLC that is far superior to the markets typical DLC.  So technically, CP2077 has only been receiving the love and attention it needed for 3 years of development.  The developers were 'crunching' (definition = developers work 12+ hours 6 days a week) throughout 2019-2020.  They promised an ambitious, title, they delivered, there isn't another game on the market to this scale with the story telling this game has.  The game was overhyped because of the careless hopes and dreams of gamers when the technology isn't far off, but it's not here right now.  

However!  If you are experiencing game breaking bugs and glitches I think your opinion for saying the game sucks is justified... just don't waste your time in my comments.  My suggestion is just get a refund or wait for the next few patches.  Trust me, I was there too until I found a solution; I was pissed the game was unplayable for me in my first hour.  But I've noticed performance improvements in micro-patches.[/i]"
1609669284,"I've played this game for almost 26 hours now and I absolutely love it!

The gameplay itself is pretty good, the story is great so far and the graphics with my RTX 2070 Super are astonishing.

I see and heard a ton of people critizing the bugs / glitches and saying the game is unplayable in this state.
But for the 26 hours i've played it's nothing worse than the glitches I encountered with other games from dev's like Ubisoft.

The bugs / glitches i encountered so far:
-While standing in an elevator A.I. tends to rag doll. (occured once in story mode)
-People or vehicles floating in mid-air. (occured twice outside the city)
-Falling through the map when entering a vehicles (occured only once)
-People walking through doors. (very common)
-Random spawning of A.I. (common)
-Frozen character couldn't shoot or drive vehicles (occured once)
-Not able to pick up loot. (occured once)

All these bugs or glitches we're simply solved by going back to the main menu and then load the game again.

Conclusion:
What do you expect from a game everyone was hyping about and wanting an early release?
With almost every game that just has been launched there bugs and glitches that needs to be fixed so give the dev's some time.

In my opinion GTA 5 Online (on PS3), Far cry 3, 4 and Assassins creed unity (on PC) were worse when they just had been released. 

BTW who doesn't love a game with keanu reeves?"
1609669085,"This game has had a lot of negative publicity (fairly)  but, if you have a system (DLSS capable) that can actually play the game at reasonable frame rates it's truly special. For sure there  are some goofy bugs but, nothing I've found has been game breaking. Hopefully, they will continue to polish the game and make it more playable with more modest hardware. Too bad the days of game demos has past. If you have less than a RTX 2080 I would probably wait to see if they do some significant optimization work but, If you have a high end system with a new 30 series RTX card the game is must play."
1609669028,"All and all, with (still) many bugs, the game is amazing. The bugs more than make you smile than frustrate you for sure! The storyline may feel a little short, and of course, you will find yourself thinking how you would do it more extensive, but the ton of extra content to explore and do around NC is overwhelming. i.e. i chose not so speak to the fixers and roam around and tackle all the questions mark jobs randomly.

Great graphics, not that ""unplayable in last gen GPUs"" at all!. Gameplay at 50 to 60 FPS and 1440p is doable with a RX5700 XT in medium details.

Overall - Pretty fun game well worth the entertainment it provides for the money!
"
1609669025,"Easy 9/10 despite its technical hiccups.
Fuck the corpo!"
1609669019,Simply good story and game play.
1609669733,"I know it has bugs, I know it's not optimized well but I love this game."
1609668733,bad
1609668501,cool
1609668486,Loving the the story so far.
1609668473,"“I’ve seen things you people wouldn’t believe, Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain."""
1609668356,"This game has a lot of bugs that are mostly animation, not too game breaking but pretty annoying. The frame rate is also pretty awful. I have an RTX 2080 and I get 30-80 frames depending on where I am at max settings at 1080p. 
The story makes up for it though, oh my god the story is freaking incredible. Even side missions are fun and usually those are never fun in games
Story: 10/10
Gameplay: 6-7.5/10"
1609668354,Did you like Deus Ex: Human Revolution & Mankind Divided? I thought those were pretty good. This is like that.
1609668314,"The story is great and it was a very enjoyable game.
There are quite a few graphical glitches, however, I only had a couple of bugs that required me to reload a save."
1609668134,"A good mix of RPG and Shooter. Everytime it starts to get dull, the game surprises you with something new."
1609667932,"Rich story with excellent graphics and voice acting. Huge world with multiple paths to choose from and layers of customization for characters, skills, equipment and looks. Night City is a living thing and totally breathtaking. A few clipping issues only real bugs on my PC. Immersive and entertaining."
1609667901,"Buggy start aside, holy crap is this game good! Lets take a minute to understand just how many complicated things are actually happening in this game at one time, since we are all PC owners (I'm hoping) we can all appreciate just how massive this game is both graphically and technologically. Clearly CDPR made a few mistakes but lets face it, it was probably due to investors crying like little girls to just release the game, now they want to sue CDPR, not cool choom.

Anyway, if you're sitting on the fence about getting this game, just do it, it's amazing in every way. Story is rich, sounds are on point and the graphics are jaw dropping. game play is solid, with the only real down side probably relating to vehicle control but you quickly work that out. I wrote this at 34 hours, haven't even done a great deal of the main story, side quests and exploring are just THAT GOOD!!!! 
There are some things that don't seem to carry weight like conversation choices and the fact that V can have a mad big dong but not one single girl you hook up with complements you on the size of your crutch rocket, I know if I was a chick and some gangsta dropped a 10 pound rod on the desk I'd be like ""Damn son"" But whateves.
All in all, definitely stop listening to ANY and ALL media BS in regards to why this game fails and just buy it because it definitely does not fail."
1609808260,"A Gordian knot of spaghetti code cooked al dente with character meatballs (now with 10% synth-beef) served on a plate of vegan forgone-conclusion. 

People complain that the bugs make the game unplayable. But for me the glitchware worked almost like some kind of meta-roleplaying feature. Not since the Stanely Parable have I been so unsure if I am playing a game ""correctly."" CDPR got me to question my reality, and that is like some Laughing Man territory...so kudos. With the quick-saves and auto-saves being fairly forgiving, I found that any difficulties imposed by softlocks, or general quest flags/progression !^&#ery, to be easily navigated with simple trial and error.

The most scathing criticism I have is that the bugs outshine even the story. Every choice was nothing more than a chance to do exposition on Night City, or to change your emotion for flavor. These options rarely ever changed anything drastically enough to be considered a different ""path"". By the end of the main arc, you'll note that nothing you did up until the final encounter really mattered towards your last 3 or 4 options in the endgame. Also, to drive this point further, once you complete the conclusion you will even be returned to the autosave right before the last segment is triggered so you can see all of the options anyways. The choices for this last segment all tease you mercilessly with the pure futility of V's situation. Despite all of the yummy flavor-texts you are afforded in this last (or any) segment, youre still left with the final aftertaste of artificiality at the end of each. 

Did I enjoy it? Sure. For what it was. Cyberpunk is my favorite subgenre in books, movies, any media really... But let's not kid ourselves 'Witcher 3: Combat Evolved' - this is not.

As we know that the story is probably not going to change in any updates or overhauls. It is hard to recommend this game then, as I feel like each bug fix takes us further away from the morbid curiosity that is playing the game as it was released. For the masochist only this game is a straight 7 out of 10."
1609667853,"I haven't had any game-breaking bugs, maybe I'm just lucky?"
1609667846,"You can read any number of reviews talking about how the game doesn't work right, is riddled with bugs, and all the other technical issues it struggles with.

What I want to write about is the content that makes Cyberpunk 100% worth playing for any RPG fan. The narrative of Cyberpunk is really wonderfully written. It isn't some great critique on capitalism versus communism or a den of hedonism for players to lose themselves in, but a rather humbling tale about the importance of focusing on the little things in life.

The pursuit of wealth and fame are what ruins the main character, while everything that brings them joy is their friends, family, and neighbors- along with some spirituality in well-written side quests. Cyberpunk offers a vast world that is overwhelming to the senses to take in, but all of the most memorable moments are when Night City is silent and out of mind letting the player focus on the details of what's in front of them. If you've got a decent PC, pick it up. If you're wary about the performance, give them a few months for optimization.

Cyberpunk 2077 isn't what it was hyped up to be, and it doesn't need to be to be worth your time."
1609667765,"As a big fan of RPGs, these are my thoughts.

Story - the main quests are engaging and memorable, but Act 1 felt short, and the weird montage near the beginning felt like cut content. What should have been an emotional moment near the end of Act 1 is less impactful because you barely had time to interact with the characters. Nevertheless, I look forward to future expansions with the same quality as the Witcher 3's Hearts of Stone/Blood and Wine expansions.

Quests are a mixed bag - there are many memorable characters with great side quests (Judy, Panam, Johnny, The Hunt, and Sinnerman quests are fantastic), but also several characters and side quests that feel incomplete (Fixers, Meredith, Peralezes, Lizzie Wizzie, and Us Cracks quests feel incomplete). The gigs and NCPD hustles are considerably lower quality, and feel more like the typical open world filler content. There is also a notable lack of consequences in your actions throughout. There are also very few moments where your actions/dialogue choices have consequences, something that the Witcher 3 did better.

Gameplay mechanics are decent - gunplay feels fine and melee combat is okay, while unarmed fighting is bad (the terrible boxing quests highlight the flaws in the system), while hacking is overpowered but fun. Driving felt fine. Crafting feels unbalanced, and cyberware feels like a missed opportunity to expand the game's mechanics (Apart from the leg cyberware, everything else is basically just stat upgrades for combat). There are also several interesting features that feel underutilized, such as braindances, joytoys, street vendors, car and character customization (Why are there no barbers/plastic surgeons or car customization?). I hope these will be expanded on in the future. 

Presentation - the city is jaw-droppingly beautiful (especially with Raytracing enabled), and this is definitely one of the most graphically impressive games to date. The main story felt extremely cinematic, with realistic animations and a masterful soundtrack that heightened the emotion of key scenes. There are some bugs, but they are mostly minor visual stuff that happen infrequently (T-posing while bike riding, NPCs T-posing, cigarettes/clipboards stuck in mid-air) and did not greatly affect my enjoyment of the game.

Overall, this game feels like an 8.5/10. I enjoyed my time with the game, and eagerly look forward to revisiting the game in the future, after some DLC and expansions arrive."
1609667742,"9/10

A Little buggy, I don't know what was promised so i cant comment or missing content. But the game seems every enjoyable to me, Interesting skill system, I will be looking for more content updates.

Might give the game a break for a bit, the ending I got was not what I was expecting. I might try to replay for the different endings at some point."
1609667739,I like this swamp of pixels
1609667573,Engaging from beginning to end.  Incredible story.
1609667494,"Playing from release date to currently hotfix 1.06.  It has the scope and depth of the Bethesda games I loved like Fallout 3 and Skyrim, but with far fewer bugs than either of those titles.   The optional reading material and background TV/radio news stories help the feel of the game.  The Radio channels are worth 1/4 the cost by themselves, though being able to turn the radio volume up would be nice (there's  a separate setting for radio and ""music"" but you can't turn down ambient and leave radio up, they just both drop.  I've done one full playthrough using only non-lethal methods to complete the quests.  I only ran into two that forced me to actually kill an opponent.   Next run will be using whatever is at hand, lethal or not.  There are still a few development choices I/d like to see changed (police game mechanic is awful but also not highly relevant most of the time), but overall it's highly enjoyable.  Old school gamers will enjoy the fact that there are additional unmarked quests in the game.  You have to figure them out using your own brain and your own knowledge/memory of Night City.  These won't keep you from getting any achievements or keep you from finishing the game if you don't decide to investigate them, but have cool vehicles, guns or cyberware if you do.  It's another throwback to the 80s in a game filled with throwbacks to the 80s: A few quests like the game ""King's Quest"" that gave you an environment to explore but no quest markers.

Positives:  Multiple endings depending on in-game choices, well developed world theme, excellent graphics,  radio stations in multiple music genres, multiple fighting styles (fists, melee blades/blunt, pistols, rifles, shotguns, SMGs, cyberware enhancements, netrunner cyberware) each with enjoyable play, ability to play stealthy or combat and within each of those styles as lethal or non-lethal, large city map with street names (possible to navigate without using the dotted line guidance after some fair amount of in-game driving).  Story deals with very mature subject matter as the backstory for quests.  Stays true to the feel of the source material (William Gibson's book ""Neuromancer"", Ridley Scott's film ""Blade Runner"" and Mike Pondsmith's ""Cyberpunk"" game series among others.)  One of the more interesting ideas explored in the game is corporate-owned cyberware installed in employees as part of the job requirement and the logical consequences that come with it.

Negatives;  Game often crashes rather than exiting when clicking ""exit game"".  Enemies tend to T-pose often when hit by status effects, V sometimes T-poses while driving, Still a couple of buggy issues with some side quests given by El Capitain, but they don't stop any achievements and are irrelevant to main quest progression.  Police/crime mechanics as they relate tot he player are nonsensical:  If they attack you (which they sometimes do if you walk too close to them) you can't fight back without spawning legions of police and drones and cyberware just straight up doesn't work on them (so you can't use that set of non-lethal tools), but if you hop on a bike and travel about 2 blocks, they forget you ever existed.

And yes, I realize that trying to Batman your way through a futuristic FPS RPG using non-lethal takedowns is not high on the list of things for most people, but it does have the RPG element and the ability to choose different backstories.  I enjoyed being able to decide on a character concept and stick with it through most of the game.

Played on a PC with an ASRock mainboard, Intel i9 9900k processor not overclocked, 32GB RAM and an NVidia !080Ti graphics card with game settings on 1440 resolution, Ultra."
1609667472,Amazing game on PC. Was it all that was advertised? No. Is it still a great game? Yes!
1609667463,"I'll tell you this fair and square - the game is worth your money.

Why? well, despite all the constant complaints that the game is buggy as all hell or unfinished, what really mattered in my eyes was the playing experience and story. and OH BOY does the game deliver that IN SPADES! amazing characters that make the game feel alive, diverse storyline with choices that matter and a skilltree (that despite having one of it's attributes missing) that felt complete and creative enough that you can make whatever you want with it.

of course, every game has its flaws - cyberpunk 2077 is no exception lemme list those that bugged me :

* The Bugs - obviously it's an issue, i'd be stupid or a fanatic to ignore theme completely, do they make the game insufferable? no. there is no game on earth that doesn't have one, in the history of video game in general - there are game that still live BECAUSE they are buggy as all hell (yeah Skate, i'm looking at you). it's the dev's responsibility to fix theme as soon as possible but i wouldn't go as far as to say they must make a zero bugs game, it simply does not exist with a game as big as this.

*Missing Features - i would like to believe CDPR are holding off some features that would be more interactive with the players in future expansions of the game, regardless i would like to see the trains, the missing attribute and whatever else didn't make it into the game - eventually. I could live without knowing that the game should have had those features, really, but if you make a promise for a complete game that will lead the gaming industry to a better way by example, please CDPR, don't go on your promise, you are one of those companies I and many others look up to in these times where no other company would pick up their sh!t.

*Expansions - wishful thinking from here downward, but important ones. lemme explain, without to much spoilers, almost all endings leave the player with a somewhat open ending and a chance for V/Johnny to do something with their lives and current worsening condition, i would like to have expansions that, depending on the ending you chose, will have different player experience and story. even if we all start from only the best ending (for a lack of a better spoiler free name - the nomad ending). lemme feel that we didn't leave V to fend for himself and maybe give him the Blood And Wine ending he/she deserves. also expand and return to other characters that we all would like to know more of - Alt and the blackwall (or what's beyond it), Takemura (despite what goes on in the endings you chose, i feel like it won't be over with him and i would rather settle the terms between us), Panam, Judy, Kerry, Halt, Us Cracks - the list goes on.

*parkour - Really? heck yeah! for some reason i feel like this game has a HUGE untapped potential in parkour and fighting on rooftops and such. there are many rooftops i got to that where just deserted, then out of nowhere i find some that had a hidden locker with legendary goodies in it - so SOMEONE at the studio had the same idea as me, and that's good! that means there is still a lot the game as to offer and a lot where it can expand to.

that concludes my review of the game - enjoy!"
1609667453,I'll play again when it exits early access.
1609667380,Lit !!
1609667372,"I was one of the lucky ones that had minimal issues playing the game. It was a good story but fell a little short when comparing it to the Witcher 3. Still I enjoyed playing the game and would recommend it to others.
I also see a lot of potential for some good DLC's and look forward to playing them as well."
1609667327,"fun game, somewhat problematic bugs"
1609667313,"I will start on the positives
-Interesting world
-Interesting Characters
-Graphics look amazing (depending on hardware)
-lots of customization
 
Now the negatives
-Large portion of the game is spent on boring side quests
-most of the endings feel pointless
-Story does not know where to capitalize on moments
-performance is very poor in almost all gun fights (gtx 1080) (1920: 1080)
-Story lacks a meaningful purpose other than mostly for yourself
-Many bugs (will probably get fixed in future updates)
-No clear game play loop to follow or to get hooked on
-PS2 AI
-Roads either cluttered or empty, makes for wonky driving moments
And many other things just cant list them all here
"
1609667118,"despite what people says, despite the bugs and the technical dificulties, the braindances missions and the game forcing you  to play the main story to a point untill the map realy opens up and truly become ""open world""....   Cyberpunk is still one of the best shooting rpg game coming out at the moment. and i still would recommand it.    oh and just one thing..focus heavily on crafting ok? wether your a street samurai or a terminator you'll have more than enough perk points to allow it lol"
1609666987,"fun game, way too buggy to be released in this state, not worth the 60 bucks, i encountered a game breaking bug where i was not able to continue the main story line and am still not able to complete the main story. waiting for an update to fix this. DO NOT BUY UNTIL BUGS ARE PATCHED."
1609666723,"We get to ride a roller coaster with Keanu Reaves. Gameplay and story is amazing. Remember to do all side quest because the main quest is quiet short compared to witcher 3. 

"
1609666714,i like it :)
1609750277,"It's a good game for what it is, but it constantly breaks the immersion with bugs, characters flickering around, AI freezing or disappearing. Some of the bigger boss fights; which start of really cool, ended up with them getting stuck and me just stabbing them to death... I wouldn't recommend it in its current state. Wait for a few updates and keep your eyes on the reviews."
1609666533,"The more i look into this game the more disappointed I become.

"
1609666528,"The best game released in 2020. And I really mean it. One of the greatest game I've played so far.

This game got so many bad reviews, and pretty much of them contains critique about technical issues. bugs and bad optimization. But, despite all of that this game is pure masterpiece, this a piece of art. The Night City is soo detailed, that I was really impressed by it, this city brings you a cyberpunk atmosphere by it's best. It's not just couple of buildings, roads and etc. It's huge and beautifully designed streets with big ass amount of objects, polygons, props, graffities and etc. City doesn't seems empty, its full of stuff you want to explore more and more. 

I really appreciate the huge amount of work, which was done on designing this game, not only the world, but also characters, dialogues, in-game art like posters, ads and stuff. All of this brings such an amazing atmosphere, you feel it, you want to touch it, you want to play much more and more. Level design is good as well, and lets please keep in mind, that this is a unique style. This is Cyberpunk, not another free-world modern game. 

And music... damn, honestly one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. I could even say this is the best soundtrack ever! A huge huge appreciation from me goes to P.T. Adamczyk, an amazing work! Honestly, tracks like ""The Heist"" and ""The Rebel Path"" are on repeat everyday in my playlists. The soundtrack, while battles and shooting are awesome as well. I dont play with stealth and hacking style, I always rushing and shooting, bcuz it brings such a good emotions. It's truly satisfying to play in rush style, with this music and this good shooting system.

The shooting is really great. Somewhy it brings me COD: Black Ops 3 vibes, but its even better. Shooting is real smth in this game. You get a dose of satisfaction, when you kill someone. 

Anyway to finish this review I want to say that, despite the fact that so much stuff and many feature was cut from the game, I still enjoy and noticing pretty much little details and huge amount of work on this game. It was worth it to wait for 7 years. And please don't be mad on CD Project RED, they did a really good job. Even tho we didn't get what we expected, we still get a great game, and you can disagree with me, but  I can say, that this game seems like 7 years of developing, and this game is freaking great :3"
1609666401,"I went into this intentionally knowing as little as possible beyond the broad strokes of the setting. My experience was overall better than with the majority of open world rpgs I've played. Great voice acting, great graphics, good story, fun mechanics. Continue with an understanding that my criticisms come from a place of endearment. 

Over the three hundred hours of playing I had 4 instances where I had to reload to my last save because of bugs, nothing big but usually happened for me where dialogue transitioned to a time skip. Had one where every npc became invincible. All easily resolved with reload. After the first patch a number of my initial settings reverted to defaults, some without a way of changing it back without starting over. Again nothing real bad, just a nuisance. Not crying about it, just being upfront.

I enjoyed exploring the city; the game rewards you for exploring with some interesting side quests and a bunch of fixer and helping law enforcement POI. I think where its weak is that there are a lot of nooks and crannies you can get into and the game really doesn't reward going off the beaten path in that way. If you want a game that does that, just don't, the game can end up feeling emptier for it.

The game has a lot of neat mechanics, that no doubt required a load of developer time to refine, but some of them really aren't used as much you'd expect. Between that, the accessible but off the beaten path areas of the map, and the layout and context of certain POI, you really feel that content was cut and that despite the vastness of what you get its really feels like the minimally viable version of the game.

Through story quests you get places to live but it really didn't seem to mean much if anything for the game.  You can't keep stuff there, you can't really even sleep in some. There are mechanics' garages all over the map and at a number of points the dialogue mentions putting weapons on your vehicle; between that and the way different vehicles feel driving I really get the feeling they intended to include some absent vehicle customization. The fact your main residence has a parking garage, I kinda expected to see my vehicles show up there so I could see them all in one place, but no. 

Once I got some of the jumping and time dilation cyberware options, that's when I really had fun with the combat. My opinion, they are such standout shifts in how you approach the game they either expect everyone to play this part of the game the same way or they intended to have a greater variety of these kinds of distinctive abilities.

I enjoyed the story, but of all the side quests, particularly the main four, only two really have any impact on the options of the main story, which can leave you feeling like almost everything is inconsequential. Its a good story, but its less about branching and more just a walk around a lake with a 2 to 6 way fork at the end."
1609666438,"I honestly regret buying this game, I should of waited a couple of years until it was on sale :)
Don't get me wrong, the graphics and story is astronomical 10/10. I love it.

After finishing the main story, and doing a majority of the side missions. The game got boring pretty quickly. 
They could of added so much more features to the game, especially in free mode :/

I wouldn't recommend this game atm. It still has a lot of potential, just not right now.

Mannn i just want a refund."
1609681475,"A visually and aurally pleasing, but overall shallow, action/adventure game that was advertised as an RPG.  RPG in this context seems to mean Action-adventure/Open World with the faintest illusion of authority over outcomes, character individuality and story direction. Pretty much every ""V"" is going to play more or less the same. The only meaningful difference will be in the ending. This would be fine had the game not been advertised as possessing a far deeper and expansive array of RPG elements. For me, all of this meant that the game was enjoyable for about 50 hours. Cyberpunk 2077 is not a bad game; it just isn't the game that CD PR advertised. With the above mentioned caveats, I would recommend it to fans of dystopian future/cybernetics and action adventure games."
1609666260,"I've played more complete beta releases. Games crashes, runs at about 15 fps on the lowest settings with an rtx 2060. Steam refused to give me a refund even though it is clearly faulty software, they claim I've played it too much, hilarious way to lose £50 considering it takes 2 hours to start the game. Also twice now I've come to boot it up and the terrible steam thing (like seriously what is this steam rubbish that gets in the way of people who make games and people who want to buy them!!??) has forgotten that it's installed... an all round embarrassment for the industry. So glad I spent £1000 on a laptop that both project red and steam said would run this game, not even close. To top it off they won't refund me or even reply to a message. I guess PC gaming is now as dead and inaccessible as console gaming is to normal people with jobs and bills.

If anyone knows any settings that will allow the game to even run I'd greatly appreciate the help."
1609666154,"Fantastic game, story is amazing, rpg elements like the stats and skills are very fun, if I even had any bugs they were fixed super quickly, amazing game, 10/10."
1609665922,"I looked down and could see my feet.

10/10"
1609665723,"Buggy at launch, but still a great game."
1609665692,anyone who says the bugs annoy them must not know its part of the cyberpunk experience

1609665450,"Amazing, fun and whole lotta action."
1609665415,Cmon it is a good game!
1609665275,"wasted £50 on this, massive regret. should have purchased it on gog for the longer return window"
1609665084,"Bugs....Sure the game has its quirks but it also has a great story line and plenty of replay value. The mechanics are sweet, the side quests can even really suck you in if its your cup of tea. I'd say give it a little more time if you want a polished GEM but if you can handle some great content with some FUNNY and sometimes annoying BUGS then you will NOT BE disappointed!!"
1609664928,"An incredible, memorable ride from start to finish. Night City is awe-inspiring, and the story and characters you meet along the way are just as good. Cyberpunk will be remembered as one the best games of the decade. A true masterpiece on many fronts."
1609664926,"Fucking amazing game. The city is incredible, the story has been great so far and even the side missions are fun. I'm sorry to the people who's systems won't let them play this game as it's one of the best I've ever played. It has far exceeded my expectations"
1609664914,the game is a waste of time tbh there nothing fancy about it its not bad but id pay 20 buck for it
1609664838,"The game may be glitchy, but, underneath that is a solid game, that is beautiful, with great music. Just, get it. Or wait til the bugs are patched"
1609664770,"Behind all this bugs and unfinished stuff is a really great game, a awesome world with beautiful ideas, style and opportunities and a good, but not awesome, story. But at the moment I can't say ""play it"" because of all the unfinished stuff. I still believe in CDPR to do something awesome, but it needs a bunch of patches. If you really want to play it, you can play it, its playable overall, but its not finished to be a instant ""classic"". If you are not sure if you gonna like it or you are afraid of the patches, wait some weeks until you buy it. I liked it, but I can't recommend it for the average gamer."
1609664477,"Polecam. 

Recomended."
1609664456,"People overhyped this game to heights that CD PROJEKT RED could have never possibly delivered. However, despite the bugs and rough edges lies a fun game and a compelling yet tragic story.

Defiantly a must-play for fans of the genre, setting, or tabletop RPG.

1609664358,"Ive tried to like this game despite all the bugs, but i just cant anymore. It's dog shit."
1609664317,"Story is great. Wish there was better end game though, hopefully DLC gives us it."
1609664291,buggy but cool af
1609664107,"If you can run it and you're slut for worldbuilding (like I am) then it's incredible and you should play it. if you can't run it, then hopefully you can in 6 months."
1609664065,"This game is hot trash, from bugged missions to a boring story. Was it just me or did anyone else think character customization was going to be amazing? In reality it's trash and talk about how choices didn't mean shit, such a linear cop out game. So many glitches from audio constantly pooping up that doesn't haven anything to do with your mission at the time to not being able to pick up stuff. I really don't understand why this game was hyped so much. It's a shit story with nothing new to bring to the table. Auto saving sucks ass because it never save at a good time, if you die you could lose 10 minutes of valuable game time due to random fuck ups or enemies seeing you through walls. This game only deserves the award for  the most ""hyped shit basic game"""
1609664057,I went into this game blind not knowing anything other than who Judy was. I never followed anything other than the delays. With that being said I understand the criticisms it has and it deserves it. Empty promises are sadly nothing new in the industry and with pressures from high ups to release games sooner deliveries like cyberpunk do happen. A lot of the game has bits that feel unfinished or at the very least rushed. Where this game shines is really the characters and atmosphere. You will be driving to do some work for Takemura and drop whatever you're doing just to help Panam or Judy out on the other side of the city. The atmosphere is incredible in night city where violence and sex are abundant and the only thing that sells. The story is good too but the ending depending on which you get leave some plot lines unresolved. All this said it is a good game but don't let other's opinions taint too much of your own on this game. Hopefully with additional content and future expansion packs we will see this game glisten like CD Project Red's other gem that is The Witcher III The Wild Hunt. 7/10
1609664051,"Despite occasional bugs and missing features promised from the trailer, the story and characters make the game unforgettable for a period of time."
1609663989,Great Game
1609663962,"Buggy but fun to play! Could have been the best game ever if polished, finished, and actually had the things it said it would have."
1609663910,"Really good game . i play it trought , its really good.
The glitches and bugs its many but all other its pretty good !
I will wait for a major update then play it again , they said it will be in january ....
Sooo i would recommended for new players but not yet , wait a little bit , it will be a very very good game with all new updates and dlc-s !!!!! :D"
1609663835,Yeah
1609663782,"At most this game is a 5.3/10 or a 4/10 the main story feels so short and half assed. Especially when you first meet jackie and they cut alot of the content making your friendship feel so cheap, and forced to make somthing interesting. some of the side quest choices say that it makes an impact but it really doesnt lol....like i could have chosen the worst options and all lead to the same exact outcome which feels great :).....But i do like the relationship between judy and riven and etc but after you romance them they pretty dont have anything new or interesting to do but be glued to their house and have shitty small talk. The AI is a joke of its self. Especially AdamSmasher he was hyped to be a THREAT but he comes off as a joke and a push over and can be killed with a dildo-bat with ease. The cars either feel like running on butter or stiff as a dick. But the wrost thing i gotta say is the customization is FUCKING DOG-SHIT, ive seen worst games have better customizations and they were fucking free. you cant change your looks AT ANY TIME which is fun, cant customize your car, guns, fucking anything and the option too feel ass. The colors for the hair feel like a colorblind person did them, (but thats just me) Other then that this game isnt 60$ at all. and should be about 40$ or 45$...

-Ps: people who say this game is 8/10 or higher are insane."
1609663766,Aside from bugs this has been a fun experience. Basically GTA set in the future.
1609663868,Best game in 2020. All the side stories are so much fun and some of them interacts with each other. You can get up to 100 hrs of fun playing time from this game.
1609663287,"Great game, just a few bugs here and there"
1609663243,"This game has more bugs than windows vista at launch. A shame since it was one of the most expected games of 2020.
The game will be great to play in about 6 to 8 months.
Thank you,

1609663189,This game really makes you FEEL like a 2077!
1609663039,"Although the game has its bugs if you have played any bethesda title or any new open game at launch you will be use to this. Engaging story, very connectable characters havent finished yet so far ive enjoyed my 63 hours playthrough,"
1609662956,Awesome game super wow!
1609662333,"glitchy but still fun af
"
1609662373,"A 8/10 game for me. Finally 100% this game today with all achievements, I had previously encountered a bug which the NCPD encounter failed to complete. I have to load older saves and constantly remind myself to keep multiple manual saves afterwards.

I would recommend this game after all the small glitches and bugs has been fixed, such as temporary bald when wearing head dress and enter vehicles, T-posing NPC and enemies, flying vehicles due to stacking and some other minor bugs. I also saw some obvious incomplete features such as the missing perk build, metro/rail system, underwater stages and 6-month story gap. Cyberpunk 2077 (PC) is a great game so long as it keeps to its promises."
1609662226,Runs fine on my computer. The plot is pretty cool and the world is super detailed and fun to look at
1609662031,"While the bugs can be jarring and some may cause you to revert to last save, the overall game is amazing. This is coming from a very high end pc user, but it's the best looking game I've ever played with a gripping story."
1609662044,"достойная игра, есть вопросы к сюжету и общим недоработкам, но в целом заслуживает внимания"
1609661990,a good game despite the bugs and glitches
1609661934,"buggy and the story / gameplay doesn't make sense until 15 or so hours, but it does get pretty addictive once it all comes together."
1609661900,game has glitches but runs well overall on my setup. Good CPU and GPU recommended
1609661871,"I waited a week or two before purchasing this game due to the amount of bugs that people were experiencing.  Now I know the game still is buggy for a lot of folks and I've ran into a few myself but nothing that's been game breaking as of yet.

With that said I would recommend this game.  I know CD Projekt Red will put more work into the game to get it fixed which will help the game out a lot.  But the world is very well designed and am constantly getting lost just looking everywhere I can.  I would also have to say with what I've played of the campaign so far its been very fun.  Keeps you intrigued for sure.  In all if your hesitant due to bugs and want to wait then give them some time and come back when the game is maybe on sale or at a lower price.  If you can get over some of the dumb bugs then I would say it's worth the money."
1609661807,Game ain't run good
1609661757,"It's buggy, broken, but it is still fun and playable. They did promise that they will fix the game so I guess that's a relief if they do decide to keep that promise."
1609661704,Grate game
1609661651,Shallow and full of lies but sometimes fun
1609661414,its a great game on a decent machine. dont try to play this on minimum specs yet
1609661388,"Unacceptable product. Buggiest unfinished game I have ever played which is very unfortunate given how hyped I was for the game on release. I recommend purchasing other CD Projekt Red games such as The Witcher 3. Do not purchase this product it will disappoint, it's an overly-ambitious mess rushed out the door to make money which is very uncharacteristic of the developer."
1609661323,"It's big.
It's crack.
The bugs are the feature.
And it doesn't run on a potato.
If you thought it would, that's your own damn fault, not CDPR's, They warned you all 4 years ago it would be a system crusher for years to come. That 6 year old brick you tried running it on anyways? Your problem. Not theirs."
1609661195,PEEPEEPOOPOO
1609661096,yikes
1609660970,"Bad game. I've never had a game consistently auto-save in scenarios where I'm dead already as bad as cp. Playing on harder difficulty is not rewarding, you'll die in one hit without any knowledge of what killed you or how to avoid it. Clunky shooting, very limited movement options, practically dick-all nothing in the way of cars. This game was supposed to have flying cars, where are the flying cars?"
1609660831,"Amazing graphics, enticing gameplay, solid story. with a handful of bugs.  6 months post release, this will hopefully be polished and perfected, but it's still a fantastic game in the meantime, if you have the hardware to run it."
1609660789,"Personal Review:
- This game is so buggy it's hilarious and emblematic of the gaming industry as a whole: Grab the cash now and fix it maybe later. And since I haven't played the Witcher series and they turned out alright I can safely assume that they might fix this hopeless excuse for a ""immersive game."" I do recommend this game for the future if you really care about being immersed in a game but if you don't it's a fun game to laugh at. Not with, at.

Synopsis:
- In this game play as Robo Man and play with space and time itself as you slow down time to get from the north end of the map to the very bottom of the map in a matter of seconds from quest to quest. While trying to remove a terrorist nano-disease from your brain should be top priority it simply isn't as you grab a myriad of top hats, random sports t-shirts and a tube skirt in order to min-max your character's build only to throw it all away because pistols are the best guns in the game. There's a ton of busy work in it and will definitely be fun for about 15 minutes before the bugs beat all your interest away.

Graphics:
-Good, great. You can see the T-Posing Model's every orifice glistening in the sunlight of Night City and the gleam of a cool car flinging itself sideways before falling in the road to the void below for no apparent reason.

Gameplay: 
- Fun, not COD fun but hey, you got options to hack, shoot and stab people as Robo Man. Unfortunately that is all you will be doing in the game. Everything revolves around this. Robo Man only knows one thing on the streets and that is violence or hiding eating inhalers while bullet sponges slowly forget you exist. It is not an RPG, there's stats in the game yes but you'll mostly either be doing hacking shooting or stabbing people very gud and for everything else you're hiding in a corner healing.

Story: 
- Yeah that's a thing in it. If you don't think about it too hard and you aren't annoyed at your phone constantly interrupting virtually everything you're doing and keeps you from doing anything then yeah it's great. The NPC's also really do wild things in the background which is more fun to watch for in the cutscenes."
1609660773,"It's a lesser to the Witcher 3 in terms of RPG mechanics. But night city feels alive and lived in. (Just put AI on medium, so less dumb AI collisions will happen.) Hey they lied to us, cut a bunch of cool content, and trolled the console kids. But I'd still say it's better than Skyrim or Fallout 4. So take that as a recommendation if you want... 
   If your still on the fence, just hold off for the performance updates, and free DLC. Also try cloud gaming like XCloud if you have poopy hardware, heard it works well for a lot of people."
1609660331,"I really  don't see why people are so upset about this game. It's not perfect, but lots of games aren't and I don't see how Cyberpunk was any different. 
Yes, there are some things that I found mildly annoying - quite dumb AI, maps when you're driving and miss your turn every time, because the map is too zoomed in. There were some minor bugs as well - T-shaped V sticking out of the car, phones hanging in the air, twice the game crashed, but it wasn't game breaking and I've had far worse experience with some of the recent titles of the same kind, where bugs made the game unplayable. In Cyberpunk I can overlook most of them.
Having said things that I didn't enjoy, I had fun playing it, lots of fun, and I am quite excited to start my second playthrough now that I know what to expect from the game and what mistakes not to make. Is the game fun? Yes. Is the story good? Yes. My boyfriend and I played it shoulder-to-shoulder and could tell right away how different our choices played out, starting with small things and finishing with game changing choices. The story is written well and the characters resonated with me a lot. i either loved them, or hated them, but I definitely didn't feel indifferent about them. And finally was the game stunning? Yes, I found myself wandering in awe endlessly, forgetting about the missions. it's a good game"
1609660328,"City looks amazing on pc, what it should be played on anyways. Fight game play is super fun and the game is very immersive overall. The colors are insane."
1609660307,":c 
i wanted this to be way better than it is, it was fun for the first 10 ish hours but quickly became very repetitive.
i thought maybe what character origin you chose mattered, it doesn't you get may 10 min of different game in the beginning.
ok maybe not too bad maybe the character builds are fun to experiment with........ nope.
tried stealth, gunning, and slice n dice and it all just feels so easy and overpowered so quickly ( even on the highest difficulty)
it's kind of a cool world. but meh, there's a few completely pointless perks in the skill tree that you absolutely never use. 
I honestly don't think i'll pick this back up, there is just simply a huge lack of content. the world looks fullish but just feels empty, boring, and pointless when you play.
PROS: 
- Looks pretty ( when not bugging out )
- It's a cool story to play through
- Panam be cute.

Cons:
- no replayability 
- side quests are kinda cool but get repetitive very quickly
- if you do anything before continuing the story you'll quickly out level all the enemies
- skill tree is seemingly intuitive but ends up not mattering much at all
- playing an archetype ( stealth, brawler or gunner type ) doesn't really make any difference in any aspect of the game.
- driving is shite
- gunplay is extremely boring 
- loot/ crafting / items are hot trash, no value to items, rarity really doesn't quite matter, the special weapons are always garbage compared to regular a** guns you find everywhere even after upgrades.

I honestly don't know if i just anticipated too much with this release but i just can't really stand behind cyberpunk 2077 
it packs a punch for the first couple hours the just lays down and dies on you.
i wanted so much to be able to play this game so much more.
Wait for a sale or something T-T

1609660292,Amazing game
1609660222,"Had a lot of fun with this game with a few glitches but nothing game breaking like I've seen for other people. I enjoyed the main story but I would argue that the side quests are the best part about this game. I enjoyed Panam's story line and joined the Nomads for the last mission which gave me a satisfying ending. The acting is top notch and kept me engaged the whole way through, although I felt a little disappointed with the amount of times I was forced to sit and listen without much to do. This is fine in small amounts but a lot of the main story feels this way, which is why I preferred the side missions. The world is extremely dense with lots to see, I hope they considering bringing this to VR as it would be an extremely interesting world to get lost in. I think more time should have been spent on this game to really polish it up and bring a true next gen experience, it's a good game but it did nothing new or groundbreaking whatsoever. I'd give it a 7.5/10, although for lower performing PC's your experience may be significantly worse.

Driving is some of the worst I've ever seen. The open world feels completely dead, NPCs are boring and give no real interaction.

Raytracing will drop the FPS like from 20-30FPS. I've played it on a 3840x 1600 with the same PC 2080TI, same settings, but I have to enable g-Sync, then it averages about 70-90FPS, no raytracing. My son has no issues running it with about 60FPS on a 980ti, with high settings, no raytracing, on a 1080p display. Just to give you all an idea.

1609658127,One of the best single player games ever made
1609658093,Runs okay on PC and I'm having fun.
1609658071,"I want to really like this game, after 81 hours, thought I would, but man it falls flat on so many levels. On my second play through now.  **POTENTIAL SPOILERS**

 Lets get the good stuff out of the way before we attempt to butcher this.  

Good stuff - if your PC can hold it, the graphics in this game are amazing.  I'm running this on Ultra with some slight tweaks, so I don't lose FPS.  I highly recommend anytime a NPC offers to drive, to not skip it.  It's worth it to just sit back and really see how good this game looks.

The music/sound effects equally great.  It's hard to find anything on the radio that isn't great, or makes you want to listen to it more.  The random sounds from machines and people are equally clear and entertaining.  

The characters/story - welcome to what really holds this game together.  From the main mission to the side story missions, it's the characters that really keep you locked in.  The story itself is equally good with some choices that affect certain outcomes (not many, they are there).  Again I highly recommend doing the actual story until you play the story until you get Reeves's character.  Not only is it awesome to have him with you, but he adds dialogue to almost every mission.  I ended up doing so many side missions on my first play through I miss out on a lot.

So that's the good.....that's it.  Rough I know, but we have to mark off what turns a potential great game into almost a terrible game.

Hype - first off let's go after everyone here.  I almost pre-ordered this since I thought CDPR could do no wrong, especially since I've enjoyed the witcher series.  This is a failure of fans/I assume stock investors/CDPR themselves just shitting the bed on this.  CDPR should have just told everyone fuck off this is going to be on hold for another year.  It would have saved them the embarrassment of things that just shouldn't have happened.  Also don't show shit that won't happen in game.  I legit loved in the opening video where your character throws a gun at someone then plugs them with another.  All I could think was, man I want to do that....yeah that isn't happening.  Time could have turned out well thought out ideas into something great.

AI - the AI in this game is a joke.  Literally a joke.  Sometimes mobs are so idiotic that they stand there while you plug away at them and nothing happens to you in return.  NPC's other than the main ones are basically filler for the game that take up space for no reason.  Shoot your weapon and nothing bad happens and everyone flees.  I hate to try and compare different games, but at least in GTA's they fight you back.  Also difficulty doesn't seem to change how they act either just the damage received. Mobs are still brainless drones.  The only time the AI apparently doesn't suck is if you try to stealth around.  You're caught once?  Well enjoy having the AI always knowing where you are even if you move around about 40 yard in any direction.  Also the AI loves to keep combat going for long lengths of time when you start to run away.  The only time this never seems to happen is when your being chased by the cops.  Run 100 yards away, oh shit he disappeared!  Also the random cops spawning in the middle of no where is absolute garbage.  Run over someone?  Oh here's 3 cops you never saw around you.

Mods/Crafting - put together as one since I would write 4 paragraphs on each if I could.  The crafting system is a joke.  You have to literally single click an enormous amount of times if you want to turn components into the next stage up.  At one point I had 6000 common scrap units, it took 30 mins just to get to 5000, that's how bad it is.  Mods equally not thought out.  There's maybe 6 to 7 total mods in this game, all of them are trash for weapons.  Same for your armor.  Roughly maybe 5 to 6 you will ever actually use, if you even remember to.  They provide nothing that helps you later.  

Cybernetics - again another thing that just falls flat.  You have roughly 16 mods you can put in your body, all of them except maybe 4 mean anything.  The only 2 mods even worth having is arms for cool random effects like rockets shots or mantis blades and the double jump mod.  The game actually becomes fun with double jump.  You  can move more freely.  The mod they could've tossed in should have been some Mirrors Edge wall jumping.  It would have been great.

Travel - vehicles in this game are legit trash.  There's maybe 2 to 3 vehicles that actually feel good driving.  Everything else either turns 90 degrees after barely touching the stick or never does.  Vehicles can't flip, there's nothing to stop you from absolutely beating the shit out of em either.  Eventually they suffer total damage, but don't worry, walk 60 yards away and re-summon it!  Zero flying vehicles when you literally enter one at the beginning as a corpo.  No modding the vehicles either.  I mean it's 2077 and I can't mount a gun onto the vehicle?  I mean I guess some of them look good?

Weapons - again another thing that just feels like a let down.  I've tried multiple specs and honestly you can make them all good and have fun with them, but the amount of options you have in guns feels almost Borderlandsish.  Here's you set amount of gun types and let me spin the random wheel.  Mods on guns equally disappointing.  The potential salvation to weapon is melee weapons.  Again only so many, but it's extremely satisfying to take a hammer or bat and just slap the shit out of people.  Issue there is I'm tired of seeing the same death animation for kills over and over.

Combat - I'd actually toss this into the positive side....IF THE SAME DAMN COMBAT MUSIC WOULD STOP PLAYING.  It's ridiculously loud and obnoxious as nothing I've ever played.

BDs - a great concept it really is.  It's just so cobbled together you have no idea what their intentions were in the first place.  You can buy BD's in game, guess what, they don't ""work"" for your model.  Really?  That's the excuse?

Game within a game - again CDPR has a chance again to strike at gold similar to GWENT.   We all know the real reason we play Witcher 3.  It isn't for Geralts adventure.  They even spawned 2 decent games off it.  Here in CP2077 we have arcade games everything, pachinko machines, a gambling den and you can't do shit with it.  Know why sandbox games are fun?  It's for all the other shit you can do in the game.  RDR2?  Poker  GTV5 a slew of shit you can do.  

The minimap - I hate this thing with every part of my being.  It's so zoomed in that you can barely tell when to make a turn.  There are actual races in this game, where all they had to do was take that concept and add it to normal navigation.  That's it.  You could even ditch the minimap and only have it appear during combat.  It would've been great.

Bugs - ok so I can't harp to harshly on this.  Every game has bugs.  Skyrim, a game that's been ported how many times now?  Considered one of the best RPG's of the times, and it's literally bug city, so I don't want to hear about it.  I've only ran into 2 game breaking bugs, and at most I only lost 3 hours of time.  Most of the bugs are more or less inconvenient.  

Dead space - my biggest gripe out of everything.  So much built in this game for absolutely no reason.  The bad lands could be extremely impressive, but its not.  I know it's supposed to be the desert, but literally wildlife no longer exists?  They dedicate almost 1/8 of the total map to the solar panels that power NC, and you only have to go there twice.  Looks impressive, does nothing.  There's too much of that in this game.  Way too many perma locked doors, buildings you can never see unless it's in a mission, it just doesn't make any sense.  Heck I know there's places I'll never see, but why should I when nothing is designed to take me there.  Visually it looks great, but it's a waste.  

Overall I give this game a 4/10 for now.  It'll be 2 years before this game is ""finalized""."
1609657980,Game is Great
1609657958,"I had an excellent time playing through most of the Side Jobs and Main Jobs. This is an incredibly detailed world that has left a lasting impression on me, even with the technical issues and lack of specific features. The only reason I'm not instantly engaging in another play-through is that I'm going to let it all sink in for a bit and see what the next month or two of updates brings. 
Worth it at full price and definitely a steal at anything cheaper."
1609657945,"Biggest scam in Video Games History!, sadly you will realize that after you played long enough to loose your refund, this game is emptier than it looks it is designed to keep you busy for a few hours but you'll get to that line soon, (the point of no return) where you'll realize GTA V  is way more complex than this ""new gen game"", people say, ""wait till they fix it"" but replaying while waiting another 4 years for a descent fix for this dead end broken story is the stupidest thing you can do at least right now, the idea was good but it didn't receive the respect it deserve (by who ever tf pushed it without understanding a damn thing about what they had on their hands)."
1609657941,"Im going to give a short simple review of the game.


if you remember the meme from fallout76 of the dude yelling at the people on the couch playing the game and ends up saying quit having fun?. apply that meme to this game hour and a half into the game and im having a blase. screw what others say if you want the game get it its fun that's all."
1609657902,"The story alone makes this my favorite game of the year. Bugs, which are numerous, can be fixed with patches but what needs to be good like characters and voice acting are amazing. If the bugs shy you away than maybe wait a month or three for the latest patches to come out. Also Panam"
1609657901,While it has its problems.. the world is vast the stories are pretty amazing and the potential will only get better with the fixes and improvements
1609657804,"I haven't had any of the game breaking bugs happen to me, just hit the title screen in game after 51 hours played. It's a lot of fun. Have had the Fallout/Elder Scrolls type NPC glitches and stuff, but those are fun to me so I don't mind it. I've been having a good time just rolling around the city and doing side missions."
1609657654,"awesome game so far, so much done right. some bugs as people have shouted about but nothing more than minor so far in the game. its worth it."
1609657632,"Gameplay-wise, there's not much new ground broken with this game, but it does improve upon elements of the FPS RPG genre. The gameplay reminds me of Deus Ex, only with more customization, more variable level design for the side gigs and set pieces, and better writing all around. Where the game truly shines is in the design of Night City. The open world reminds me of GTA, only with much more painstaking attention paid to small details and immersion. It's the most immersed I've ever felt in an open world RPG game, and if you're a fan of ambience, world building lore, and immersion this game is hard to beat. 

And true to form for CDPR, the writing for many of the quests and characters are among the best in any RPG I've played. There have been many moments where I really felt bad about the way a certain quest turned out and reloaded an earlier save to get a better ending, something I typically don't bother to do. I can think of several moments in the game that truly blew me away from a visual storytelling/lore building perspective, enough so that I can't wait to play this game again with fresh eyes down the road."
1609657584,willy
1609657578,Feels like 70% of the best game ever. No better way to explain it.
1609657545,"At Patch 1.06: An extremely flawed game, both in scope and finality. There are a few good story lines in the game, but they are few and far between, the main story itself is bad at best, with the myriad bugs ( in my playthrough, floating meat, objects being replaced with guns sticking out of peoples heads, etc ) and other experience breaking issues such as a guitar riff playing for the next 3 hours of gameplay, UI boxes bugged on screen, and multiple characters talking at once on the video phone, CyberPunk 2077 destroys itself. Not that the writing itself is good, the beats are all present, but without any sort of build up for the emotions being displayed on screen, its hard to really get invested in the characters. 

Cyberpunk gets a 1/10 for the story (River's story being the most enjoyable 7/10), and 8/10 for the environment, Overall I'd give this game a 4/10. Wait until the ""ultimate edition"" comes out in 2 years where all the reminders of systems not implemented have been fleshed out and done properly.

This game is best viewed as Skyrim with a Futuristic Flair, bugs, jank, and all."
1609657533,"story was decent, could be better but could be worse. very interesting characters and plots
gameplay as a whole is just a looter shooter, go around killing random enemies and picking up their junk and random junk you find
gunplay feels ripped straight from borderlands, with bullet spongy enemies and tier ranked weapons
stealth has as much depth as just walking behind someone lol
city doesn't have much to it other than being a pretty loading screen for going from point a to point b
ai (if it even exists) does the absolute bare minimum to be somewhat convincing as real people
bugs are a huge problem, there's been a few points in the game where i had to restart from a save because some trigger or something wasn't activated to let me move on, though most bugs you'll  encounter will just be something funny that'll make you laugh. worst bug i've encountered was the game randomly refusing to launch!

really don't know if i can recommend the game, i was pretty into the story but everything else about the game falls flat"
1609657478,It's just... not good.
1609657463,"Great game with lots to do and explore. Interesting story, characters, and lore. Fun to play with lots of different gameplay options. Yes there are bugs including some graphical, animation, and sound glitches. I didn't experience any crashes though, nor any game breaking bugs. Playing on i9 Intel, RTX 2080 GPU at 1440p with high settings, high ray tracing, and DLSS set to Quality. Got mostly 60 FPS. 

I fully plan to reply a with a new character to experience some other story lines and endings."
1609657449,"Honestly, the bugs are a big issue atm which makes the playthrough a pain."
1609657408,"This game is fucking bad. I like it, but I like bad games. Also Keke the Adopted Tabby Cat makes an appearance!"
1609657385,it's shit
1609657325,"Great game, but not the one we were promised.

7.5/10"
1609657264,"Masterpiece. Simply one of the best games ever made. Compelling stories, amazing attention to details, emotionally charged music, characters have depth of souls rarely seen in other titles. The talents of CDPR's production team has truly put together an incredible work of art. Only pity was bad management."
1609657185,Best game i have played yet. go and buy. then enjoy 23 fps at max with rtx on and 2077 constant. 10/10
1609658198,"Just beat this after 79 hours.  The game is [i]very good[/i], but at the time of writing it's rife with flaws.  I hope the free DLCs and patches address problems and flesh out systems which could use more work instead of simply adding on additional quest chains, but we'll see if that happens.  Cyberpunk definitely could have used another quarter or two of development, but I think the negative hype surrounding it is vastly overblown.  Looking forward to my next playthrough.

[h1]PROS:[/h1]
*  The most appealing world I've seen in a game to date.  I'm talking strictly from an art direction and level design perspective.  Night city is [i]undeniably beautiful[/i]; each of the city's districts and subdistricts feel distinct and recognizable (it's very rare that I'm able to tell where I am in such an expansive map simply by looking around for a second or two).  The verticality is a welcome obstacle, honestly, and I love how [i]dense[/i] the world is.  Aside from the well-documented problems with minimap navigation, the world is easy and a joy to traverse, too (with fast travel options being unlocked as you discover more travel points in the world).
*  Fantastic characters.  I thoroughly enjoy everyone I've come across, and I can't wait to spend more time with them.  This game is up there with the greats.  The characters are complex, not chock full of eye-roll-inducing tropes, and not all their paths always lead to the ideal outcome one might wish for.  The writing for them is mostly very sharp and convincing. 
*  Great world building between random lines being dropped, all the ingame text, ads, conversations with random passers by, the ingame database, etc.  Reading the descriptions for all the cars was a lot of fun.
*  Great character leveling mechanics.  While there [i]are[/i] a number of perks which don't seem particularly useful, and many of these are simple X% stat increases, there is so much to toy around with and unlock that I see many, many ways to rebuild my V in the future.  There are also 5 separate character stats which are upgraded when you level [i]in addition to[/i] each skill tree having its own separate progression path which unlocks additional passives.  I mean, [url=https://game8.co/games/Cyberpunk-2077/archives/309686]look at this[/url].  This may not be on the level of something like Grim Dawn, but [b]people saying this isn't an RPG are out of their damn minds[/b].
*  [b]Your choices definitely matter[/b].  I have no idea why people are saying they don't.  I have numerous friends who have played this and talked with me about it and each of us has different outcomes in main and side missions (not necessarily gigs and other tertiary content, though).  Not to mention the numerous, wildly different endings...
*  The music is fantastic.  Songs like [i]Rite of Passage[/i], [i]The Heist[/i], [i]When It's War[/i], [i]Delicate Weapon[/i], [i]Night City[/i], [i]Suicide[/i], and many, many others pull from a wide variety influences, are recorded by a lot of artists (mainstream and underground) who are innovators in their field (dude, RTJ, Gazelle Twin, and Grimes made music for this game...).   There are some straight-up bangers in here and the OST definitely rivals, if not surpasses, GTA V.
*  Lots of options when it comes to combat.  I went for a combination of guns blazing and hacking (both before and during combat).  Hacking was very effective, but like the Witcher 3 enemies feel very, very tanky on harder difficulties.  Still, I always felt there were a lot of options.  [b]I would highly, highly recommend leveraging quick hacking to have the best time possible[/b].  
*  Some really game-changing unlocks.  Mantis blades, high-jump legs, and some of the quick hacks really shifted the way I played the game in a pretty big way (the legs in particular).
*  Absolutely stunning graphics.  Undeniably the best looking game I've ever played.  Raytracing is fantastic, scene complexity is fantastic (depending on where you are, I guess), lighting is amazing, and the overall art direction, as previously mentioned, is sublime.
*  Tons and tons of content. Well over a hundred quests & gigs, and that's not mentioning random encounters and other time sinks.

[h1]CONS:[/h1]
*  Performance. As of 1.06 the game runs very, very poorly.  I have a 2080 SUPER and a 3700x, both liquid cooled, and I run medium/high settings with DLSS set to [i]quality[/i] and RTX off.  50-80fps is my range at 1440p with this rig, and that drops significantly lower if I turn DLSS off (30fps with medium settings on a high-tier GPU like this is just not good).  Additionally, the game runs worse the longer you have it running.  I'm willing to write off certain things, particularly RTX and Ultra/Psycho settings as boundary-pushers, much like features seen in games like Crysis, but there's certainly a lot of work which can and needs to be done to help this (judging from console performance, especially).  Additionally, CDPR mentioned the hex edit to modify the GPUOpen lib incorrectly getting core counts for Ryzen CPUs is no longer necessary and has been addressed with the help of AMD, and I want to believe them, but it's simply not the case for me.  Without a new edit applied, i can very clearly see CPU load is very, very uneven across all my cores, but becomes even once the edit is applied.  I think they should revisit this.
*  Lots and lots of jank, and it approaches near unplayable levels towards the middle.  I'm talking everything from [url=https://youtu.be/1gHUWXZwBlU]goofy shadows[/url] to [url=https://youtu.be/D_NHysBZQcA]pure, unadulterated crap[/url].  They added a cool feature where you can text contacts in your phone, but even the damn message history gets all scrambled.  I had a god damn wetsuit on for about 60% of the playthrough and I was unable to equip armor because I went exploring in the badlands and found a quest item which couldn't be unequipped.  It's really sad they let it go out like this; what is an otherwise fantastic game became a giant internet meme because of it.
*  The enemies are way, way too tanky on higher difficulties.  Witcher 3 suffered from the same problem and I had to use mods to address it.  Will unfortunately have to do the same here.
*  Combat AI is unremarkable but passable, however the non-essential AI is really, really stupid.  I'm sure you've seen everything about police spawning out of thin air to the poor NPC reactions to player actions.  While not core to the experience, better NPC AI was definitely advertised and this is a huge let down.
*  Lots of unessential mechanics which one would expect in a game like this ([i]cough[/i] in no small part due to the marketing material...) aren't in it.  Vehicle customization is something CDPR was upfront about not having in the game, but I think it's needed here (the cars are really cool and varied - why must we be locked to a few preset configurations?).  No character aesthetic customization exists outside clothes swapping (you'll end up choosing between style and stats, though, which is a bummer).  Few minigames, which is a massive letdown after Gwent in Witcher 3 being such a fantastic addition to the game.  No 'sight-seeing' travel options, like a taxi cab or a train.
*  The big one: this game was massively overhyped.  Video game companies need to stop doing this.  Much of the community was expecting the second coming of christ, or at the very least a revolution within the industry.  I went in with my expectations largely tempered, but even with that I couldn't help but notice things which were talked about in the marketing material that weren't really in the game.  This is up there with Bioware launching copies of ME3 in to space.  I get that marketing is largely what makes a game successful, but at some point I think you set consumer anticipation far too high and you wind up having hundreds of articles in negative press when you don't live up to expectations.  This was such an avoidable mess."
1609656771,"Not bad

1609656760,10/10 broke my pc
1609656739,"Great RPG, would be wonderful but is a bit buggy for a game made in 2020."

1609656650,Works fine on my PC.
1609979167,"Don't get me wrong, its not perfect, and it definitely shouldn't have been released in this state. That being said, its a dope game with some seriously fun action and plenty of world-building to explore and experience. Still have 2-3 characters worth of playstyles to work with."
1609656274,its fun
1609656064,"not quite sure what the hell other people are talking about broken game and all this shit, but if your looking for a better playing grander scale and more morally weighed GTA then this is the game for you. just make sure your drivers are up to snuff yeah? it'll save you a fuck ton of frustration.
also maybe wanna look back through forums and other stuff for the witcher games launch day reviews cause i have a sneaking suspicion that it too had stuff people hated but now everyone keeps saying ""it masterpiece"" .-."

1609655664,Yes
1609655521,"Beautiful game, fun to play. Has glitches which may break immersion, but i have yet to find a game breaking glitch or crash. Could be that i am just lucky however."
1609655463,"Have a mixed feelings about this game, it's not a bad one but when you playing it and see all potential this game have its really a shame they rushed it..."
1609655457,"Not without it's bugs, but this game is a masterpiece. I don't know how they pulled it off."
1609655424,Not a RPG....
1609655245,"After playing 70+ hours of the game and completing almost all the side content i would give this game 8 out of 10.
Pros:
- Story is pretty engaging and had lots of fun quests.
- Hacking was a lot of fun and added an extra layer to stealth not seen in a lot of other rpgs.
- All important character were really cool and felt emotion depending on scenario.
- Side content was always fun and different
- different type of guns were refreshing for someone that does not play shooters often
- Katanas were really fun to use.
- Samurai band mission was best mission in game hands down.

Cons:
- Glitches were not so bad in the beginning but felt like i was reloading my save more often towards the end.
- Only see character 3rd person in mirror, customization screen, and last cut scenes which felt cheap.
- Cars were annoying to drive but not terrible.
- AI was very easy to take advantage of.
- wish there was more customization of weapons and vehicles.
- police AI was stupid drove a block to run away

Conclusion:
After playing it without bias of the media i was really enjoying the game and looking past the bugs because i was used to them playing games like skyrim and fall out. The story was really cool and i enjoyed being in this world and every hour spent i enjoyed. however, after looking at this game when completed it and seeing the broken promises and other peoples comment i can agree this game felt short on the delivery. With the glitches and other cons listed above thats why i docked it to an 8/10 and if they treat this game like witcher 3 i can def go up."
1609655230,"  Meh.. 
  Not at all worth the hype that it apparently garnished. (#1 Pre-Sold Copies)

1609655088,yes
1609655056,"Beautiful game with allot of potential to say the least... but Cyberpunk 2077 was definitely rushed near the end of its development.. the combat doesn't feel very satisfying, the game is filled with bugs, the graphical performance isn't optimized and the interaction with the world feels few and far in between. I want to recommend this game so badly but I can't until some of these keys things get addressed."
1609655017,its not bad.... just wish i could keep playing after the last main mission.

I liked my experience at first.  Then I loved it.  Then I grew to hate it.  I don't play games just for the story.  I play to experience everything within them.  If I can double jump, I should be able to double jump without landing on a pile of garbage and dying (7 times).  I should be able to walk into the street and step off a curb without dying (3 times).  I should be able to drive my car without it stopping and being unusable ever again (4 times).  There are a lot of shoulds throughout this game and my experience.  Every little bug, every little inconvenience piles on (Pile Up Principle) over the course of 102 hours to make my experience and love for this game terrible.  I hated every second after I got to a certain point.  I only had 10 achievements left, so I wanted to 100% it.  Something that should have only taken me an additional 10 hours took me 30 because of bugs.  Imagine being locked out of an achievement you meet the requirements for that requires you to get to the end game (and 50 rep) just for it not to pop?  Nope.  You gotta make a whole new save.  From poor physics, empty and hollow ""interactable"" NPCS, terrible movement mechanics, and code riddled with bugs and zero pesticide, this game was atrocious.  You can like the story.  It was pretty good, but nothing spectacular.  A cool concept nonetheless.  You can also enjoy this game.  But if you say, ""I haven't encountered any bugs and my experience is great,"" then you are either lying or blind.  Whether on the original PS4/Xbox One or some of the best computer hardware, the bugs in this game will deafen you to the ""hidden gem"" that lies within.  The gem has become so tainted that it will never reach what it could have been.  This game needed another year at most, and the hubris, lies, and poor management led to an overall terrible product with some cool things sprinkled in.  I can honestly say that I hate this game, and I don't want to touch it again.  If you want to play it, wait six months.  Don't do what I did, and don't let the hours fool you.  This game is currently awful, and the best story in the world cannot fix these issues.

Note: These are all my opinion.  I'm sure you could find joy in this game.  However, if you're on the fence, just wait it out or skip it altogether."

1609653174,good game
1609652977,"Kudos to the marketing team for all the work they did hyping this game. What I received was far worse than what I imagined this title would be. It's a buggy, stripped down RPG that has an incredible amount of potential. The GOTY version will probably be great, but the current version I simply cannot recommend."
1609652963,"PROs: Lots of unique story and world building quest.

CONs: You'll miss half of the unique story and world building quest details because you can't see anything in dark rooms, dark alleys, dark outdoors, dark outdoor scenes during the middle of the day, etc. looking for that random object in a dark room? Good luck with that! Changing gamma on your settings won't save you either...

Then, when you are not fumbling around in the dark you get to enjoy the wonderful experience of hundreds of police and drones showing up in the middle of nowhere because a stray bullet hit a civilian. Like, WTF did you call me for if all you cops are just standing around waiting to beat my @$$ for one mistake??? Do the job yourself!

Also, for those of us who use controllers, can we please have the ability to turn off that f*n car horn!?!?!? There is no option to rebind controller settings for vehicles and it is very annoying.

Finally, the talent system needs a rework. Most talents are sub par at best and you can completely go without, where as there are 3 or 4 in each tree that are overpowered or simply game breaking. Cyberware Mods like ""System Reset"" and ""Ping"" that can be acquired with only 1 talent point into 'craft legendary cyber mods' combined with a good cyberdeck will allow you to clear a whole building of enemies. Where as you can near max any melee skill tree and still get wrecked trying to clear easy content.

All in all, it is a decent starting point for a game that just came out. The story and concepts within will give the game good longevity as long as they continue to polish the game mechanics. Just like The Witcher 3, this game will be fully fleshed out in a year."
1609652918,"Very immersive world and story. Great for anyone interested in the cyberpunk/tech-noir genre.

I have completed every ending and still get the itch to go back. Can’t wait for future DLC."
1609652766,"Make Sure You can Run this game first, but very fun overall"
1609652684,"Ok even with the bugs and the  way too easy combat this game could be worth the buy but the driving absolutely  ruins it. The minimap is so zoomed in you will miss every single turn. The worst thing is in racing missions they have an on the road hud gps, why didn't you implement that into the rest of the game?"
1609652657,"The glitches exist, and they're not that bad if you're exceeding the recommended minimums"
1609652522,"I've had a lot of fun playing this game. It does have a lot of bugs but to be honest some of them are really fun too. But I hope that they fix all of them. The game looks really heavy and bad optimized, if you have a mid-low end PC you will have problems to get 60FPS even on the lowest settings. They need to optimize the game better.  Overall it is a really good game, the gun fights are intense and you can choose your prefered way to deal with the enemies. Stealth? Hacking? Guns? Brawl fights? Meele? Everything. This is great. I recommend the game, despites all bugs and bad optimization."
1609652356,"First off, everything about it is alright. except a few issues including one big one the CDPR could not finish due to rushed development at the end (not their fault....we know who we are). A few small bugs where, lips would sometimes stop syncing (no big deal), sometimes the environment would act funny (again, no big deal sometimes things will float and...i find it funny XD) but the big one that can rip the whole thing...THE DESERT. I won't say anymore. All CDPR will have to do is optimize the desert ESPECIALLY THE DESERT and anything else so it won't overclock or overheat pc's with a 580 AMD or anything similar to that. cuz even at minimum requirements....oh dear God almighty why did we rush CDPR. (sorry) Have a good year!"
1609652350,"

A quick note: I played this on a low-end PC, but because of that, my expectations for visual bugs are lower. 

The positives:

The moment I launched Cyberpunk 2077, the game almost immediately hooked me into its immersive world of Night City. I quickly got invested in the first main mission called “The Heist”, and was even emotionally invested in the supporting character Jackie. The combat in the game is exhilarating, giving the player four main options for playing through the various missions(Guns, Hacking, Melee, and Stealth), allowing and forcing players to mix and match these to create a unique playstyle for each person. The story was so great that I played through the entire main questline without completing any side quests (Besides Panam’s and Judy’s as their questlines are attached to the main one) on my first run through. On my second run of Cyberpunk, I completed the vast majority of the side quests, leveling my character up to level 50 (the maximum level), and was shocked to find that the critical decision making found in the main quest was still largely intact in even the more mundane ‘gigs’ albeit to a lesser level. While traversing the streets of Night City, I discovered a large cast of unique characters from a talking gun or vending machine to the future mayor of the city. The impacts you have on the world are massive, from bringing down or raising up a gang, to deciding the future of the biggest corporation and even helping determine the next mayor. There are also many little secrets hidden in the game, and each of these little easter eggs gives a feeling of accomplishment when you find them (especially the one pertaining to the secret final ending). While having the internet available to us now does greatly diminish this feeling, a player is fully capable of stumbling upon them without outside help, and that fact makes them feel special. This game feels like a combination of Borderlands and the Witcher and it is pretty fun. 

Each type and subtype of gun felt special in the way they can be used. For example, a smart shotgun and a power precision rifle are vastly different in their uses, making using each type of weapon feel special. The best experience of using weapons and armor in the game involves crafting them yourself, especially because the best items you can get in the game are made not found (even if the recipe for them is found), which gives a unique experience to many people as they find the type(s) of gun, bludgeon, or sword that fits them best. Any of these legendary items can be modded and/or upgraded to be the best weapon in the game, as no type of weapon is truly better than the other. The system of mods that the game has allows for even more customization.

Stealth is a legitimate option in the game, especially when combined with hacking to allow you to defeat a group of enemies without ever firing a shot. The option of a one-hit-kill in takedowns allows for a player without great weapons to take down many foes. The vast variety of options for hacking allows a player to choose how they wish to play, without really punishing the player for not using it at all. For example, you can do anything from making machinery malfunction to causing a person to kill himself. This allows players who would rather avoid a firefight a great option for dealing with enemies.

The developers have been rapidly patching the game, and are even adding DLC “early next year”, and the biggest of the bugs have been patched by now, with more being patched every day. 
 
A quick thing about one of the controversies surrounding this game (the accusations of transphobia), Cyberpunk is in many ways criticism of consumerist culture, of both the megacorporations and the customers that make it up. Because of this, there are some advertisements that you will see in-game that are degenerate. However, in one of the most fun side quests (a racing sidequest) the main character that you are helping is a person who is transgender. 

The negatives: 

	There are many visual bugs in this game, such as glitching smoke, and textures that do not load quickly or correctly often. These issues are of course going to happen unless you have the top hardware. Sometimes these can be comical (such as NPCs randomly T-posing), but they ultimately break some of the immersion of the game. Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that requires its players to save frequently just in case of a bug that is more serious than these visual issues. For example, an NPC may not talk with you or a door might not open, or a crafting material may not appear in your inventory once you obtain it. These bugs are a much bigger problem, and although CD Projekt Red’s team is fixing these constantly, there are still many of them out there.

	On a note of lesser importance, the game fails to explain the importance of crafting, and even though I would consider myself fairly well versed in RPGs, my first playthrough did not really go into crafting, and my experience was more negative for it. The same is true for the system of mods, in which Cyberpunk does not tell you that different mods scale differently on different weapons. A combination of crafting with weapon mods greatly increases the ability of a character to take down large groups of enemies. This shows as, on my first playthrough on the ‘normal’ difficulty, there were missions that bordered on impossible for my character to complete certain main missions, compared to my second run where my character beat the hardest mission (Don’t) Fear the Reaper on his first try on the hardest difficulty. The game also poorly explains implants and hacking, both of which can be integral parts of a person’s playthrough, requiring timely and costly in-game exploration of these features (and that’s if a player knows where to look). The gathering of materials that are necessary for crafting can be a grinding pain (unless an impatient player uses item duplicating exploits) These things mean that it is hard for someone not versed in open-world RPGs to pick up Cyberpunk 2077 and understand it, which could lead to a lot of frustration. 

	While each type and subtype of gun feel quite different from each other, melee weapons (with the exception of the implants of the mantis blades and monowire) do not feel too different from each other, and have limited variety in them. Even though one of the potentially best melee weapons found in Night City is a dildo, wielding it and using a wrench in-game do not feel different.

	There are some parts of the story, specifically the side stories, that seemed to have been bigger plots to immerse oneself in, but these plots were either not fully finished or were removed (possibly due to the game’s rushed launch). For example, one of the more fascinating stories is that of the future mayor of Night City, but while you get to uncover a massive conspiracy involving them, there is nothing that comes from there. There are many situations similar to this that the player will get excited to experience only to have the rug pulled out from underneath them as they realize that the rest of the plot is not yet in the game. Inconsistencies are also present occasionally, such as the fact that although the police are withdrawn from the districts of Pacifica and the Badlands, committing crimes in either of these places will cause them to spawn on you. The police in this game also do not arrive in cars or any form of vehicle, nor do they run at you, but rather blink into existence around you. These same cops will also fire on you for being in their sight for too long (despite having not committed a crime) but will forget about any atrocities you have done if you simply run several blocks away from them.


TL;DR:
	Although Cyberpunk has more than its fair share of bugs, and it’s systems are not always fully explained to the player, the game is immersive with a fantastic story and gripping combat.

Whereas LOU2 had a more profound and emotionally charged story, Cyberpunk is just downright more fun to play. I beat the game and then went back and actually completed all of the side quests and gigs. Each one is unique and fun, like the one where you help with a crucifixion brain dance. Each side quest is memorable and adds a depth to the game that makes it feel like I'm actually in Night City. Top 5 games I've ever played."

1609651862,"[u] HELLO PEERARMY [/u],
I have taken it upon myself to conceive and publish the [b] *FIRST EVER* [/b] critical review of Cyberpunk 2077. For my fellow GAMER ARMY, I have run this malware on my SuperGrafx emulator for Linux, so yes, I do have the flagship hardware that not all of you will be able to acquire in these times of dire need. NOTE: CDPROJEKTRED have taken the initiative of killing the epileptic. Although they did take this feature out of the product with a patch, this will still be taken into consideration due to the offensive nature of it, as my uncle is also dead (due to natural causes, may he rest in peace). With that note out of the way, we begin.

I was under the impression that this game ran ""surprisingly well"" on the older generations of consoles, so when I pulled out the TurboGrafx-16 and tried to run it I was severely disappointed to see that the game was unfinished. This failure was encapsulated in one particular NPC, and his name was Kerry. This NPC had a bug that made him hit on the male version of V, and this issue is pertinent to the survival to the game. However, I am happy to see that they are accepting of the LGTBQIA2s+ community through the means of Judy, a woman who is strong, independent, and quite intelligent. I am going to say one more thing about romances, I was severely disappointed to see the lack of Johnny Silverhand's ""impressive cock"" that was teased throughout the game and was left without a true man to romance. 

My final review for the game is that it runs as well as you would expect. 2072/2077 there is a little something for everyone...

Final Note: I did not receive this product for free"
1609653480,"Cyberpunk 2077 @CyberpunkGame Jul 2, 2018
Whole game is going to be a meme.

This is accurate..."
1609651558,"Feels like every other mission has some sort of bug. So much so that I can see them coming. Flip a switch before the mission tells you to? Softlocked. Finish a long main-story mission, but something goes wrong at the end? Softlocked. Idk, game-wise it's pretty good. But they really did push out a half-baked game if you can't get through it without constant game-breaking bugs. Sad"
1609651389,"If you have a good PC, then this game is actually pretty playable. I anticipate the bugs being fixed within a few months and content released, similar to NMS. Give this game a chance if you have the hardware, otherwise, hold off."
1609651372,"Despite the hate, I really love this game!"
1609651369,Beautiful game.  Fun and fulfilling side quests. Slightly buggy characters T posing for a half a second here and there but nothing anywhere close to game breaking. The cyberware and skill trees are a breathe of fresh air compared to most RPGs
1609651344,"Cybie vibes. The bugs keep things fresh. 

It's a great game and I'm addicted."
1609651211,"This game can be a buggy mess, but the the amazing details and incredible story crafting should leave something for every RPG fan to love. Third playthrough already and I look to many more!"
1609651178,"If you can look past the bugs and cut features and have a rig that can run it well, Cyberpunk is a great game full of memorable characters, cinematic story, fun and flexible gameplay, and gorgeous aesthetics. 

Give CDPR a little more time and the bugs and performance issues should be mostly gone. Hopefully the rocky launch won't put them off adding more content to the game, because I really am looking forward to starting up another new life in Night City."
1609651109,Great game aside from the bugs.
1609651090,"The game I was looking forward to for 7 years and couldn't stop promoting to everyone I knew... turned out to be a big steaming pile of bullsh*t.   The final straw was when I was trying to bring cyberpsychos in alive, took them down with non-lethal weapons, and then a bug in the game killed them and ended my mission with a different outcome than the one I chose.  I can't play a ""RPG"" that sabotages every decision I make and everything I work for at every step.    

Also  just watch any real, serious review of this game by people who actually played it.... the AI in it is literally less advanced than Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, a game from 2004.  This game is a brightly polished gilded turd.  The ONLY thing that works well in this game is the graphics, and only if you have a latest generation console or gaming PC.  Everything else is a lie.  Nothing is finished in this game except for the linearly scripted main story which is also full of bugs.   Everyone else isn't even half done, it is quarter done at best and probably 1/8th done on average.  

I don't blame the programmers/developers for this, they worked 70 hour weeks for a year.  I blame the lying POS company executives who manipulated and mislead everyone and treated the developers like slave labor.  These executives are scum that destroyed a beloved company, I hope they are all sued, bankrupted, fired, and can never get a job in the gaming industry or any IT company again.   It is so ironic that CyberPunk 2077 is about a corrupt dystopian corporate world, and the real life executives at CD Projekt Red did everything these fictional dystopian corporate overlords would do.  

I don't think a couple of patches are going to fix this game.  This game needs a massive overhaul.  Most accurate review on YouTube that I found:

1609651029,Cyberscam
1610101156,"TL;DR
the real thing

review:
Most bugs start to show if you really want to break the game. Lets say you piled up quest after quest and trying to access whole city when you should just pass the first quest, that will definitely break things. In that case, an item might get duplicated or bugged then you can't get rid of it. This is the case for first few hours of the game. You have to stick to the narrative first few hours or quests / quest items at yr inventory gets bugged.

Spoiler free example; there is a simple side quest called ""the gun"" at very first moments of the game. You gotta grab your weapon from a vendor on your path. Lets say you ignored and picked it up later. What happens? Weapon gets stuck at your inventory with (!)exclamation point. 

Another one; lets say you left the quest area without properly ending a dialogue wit h an NPC. Yeah npc might get stuck with you, follow u around etc.

Apart from this, there are inventory related bugs. Rest of the game is solid the gunplay, both lethal and non lethal is top notch. Stealth play is extremely fun and rewarding.

If you want perfected / bug free inventory management, get it later. If you are okay with this and will not try to break things, you will enjoy it.

edit: we need more shrooms"

1609650969,"The game is amazing, and the story was incredible. Definitely worth the time as is, but could also use a few more bug fixes. Will play again!"
1609650896,"If you like RPG or you like witcher 3
you will like this game too (need good spec PC tho)
or you can wait a few months or a year for more polished game, bugs and glitches everywhere but won't effect your game"
1609650760,"So much to do in the game. Yes it has it's bugs, and some of them can be very annoying like when it stops you from progressing in a mission and have to reload. But when you look past that, you've got a very alive open world with tons to do along a great storyline to follow. Definitely recomend."
1609650632,"If you can get past the audio glitches, this is one of the best story driven games in this decade. I honestly hope people can see the amazing story in how its built. This was hands down an ambitious project and will change how we view games in the future. I hate how such a great game can get such a bad rap so quick without it being out very long. I hope this helps the serious gamer. Its worth the money, for what it is."

Im sad.. what a great game this could have been."

Game still has a few glitches, but well worth the money.  Enjoyed the battle system, collectibles, and the quantity of missions.  The story line was very well written and the side plots did a great job of connecting to the main plot.  The movement was superb.  Will play it more than once.

No new game plus at the moment, but supposedly that may be in the works.  Highly recommended"
1609649786,This game was really awesome. Story was good and I finished my first play through in around 60 hours but I skipped a lot of side quests. There were a few bugs but I didn't find them to be a huge problem.
1609649717,"not what all the trailers promised, or what the devs promised, dont get me wrong its a fun game but just a closed box replica of what an ""RPG"" should be"
1609649681,"honestly this game is filled with bugs that are annoying, it has a big ol wall of illusion of choice, and the gun gameplay is boring at times.

but the story, characters, and honestly Night City itself kept me hooked. also doing a melee build with some gun gameplay made the playthrough really fun!

i would reccomend the game for others as i believe CDPR will release updates to fix issues and will create great new content"
1609649672,nah
1609649648,"This game has one of the greatest story lines of literally anything ever created (in my opinion), however you will not be able to truly appreciate how good it is until the game has major updates and constant bugs do not ruin the experience. Otherwise, feelings of rage and annoyance will take the place of what should be the appreciation of a life changing game. 

Basically, stay away from story spoilers until this game is fixed of its many bugs and performance issues. You may have a ""good"" experience playing the story now, but what it should be is a truly outstanding one. Do not spoil the experience for yourself, like I did, by playing it in its current state!"
1609649606,"if you like games like fallout 3 or watch dogs, you will enjoy this game. despite all of the bugs and glitches, i would rate this game a 10/10 experience. overall i would recommend this game as the story is just amazing and interesting."
1609649569,"This is a good game but it needs to get some things ironed out, over all i do recommend it but there are some little speed bumps here and there so be prepared i guess. over all probably a 8.5/10"
1609649549,"Ive played this game for about 40 hours and I haven’t even gotten that far in the game’s main story there is a lot of content. I think the game is great but I’ve got to say it’s a little unrealistic I mean even for the setting. The unrealism Is really the only bad part, in this world is very normal to get body enhancements actually it’s more regular then being completely natural so with this knowledge no way your character should be able to romance girls with an all natural chode instead of some guys 9 inch multipurpose leg hose."
1609649955,"I ran this game on my TI-84 Color and It looked beautiful. All bugs were intended by the developers as art and add to the experience. I don't understand what these people are saying about bad graphics. Maybe it's because they are still using a TI-83 plus???

My enjoyment of this game increased with an exponential trend rather than the stinky sub-linear logarithmic that GTA had. 

I give this game a perfect score of 5/7. no complaints. If you don't like this game its because you probably forgot that you left your machine on RAD mode instead of DEC."
1609649428,"The game is very glitchy and buggy in its current state, however there is a lot of potential in this game. The side quests and gigs are well crafted with more depth than most games. The game world is interesting but requires more time for the developers to finish making the game. 

I enjoyed the voice acting from the main character ""V"" and most of the side characters you meet are well voiced with depth to their personality.

However, the game has poor performance even on high-end system, the AI for NPCs and traffic is terrible with very poor path finding with the traffic, they are numerous bugs & glitches and some unfinished content on some missions.

I had fun with the game and still do, but I cannot recommend anyone to buy this game in its current state, unless you are truly okay with the issues at present."
1609649404,"This game is hands down just fun, the atmosphere and theme of the game is really what draws you in, also the interiors of cars. I found ""The World"" ending pretty sub-par but am yet to clock the rest of them, unfortunately this game comes with many downsides, honestly don't buy this game if you're expecting perfection because it is far from it, however, I only encountered 4 game restarting/crashing bugs throughout my whole 51 or so hour play-through, the rest of the bugs I encountered reminded me of FO:NV on release and simply made me laugh, and actually brought me some joy. However when you buy a game for 99 bucks you always look for a silver lining my g....."
1609649376,"This game sits at a very interesting place in my heart because as much as I can go on about the things I love, there are at least twice as many things I dislike that just nearly eclipses my likes for this game. And yet I have still enjoyed the game and don't feel ripped off for paying 60 dollars. You definitely get your mileage, hard to feel bad when I played for nearly 40 hrs and plan on playing more. However, I can not recommend this game to a buyer of any interest. This game's issues have been written about ,ad nauseum, so there's really no point expounding on the litany of shit you absolutely will deal with playing this game. Don't buy it, wait 6 months to a year and see if the patches and free dlc fix enough shit to make it worth while. Even than, just buy it on sale."

My game ran fine without any major bugs from start till end of the story. 

Storyline, Graphics, Gameplay, Weapons, Character were very good.

My first „end“ was „Where is my Mind“ but I’m going for the other 4 endings at the Moment.

Actually a decent ending but sadly you cannot continue playing after the HQ like for example with GTA V ..

I didn't encounter any bad glitches and my PC is strong enough to run it very well so I don't have any negative bias in that regard like some people might. Yeah the various NPC's AI sucked ass but whatever.
The visuals are great, the characters are great, the gameplay is fine, but the combat...
The combat is boring after you get overpowered weapons, I literally never used quick hacking or stealth (unless I absolutely had to), it was always just easier to shoot my way through the enemy than to waste my time with it, especially once I got one shot weapons.
I took my time with this game and did all the sidequests that I was interested in, depending on the character it had to do with.  Johnny's story, Panam's story ;), River's story (not homo tho, panam the only way), and a good few others.  
All in all a really solid game.  The state of the game at launch for low end PCs and consoles was unexcusable though.

The storyline is all over the place despite having different endings and paths,sadly it all relatively 'feels' the same. gameplay however is where this game shines, as combat you are given complete control over how you want to approach every situation. still working on maxing out my character, as that is the true endgame of cyberpunk 2077. great for RPG aspects, bad for plot."
1609648698,"Its futuristic GTA5. I really enjoyed a game that truly is made for an adult audience. I liked the story and even though it might have been shorter than expected I was still able to put 80+hrs in my first playthrough and had not done 100%. I expect DLC could also add to this a lot when it eventually comes, especially if its on par with the Witcher 3 DLC. I wouldnt recommend without a serious GPU preferably one with DLSS.

1609648428,it's really fun but you will have at least 1 bug every mission
1609648324,"BIG CAVEAT FOR THOSE WHO DON'T LIKE READING: While Cyberpunk 2077 is definitely a good game (like a solid 7/10), do not buy yet if you are not willing to deal with poor optimization, character builds that are broken by incorrectly implemented perks and features, and frequent minor and occasionally quest-breaking bugs.  

That said, I'm 90+ hours into this game, have completely the main story once after about 70 hours and started a second playthrough.  Main playthrough was as a time-slowing, bullet-dodging, katana-wielding Corpo madman, second playthrough as a Nomad hacker lady who calmly kills targets through walls half a mile away (exaggerating, but you get my point).  So let it not be said that there's no build diversity in Cyberpunk 2077.  That, besides the absolutely gorgeous design of Night City, may be the game's strongest point.

The weakest, apart from the issues listed at the top, is the story.  Simply put, it's toothless, which is about the most scathing critique you can make of a story in the cyberpunk genre.  The problem is that the scale of this game far exceeded CDPR's ability to implement it, and as a result I can't really tell what the ""point"" of the story is.  Are you supposed to be an anarchist firebrand, striking a blow against the corporations controlling the people of Night City?  Or are you supposed to be an opportunist, taking what you need while stepping on those weaker than you?  Or is your goal simply to survive this den of vices and escape to the wide open plains, equally desolate but at the very least more free?

CDPR never get around to making any of these messages hit home.  The best they do is offer players the ability to make one of three (or four, if you meet certain criteria for a hidden ending) choices as to how the game ends.  These are barely better than the non-decision at the end of Mass Effect 3 if only because they lead to unique final quests, which in turn have their own choices between two final, final paths, but their failed by the lack of clear themes and motivations up until this point.  V is the quintessential player-insert character, without strong opinions of their own save for what the player chooses for them to do.  The problem is that you are rarely given opportunities to define who V is over the course of a playthrough.  Many missions play out the same, as you have no major decisions available to alter their outcome, and in those quests where you are allowed to significantly alter the trajectory of events those choices say almost nothing about who your V is, what their morals and boundaries are, and how they relate to Night City and its other inhabitants.

Maybe having the quest be focused purely on bodily survival was the problem.  But there are plenty of other stories that make how the protagonist chooses to survive, and what concessions they're willing to make to their humanity and self-image, a bigger and more integral part.  See just about any entry in the zombie apocalypse genre, or even other dystopian sci-fi tales for examples.  No, unfortunately I think that in the pursuit of gameplay and worldbuilding scale CDPR just didn't have time to flesh out the story in the same way as past efforts.

Other issues, to list a few: the lack of introduction to enemy factions (relying on players to look them up in a Database that is tucked off in a corner of the pause screen as if in shame), the lack of distinction between enemy factions (in gameplay mechanics, though in looks they are very well defined), the difficulty curve (a sheer cliff in the early hours, but like tissue paper by about level 20 if you've planned your build well), and driving (hope you enjoy the feeling of ice physics!)

Ultimately, I really hope that this game sees many, many updates, because it needs them.  But sadly no amount of updates will be able to fix the story issues at this game's core.  Cyperpunk 2077 is ultimately like the city where it is set: visually beautiful, fast paced and exciting, but with little in its soul in terms of real meaning or emotion."
1609648286,"best game i've played in along time i hope they add a lot more in a later date

1609648224,"Some may call this junk. Me, I call them treasures."
1609648211,Great Game!! Glitches makes it even better!  20/20
1609648155,"This game is a masterpiece, a work of art. Nothing so expansive, intricate or rich exists on any level as this game. Many people have made negative comments about this game but given the scope of this game a few glitches can be forgiven. The level of detail and the richness of the story line are what make this an immersive experience. There have been times where I've missed being in Night City.

It truly is an experience, not just some game. CDPR has outdone themselves here.

Comparisons to the witcher 3 are inappropriate. Even though there are similarities in the way quests are set up and inventory handles, they have made many changes to improve the user experience and crafting options.

I really hope that they have some massive DLCs for this because I would really like to find out what happens to some of the story lines that were left incomplete."
1609648129,Love it
1609647966,real noice. nuf sed
1609647937,"Still impressive graphics, even with all the glitches. Fun and addictive to play"
1609647935,"Game redeemed itself near end. Story is very good, gameplay is decent and once bugs are fixed the game will be very good, but not amazing."
1609647920,"Bought it today. Game crashes after character creation. Now it won't even start. Met system requirements and reinstalling doesn't help. Looking for a refund now but posting here to warn others.

CPU Intel 19-9900KF
GPU GeForce GTX 2080 Super
RAM 48 GB

Drivers and OS up to date, running Win 10"
1609647854,Great!
1609647778,"Firstly, let's address the issue of bugs. I have been lucky and have experienced only one major bug, and the frequency of the minor bugs - most of which are of a graphical nature - have reduced considerably as patches have come out. Be warned though - the updates for this game are huge.
Most of the bugs I have encountered have been very minor - things like pop in (or out) of vehicles, and concessional glitches regarding NPCs holding objects (apparently the world of Night City allows people to smoke mobile phones). I encountered one major bug where a side mission failed to recognise that it was completed, preventing saving and required starting the whole mission again.
I have experienced one crash with the game, however everything on my computer crashed as well, so it's possible that something else was to blame there.

Now for the good parts - this game really does allow a lot of player freedom. Seemingly innocuous choices early on can affect how the entire game plays out. The city itself really does seem like an actual dystopian city complete with clear evidence of environmental failings. I've completed the main story after 55 hours of game play, but have yet to do the vast majority of open world jobs and side missions, so you are certainly getting value for your money in terms of pounds per hour!

One final point to address - some people have been complaining that the police are very over-zealous if you commit a crime. Perhaps these people are seeing the world of Night City as being like GTA, whereas perhaps the game is actually trying to encourage you not to break the law - like not to mow down civilians - or cops.

For reference, here are my specs (1080p - everything at max):
CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X @ 4.25 GHz
GPU: AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT with 8 GB GDDR6 RAM
RAM: 16 GB DDR4-3200 (1600 MHz)
Storage: 500 GB M.2 SSD for the game (I found that the issue of pop-in was much worse on an HDD), and 5 TB JBOD array for OS

This config runs the game at 1080p with no frame drops"
1609647707,"W.O.W 
waiting more stories"
1609647705,"Little buggy but honestly doesnt take away from the fun, story is great with plenty of map to explore."
1609647625,"This game may have had its hiccups, a lot I'll admit, but over time it grows on you. It has depth and sure, it can be pretty shallow in AI responses, they're dumb; but it's a solid game. The main story is thought provoking in moments, the choices are broad and the quick time prompts aren't too fast, which is good, but it gives you the sense of choice. It may not be completely apparent at the time, but from playing all the backgrounds on Steam (corpo) Stadia (Streetkid) and XSX (Nomad), they do make an impact. This game is amazing, visually stunning and maybe not completely game changing and revolutionary, but it has a grasp on me. Character arcs are phenomenal, the experience of going different places is solid and some missions can be redundant. Shoot, kill, search or plant (virus or something), with more shooting. It's not perfect and I am not saying it is, but with well over 130+hrs over 3 platforms, its a solid freaking game."
1609647548,"If I could refund the game my self, I'd do it. 

The game has great overall graphics, But thats not problem here.

The Story itself is rather bland,  and I feel like they lied about a lot of the gameplay

The endings are boring, and the core combat feels like GTA, with no Jeff Jakerson, great person!

But for real tho serious talk fellas on that Reddit r/thisisfrfrfr420xD this stuff, isn't all that great, again the graphics are cool, but the game that's driven on story sure doesnt have all that good of a sotry"
1609647495,Very good
1609647452,"This is a good game BUT, there are still some issues that need ironed out.  Some bugs don't mess with the gameplay and are even funny sometimes (if your aren't worried about losing immersion) but there are a few that can be irritating, like music overlapping and icons freezing onto your screen.  The optimization is also quite poor and can make your frames tank in certain scenarios.  However, other than that, fun game.  Great storytelling, character arcs, and world building.  The side quests are where this game really shines.  If the bugs and optimization can be fixed in the upcoming months, this will be remembered as a fantastic game."
1609647299,"Brief but accurate review

-its ok i spose, is it anything ground breaking?.. not really..

-Price tag?.. $90 AU, overpriced for what you receive.

-is it a game to remember?.. not for anything good.

-does it have replay value?.. ehh.. maybe once if you liked it the first time.

-Story gripping?.. mmmmildly

-Sexual content?.. i mean, its over the top... you can tell that 16 dudes were in a room together laughing while coming up with ways to overly sexualize everything. But its nothing pornographic (besides having a genitals option) again... does nothing to the gameplay, so why even?

-was it overhyped?.. absolutely

-what about the graphics?.. pretty fair, if you have the PC for it, but nothing new

-how about the physics engine?.. errr, lets just say they were completely NOT ready, buggy and glitchy, but its again, not the worst.

-would you recommend this game?.. I would give it about 1 year, let them figure out a few things, clear the bugs, tweak it. Then wait for a Steam Sale... at that point, the game will be worth it for the price tag of. $49 and no more, but could be less if possible.

ALL in ALL:  6.5 / 10   (but the future could change) anything above 6 is a thumbs up

Review date: 3/01/2021"
1609650685,"If you play it for what it is, it's a good game (not minding the bugs). [b]Night City, soundtrack and characters are all beautiful and memorable. But,[/b]

-Most of the things they promised are not in the game, even the ones they showed weeks before the release. [b]The game has too much cut content[/b] (both mechanics and storywise) that one can realize without seeing the trailers/demos beforehand. For more details: https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kcve8s/promised_but_missing_feature_list_will_update/ (not my post)

-It has many bugs, balance issues, and a [b]non-existent AI[/b] for driving, pedestrians, and police (you would think it was from a test build of the game and the devs forgot to add the real thing).  

-In combat, it seems like the [b]game doesn't even try to make you take different approaches[/b]. That is mostly because of the dumb enemy AI which doesn't try to flank you or take cover. They only shoot, walk sideways, or sometimes get stuck behind a box while dashing towards you. As a netrunner, you can get behind cover and spam your hacks till everyone is neutralized and the enemy wouldn't be able to do anything effective to counter this.

-Killing or not, it doesn't make any difference. The gangs do not react to your actions (things like sending men after you in the streets, not letting you in their turf, etc.). [b]There are no random encounters[/b], just specific located events/gigs that you choose to go for. Do you remember the dangerous Pacifica that you need an armored car to travel through? You can walk free of danger just by staying away a couple of meters from predefined events on the map. [b]Nobody comes for you, you go for them.[/b]

-There is no meaningful fame system in a game one tries to be ""the legend"" of Night City. Street Cred is just a level system exclusively for unlocking new items at vendors. [b]Nobody reacts to your Street Cred.[/b]

-Lifepaths only give you extra flavor dialog options that change nothing other than just one or two encounters.

-The only choices that matter is the ones you make at the end of the game. Every other endgame variable is determined by whether doing or not doing the linear side-quests. [b]Every playthrough is the same till the last mission.[/b]

I'll cut it here.

As said before, Cyberpunk 2077 is a good game if you play it for what it is, not for the false promises made by CDPR. I enjoyed my playthrough and looking forward to expansions. But [u][b]this game does not deserve a recommendation or any awards at all because of all the false promises and the ""not ready"" state of the game at launch.[/b][/u]"
1609647139,"pros: (written during hotfix 1.06)
- Immersive

cons:
- plethora of bugs"
1609647088,"Definitely launch day bugs, but like The Witcher CDPR will patch and update this for years to come.  Lot of fun so far, I can't say the same for Rockstar games like GTA or RDR2"
1609647080,Some visual glitches and vocal glitches but overall I really enjoy playing this
1609647071,On a top end computer don't have any problems.
1609647024,Good focus on story (main and side missions) but might be a weaker shooter than expected.

1609646961,"Loving the story line so far, and a great game overall. Sadly, not without it's fair share of bugs."
1609646850,"If you get over all the bugs it's a great game. Personally I have not experienced anything game breaking, just some minor audio and movement glitches. The story is one of the best I have played in a long time. My only gripe is that the game launched without a lot of promised/shown features. Hopefully the devs keep working on it similar to No Mans Sky.

For anyone feeling that the movement is kinda glitchy I would highly recommend following this guide.

1609646778,"Don't really understand or care why everyone says this game sucks. Sure, it has some bugs here and there but nothing game breaking. Pretty good game. 8/10"
1609646607,"very good
"
1609646591,"Highly immersive, addictive and fun! Also it has a great Soundtrack and it's an unmatched cyberpunk experience in videogame format. Found a couple of bugs but nothing that I couldn't get arround. Highly recommend for fans of the cyberpunk genre.

1609646395,Despite the issues many have faced... on my machine had no critical issues. Worth my 65 bux and getting close to 100 hrs
1609646302,"Story is great , Decision driven and has plenty of options, character customization is great. The major detractor is glaring glitches throughout."
1609646298,"So ive logged over a 100 hours of one playthrough most side missions and the opening for all three lifepaths and i can say that this game is unpolished, but still quite impressive.

Gameplay 9/10 so many playstyles and builds and not one feels way better than the other

graphics 8/10 for the mostpart it is breathtaking, but the glitches into peoples faces sometime ruin th looks and atmosphere.

Story: 9/10 boy do i feel for every character in this game even if i didnt side with them each one was compelling and engaging.

Difficulty: 7/10 this game isnt made to break you and a good build and proper weapons made some fights range from laughably easy, to a somewhat challage. Yet until you get to the endgame there will be things you aviod. Yet if you stick it out i finished at lvl 43 and i felt like a god amoung men osmetimes.

overal 8.5/10 except for some emersion breaking issues and wierd glitches this is still in my top 10 best games of the year easy.


 Most of the glitches i encountered were annoying, but not game breaking. I did have one jumping over a fence where i fell out the map and had to restart a whole mission. Let me say that despite its faults i would rate this one of the more engaging gamesi played this year. Once the kinks are worked out it will be phenominal just like the witcher games. The characters feel very organic and the stories are compelling. This is a game where the side stories make the game and it feels like everyone has there own story. I can't wait to see what dlc comes from this and how they improve on this but i am still a huge fan of CD project red and the work they are doing."
1609646287,no game lives up to its hype.
1609646260,"One of the best games I've ever played, nails story, gameplay, and graphics. Games like this demonstrate the superiority of PC gaming, and it has been a long time since I've played anything this outstanding."
1609646211,"I think commentary is way too harsh, after playing 20 hours, i have to say that this world is really interesting. There are things to improve, but they are minor details... Easy to improve and I'm sure they will. 

I advise to play around with graphic settings a bit until you've got the best ones for your PC!"
1609646565,"So many bugs, waste my money buy early release... If u want buy this game wait for discount it will be worth it"
1609646188,Not worth it yet. I have quite a few hours in here enjoying the good writing for the main story but there are so many bugs and at least a few crashes. It needs quite a bit of patching but it does indeed have great potential.
1609646134,Good story line
1609646048,"This positive review comes with a few disclaimers;

1. You need decent hardware - at time of writing - to run this game well;
My current Build is i7 10700k, RTX 3080, 32GB 3200Mhz DDR4 Ram, Loaded on an NVMe SSD

2. Yes there are bugs in the game currently, if this is an issue for your immersion, don't play the game until it is fixed, if you are happy enough to play with some bugs this game is fine.

I started playing Cyberpunk with the knowledge that it was loaded with issues/bugs and actually only had a GTX 1070 in my PC when I started playing, was getting roughly 40-60 frames at low settings and the game was still fairly playable, quality on the low settings isn't the worst you can imagine.

After upgrading to an RTX 3080 I've hit stable ~60-70 fps including gunfights and cinematic areas at 1440p resolution (DLSS Quality, Ray tracing on). Which was actually really good, didn't incur many issues or crazy game breaking bugs (except for one side mission issue).

Cyberpunk 2077 Overall, for me, was a very enjoyable game from an RPG perspective. It has great story-telling, a rather large abundance of characters, dialogue and choice based options. The endings to the story were very heartfelt from my perspective.

In regards to being a looter/shooter, this game is no borderlands 3, but there is a fairly large arsenal of weaponry, mods and customisation within the combat scene itself - adding in also the options to class out in different areas with cybernetics, or weaponry or even just being a basic brute and punching your way through the game - there is a heap of options that won't disappoint.

I believe CDPR will come through with bug fixes for this game fairly soon, I don't believe the state of the game will remain as it is - after-all, the critically acclaimed Witcher 3 didn't start out as the pearl of perfection it is now (same studio in case you aren't aware yet) - it was buggy, had issues and not as much content as it currently has. I have big faith that the bugginess/content will be improved on if you're worried about the game being stagnant in the state it's in.

I only occured a few minor bugs where animations sometimes were a little weird **SPOILER ALERT** (mostly sex scenes). The only major bug I came across was one where it wouldn't allow me to complete a side gig that was complete but still in the list. Still able to finish the game (not sure if 100% due to quest bug) as much as I could and play all the endings.

Very happy with my purchase personally and is one of the better games to come out of 2020. There are a few things that could be improved on in terms of the bugs/animation issues, but overall I believe as long as you have the hardware to support at high/ultra settings; this game is extremely immersive and does very well."
1609645876,"Game gets a bad rep for its bugs, but that is all on the Executives. If it just had more time it could have flourished. Very fun gameplay and build variety + amazing side quests gets you immersed quick."
1609645874,over hyped but still pretty good game. Just very buggy
1609645857,Every quest is the name of a song. 10/10.
1609645713,"Is it buggy.....yes. BUT, even with the bugs, this game is a ton of fun. I've really enjoyed it so far, and it's only going to get better and better. Worth the money in my opinion."
1609645679,"Broken and empty is how I would describe this game. First off the amount of bugs in the game is ridiculous. Thats obvious as soon as your first start playing. NPCs T pose, walk through walls, permanently become scared. Enemies glitch through walls, cops will fly side to side hitting you with incredible accuracy as they teleport all around you. The game is BROKE BROKE. But I could over look ALL of that if the game had any substance. Like legitmately I do not understand the people who make these ""Open World"" games and proceed to leave them LARGELY EMPTY. You get no rewards or interesting tid bits from exploring the city. MOST of the doors do not even open to the city. I walked around for a solid hour trying doors looking for something interesting but half the time you just run into a group of bad guys (no idea why theyre hostile to you) and then they proceed to shoot you. I really wish game developers would take a second to add a little depth to their worlds before they slap a 60 dollar price tag on a BLOATED EMPTY VISUAL NOVEL. Because thats how this game plays. The side quests and all the other garbage are so surface level and boring that 90% of the time I skip through the dialog. Also quick side note. The female characters voice is terrible. I wish we had a silent protagonist or at the very least just leave their voice out entirely like Fallout NV or Kotor. Anyways. Don't buy this game till its like 20 bucks or something. its not worth the money and honestly its pretty weak overall. Id rather play through fallout NV or skyrim again than do multiple play throughs of this steaming pile of let down."
1609645646,"Awesome game! Obviously not perfect out the gate but as long as they keep supporting and fixing it, it'll be a masterpiece soon."
1609645472,"Don't know why people were giving this game some much shit, for developers that haven't made a game like this they have done fairly well especially when they were forced to release it by there fans. Sure there are bugs but every game has bugs."
1609645284,I have no concept of time while I play. I constantly feel the need to grow stronger Skyrim style but with better pacing.
1609645221,fun game. the glitches are hilarious XD
1609645212,"This game is full of broken promises but just so fun to play. The environmental design is top notch. It all starts to fall downhill from there. The graphics are great but clearly optimized for ray tracing. I run a 1080 ti and there is a bit of noise in the reflections. Hopefully this gets addressed in later patches after they are done cleaning up the console train wreck. 

What I mean by environmental design being topnotch I am referring to the visuals. As far as environmental gameplay goes, run from one mission to the next. Pick whatever flavor you desire in the moment. If their marketing campaign would have been more honest or had the game delivered on the promises made, this would be an incredible experience. But, this game instead falls on the same level as ubisoft games. Run around the world, see people walking, clear an area of enemies and do unique quests until they run out. There is only so much a developer can do with an open world game at this point. I really thought CDPR would be the ones to push the envelope, but instead they played it safe."
1609645186,Been loving it... even with the twitches.
1609645144,"I really enjoyed the attention to detail the game brings. Its incredibly immersive for me, didn't encounter bugs or glitches that ruined any experience. Built a fun world to interact and explore in, great impacting story as well."
1609644955,"Best RPG I have ever played until it deleted both of my game saves. I lost 10 hours of progress AFTER they released a patch fixing game save bugs, when before I never had an issue. Then my girlfriend's save gets deleted completely and she has to start all the way from the beginning lost about 50 hours of playing."
1609973188,"8/10
Fix AI, bugs and performance issues and it will be 10/10."

Dumbass Console people need to stop complaining and get a PC."
1609644780,Very detailed. Be patient. Run some side gigs. Go to the ripperdoc for enhancements.
1609644728,"The entire game from start to finish is full of glitches. I Love It! Like many of my favourite games this game is so bugged out you can skip entire sections, one shot enemies, buy/build anything you will ever need! if that's not your thing dont worry about it! you may stumble upon a glitch but its your choice to use and abuse it ;)

1609644585,Best game ever made. I literally had to uninstall it to be productive in my life again. 10/10
1609644578,"GRAPHICS:

❌  Atari 2600
❌  Very bad
❌  Average
✅ Beautiful
❌ That was a game?

The open world is one of the most beautiful open worlds I've ever seen, but the animations... they haven't improved since Witcher 3. The game also contains a lot of graphic bugs.


SOUND:

❌ My ears are bleeding
❌ Ok
❌ Good
❌ Godlike
✅ A new Nirvana album


DIFFICULTY:

❌ Everyone could beat this game 
❌ Easy
✅ Normal 
❌ Hard
❌ Impossible

The game is unbalanced. I ran into some bossfights and killed them with 3 Auto pump shots and other bossfights are harder then many dark souls bosses.


STORY:

❌ It hasn’t a story at all
❌ Pretty disappointing
❌ Forgettable 
❌ I like it
✅ Masterpiece

A well written story. It isn’t on the same level like Witcher 3, but it’s great. 


GAMEPLAY:
❌ Big Rigs
❌ I don’t like it
✅ Ok
❌ Above average
❌ I’ve never had more fun playing a game

The game is something like a watch dogs, but more. The gameplay in general is fun, but the bugs and balancing problems ruin it sometimes. Another bad thing is if you wanna explore and make things outside the main and sidequest you will be disappointed, because the openworld is very empty. 


PRICE:

❌ Free to play
❌ To cheap
✅ Normal price
❌ Overpriced
❌ You can also burn your money


REQUIREMENTS:

❌ You can run it on a toaster
❌ Intel HD is enough
❌ Mid-end
✅ High-end 
❌ ""NASA"" computer

I played it on a GTX 1660s and a r5 2600. I could play it on high settings with round about 60fps with frame drops 


LENGTH:

❌ Very short (0 - 3 hours)
❌ Short (3 - 15 hours)
✅ Normal (15 - 50 hours)
✅ Long (> 50 hours)
❌ Infinite

How long to beat says:
Main Story: 20 hours
Main + Extra: 51 hours
Completionist: 87 hours


CONCLUSION
It’s a game for people, who wanna play a linear story focused RPG. It’s a 9/10 if they fix the bugs, but now it’s a 7/10 for me. I wouldn’t recommend you to buy it now. Wait until the bugs are fixed.
Ps. Excuse me for my bad english I'm german and that is my first review in english"
1609644427,Most of the negative reviews are over-blown complaints. The game is hella fun.
1609644397,I believe it was one of the best gaming experiences in my life. Thank You CDPR!
1609644360,Honestly one of the worst endings to a game ever.
1609644331,"Since the update my game crashes, and yes i've updated my drivers."
1609644248,"Some bugs here and there. Heavily outweighed by how fun it is. Having a blast, pun intended."

1609644003,"Compare to GTA5, it has many new gameplay, items, and details"
1609643794,"It's really good, don't talk to me I'm busy."
1609643787,"Buggiest game I've ever played, but still enjoyable. Has lots of potential."
1609643698,"I am deeply disappointed in CDPR. They hyped up the game so much, and after working on it for near a decade and previously having created the masterpiece that is The Witcher 3, they STILL managed to fuck it up beyond mortal comprehension. 

I have played only 20 hours, and have dozens of saved clips of the game breaking, crashing, or just outright falling apart at the seams. The AI can only be described as lobotomised, the physics engine is a joke, the open world is a beautiful but bland experience, and the controls are a sick joke. Seriously, double tapping WASD to dash?!?! I cannot count how many times i've unintentionally dashed past a cop, whom for some ungodly reason took personal my acrobatics attempt, and summoned his teleporting ninja-cop-buddies to kick my ass into the next elder scrolls game. 

I extended my hand in friendship, and CDPR spat in my mouth. Will be seeking a refund."
1609643977,I like this game. It is Fun. I have FUn Playing THIS game. I am still having fun SHOOTING. I do not like driving. The mini map sucks its so ZOOMED IN WHY IS IT SO ZOOMED IN I CANT SEE ANYTHING WHILE IM DRIVING WHICH I AM DOING 99% OF THIS GAME BUT I KEEP CRASHING INTO WALLS OR OVERSHOOTING A TURN ITS THE WORST THING ABOUT THIS GAME ALSO ONLY 4 LOVE INTERESTS? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? AND HALF ARE GENDER LOCKED. MAKE THEM ALL BI WHO CARES ABOUT PREFERENCE LET ME DECIDE WHO I WANT TO KISS I AM LEVEL 20 COOL AND I AM NOT COOL ENOUGH TO KISS MARRY HAVE BABIES WITH ANYONE I CHOOSE? ALSO I CANT CHANGE MY HAIRSTYLE OR FACIAL FEATURES IN A GAME WHERE EVERYONE IS CONSTANTLY DOING THAT? WHERE ARE THE BARBERS? AND POLICE SPAWNING OUT OF NO WHERE? WHY WHY WHY WHY ITS NOT FUN THATS NOT FUN ITS STUPID AND BREAKS ANY SEMBLANCE OF IMMERSION ITS JUST DUMB. I STILL DONT UNDERSTAND WHY I CANT CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT MY CHARACTERS BESIDES THE CLOTHES I WEAR. CANT EVEN CHANGE THE FINGERNAIL PAINT. ALSO NO POLICE CHASES? THERE ARE POLICE CARS EVERYWHERE BUT NONE ACTUALLY CHASE YOU WHEN YOU COMMIT A CRIME? ACTUALLY I DONT THERE THIS ARE MANY CAR CHASES AT ALL THAT HAPPEN IN THIS GAME. WHY? Besides that the game is fun just missing small features and needing a few tweaks that would make this game infinitely better. Don't even try to sell DLC in the future. Free updates for the sh*t in the base game that are irritating. Feel like no one actually QA tested this game. Still fun doe.
1609643627,"A game that had a lot of potential, but unfortunately lived up to none of it. It's buggy, incomplete, and is nowhere near the game that was advertised and promised to us years ago... I could go into more detail, but the bottom line is that CDPR lied, and this game is not worth your time or your money."
1609643574,"Keanu Reeves says ""Impressive Cock"""
1609643554,77/20 would punk again
1609643484,"No matter the bad release, the devs pulled off a great game, a ton of bugs yes, but frame rates and graphics look amazing on my new build!"
1609643442,"Aside from all the sh*t it takes, actually a great game on pc. A few bugs here and there but it's a new game so it's expected. Overall solid, just pls let me do a wheelie on the bikes :("
1609643325,I was expecting much more in terms of the city itself. But after getting use to the gameplay I can't deny that i'm having a lot of fun with the game.
1609643289,i love this game so dam much best 60$ ive ever spent.
1609643267,slapps so much if you got a beast pc that you won't be playing much else for awhile
1609925737,Brilliant game bogged down by save-breaking bugs. My review will keep being negative until future patches change things
1609643234,"The bugs and bad AI are not the game's only problem. The story has a lot of plot holes and the game has pretty much no lore. Choices were hyped up to matter a lot in the game but they only seem to matter in the final mission. The life paths don't matter at all except for 10 min at the beginning of the game and a few dialogue options, however, the life paths were advertised to seem like each one would change the game completely."
1609643440,"Not exactly a yes but not exactly a no either

Apart from bugs and other infamous things you can actually do fun things like hitting people with sexual toy C:
Tons of great side content, very mediocre main story though and choices impact lesser than you think

Great for a game that was released 57 years earlier than it was supposed to ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
1609643164,I got them gorilla grip arms... enough said.
1609643140,Keanu Reeves is my daddy ♥
1609643132,Great story and fun game play. less bugs than expected
1609643108,"//Disclaimer I played this game on an i9-9900KF and an RTX 2080 SUPER installed on a very fast m.2 drive I cannot speak for the experience of playing it on lower end hardware only what I have experienced on my computer//

I have held off on making this review for almost a month since the games launch to allow myself to make a fair and accurate review of this game and if you should buy it or not. Without falling into the trap of comparing it to everyone's ridiculously over the top expectations from the server amounts of overhyping the game received or just jumping straight to the defence of CDPR solely because they are one of my favourite game devs.

In short yes i believe you should buy this game it has got yes a lot of bugs but behind all that is a very compelling main story and some of the best side quest design i have seen in any game since the witcher 3.

Pros of this game:
- Stunning graphics (if you have the computer to run them on)
- Great main quest line
- AMAZING SIDE QUEST DESIGN
- Literally god tier soundtrack
- Amazing voice acting
- Extremely immersive
- Genuinely likeable characters
- Genuinely fun melee 
- Very good character creation
- The devs have already promised a long roadmap of free DLC content and Updates / Bug fixes

Cons:
- EXTREMELY BUGGY: i'm not just talking your run of the mill funny or visial bugs or glitches you get regular game breaking bugs that you have to quit to the main menu and open a save to fix on top of a GIANT heap of  visual and silly bugs that sometimes are a bit of a laugh but most of the time ruin immersion and tread all over otherwise impactful moments in the story literally the worst part of this game

- Life path system is not as important as it was sold to us: When this game was announced it was seemingly made clear that the lifepath system would play a big role in your options as a player however in actuality it only really lets you play one of three opening missions before putting you right back in where every other lifepath leads you as well as influencing the armour and weapon you start with and giving you a few unique dialogue options during the story as far as i can tell the dialogue options only let you have some select small talk with some characters and while this can add to your immersion as far as i can tell it adds literally nothing to your ending possibilities and to any real gameplay.

- The stealth system is very boring: Seriously if you are going to play this game especially for the first time stay far away from the stealth system its just not very fun and gets extremely janky at times.

- Gunplay not as amazing as promised: Honestly most of the criticism this games gunplay gets is in my quite unwaranted its actually alright and the inclusion of Tech, Smart and Power Guns really does spice it up a little all in all its not bad its just not as good as we were promised.

-Loot often feels bland or copy pasted: While some of the unique items in the game are actually very cool looking and the upgrade system lets them stay mechanically viable for much longer than usually in games like this most of the guns/armour you loot is all textured the same just with minor stat changes there seems to be a few different models for each category of gun e.g. Tech, SMG, Assault Rifle Etc ... which get randomly used on guns with pregenerated stats on them which is disapointing considering the game was sold as having in depth gun customisation and loot mechanics

Conclusion:
All in all it is what i would consider a very above average game at its core which is buried below a pile of bugs and hype. Its got a great story and mechanically plays quite well not to mention the secondary features like soundtrack and voice acting which are just impeccable. The game was severely overhyped and failed to live up to the expectations it set for itself which made a lot of people mad.

Should I buy it?:
It really depends if the story seems compelling to you pick it up now and play it the bugs are a problem but it's not absolutely unplayable as some people would have you believe. For everyone else I would recommend giving this game a pass for 6 or so months and picking it up when it has reduced in price or a significant amount of the problems with the game have been fixed and some of the free DLC has been released for the game giving you some new content to poke at! :))

Score: 
7.5/10"
1609643098,1
1609643086,Great game. Minor bugs here and there but nothing gamebreaking. 9/10 skye is the chick.
1609643069,"Its a great game and runs just fine on a Ryzen 7 3700X // Sapphire 5700XT with 32GB of 3600mhz RAM. Have played now ~40 hours and have had a couple glitches but nothing of note, a couple T-poses. Beautiful story and really into the world the developers created."
1609643031,"Well, after 112 hours I can say this game suuucks

up all your time because it's so good.

There's a lot of clearly missing content and some bugs (nothing major, crashy, or game breaking, just annoying) but it's really just a whole lot of fun even at this state. Everything here is really well acted and well written. You'll love the characters and the extremely detailed environments.

Pro tip: if you have an RTX card, upgrade to the latest Nvidia driver and play with DLSS and ray tracing on quality. The advantages of ray tracing are beautiful in this game, and DLSS smooths it out spectacularly."
1609642962,good game. need some fixes
1609642961,"This game is a mess. A very pretty, lovely, interesting but borderline unplayable mess."
1609642925,"huge disappointment for all the hype, and ive been anticipating this game release since  i heard about it a few years ago...but that said yes i  would recommend it"
1609642887,good
1609642694,Fun
1609642548,Absolutely loving it. 52 hours in and I'm around halfway done or so.
1609642526,Fantastic game with a great story. Needs some time to fix the bugs but nothing game breaking for me in my first play through.
1609642499,it's ok i guess.
1609642494,good game
1609642490,"Even with all the bugs, the beauty of this game is hard not to appreciate.  I can only imagine what this game is going to become in the next 6months to a year once everything has been patched and when the planned DLC comes out.  Give this game some time and you'll love it just as I did."
1609642480,"It's a fun game, kind of like mass effect or other story type games. Similiar to GTA sandbox

Playing on 2070 super and 3600x. Most of the time it runs fine, it does occasionally crash. I think most of the appeal to this game is graphics and pushing your system with ray tracing and experiencing that as well. 

If you're wanting to get lost in a story and look at beautiful graphics this is a good game. It's not skill based like cod or apex legends, it doesn't have that FPS feel either but those skills do translate here for headshots. 

I'd recommend buying it, i'm not disappointed i spent 60 bucks on it. I get roughly 43-55 fps @1440p psycho ray tracing and balanced dlss, 33-40ish with quality dlss setting."
1609642430,"not perfect, too much bug, missing a lot of content. this is an example of unfinished product, but still love this game"
1609642394,The game was made by a studio that wanted to f*** us over! Thanks a bunch [strike]EA[/strike] [strike]Ubisoft[/strike] CD Project Red
1609642310,"Fantastic game, I've run into a hand full of bugs while playing. Most have been simple visual glitches, and certianly no game breaking errors. Fantastic graphics mixed with striking story plot, and emersive world."
1609642280,Amazing
1609642189,"*Gnome Seal of Approval*
After reading other reviews (or should I say rants?), from what I understand, quite a bit of content and features are missing from the final game. I didn't really follow the development or the marketing of the game so my expectations were more neutral. That's why my review is about the final product and not about what we didn't get.

What we have here is a huge game with lots to explore. Both when it comes to missions and character development. I quite enjoyed the main story and how it ended. With one exception: Keanu Reeves. I didn't really mind his character, but rather his terrible performance and likeness in the game. Not a fan.

The game was thoroughly enjoyable for me! What I enjoyed the most was how much freedom you had developing your character's abilities. Most games restricts you into specializing a certain spec. Here you can specialize in several at the same time and combine them by the time you reach the level cap. For example; I chose to go heavy into Quickhacks, Handguns, Blades and Cold Blood. On top of that I had some extra help from Breach Protocol and Stealth.

That said, the game is not without issues (which you probably already know by now). My playthrough was plagued by graphical glitches. None of them game breaking, but they could ruin immersion for many players.
Once I had to reload an earlier save because my character wouldn't draw her weapons anymore after a longer cutscene. That was kind of annoying. Some features are also bugged (clothing mods comes to mind).

Before I started playing, I also had to read up on how to work around the key binding issues. But once I had that sorted, my playthough went pretty smooth and that game had me entertained for most of December.

Once the bugs and glitches are fixed, they have a solid game here. A solid game that could have been postponed for another few months of development to prevent the fanboi and media backlash."
1609642161,"fantastic game in all. i have only run in to minor glitches and none of them were game breaking they were just funny. im not on any kind of high end rig either i just meet their recommended setting pretty much. theres so much to do its crazy, 41 hours and i dont think ive barely hit half way of the story because i keep getting distracted by cool side stuff and doing side stuff with other plot characters. im not one to usually play through a game multiple times but im actually looking forward to playing through 2 more times with different life paths and totally different character builds to see what other cool stuff i can get in to. definatly worth picking this game up if you enjoy a really good rpg."
1609642131,The game crashes all the time it makes it really hard to play.  There's lot's of content as long as you play all the side quests and random stuff around the map but if all you play is main quest you'll finish super fast. Honestly it's a disappointment
1609642070,"fun game, can't wait for new patches to fix fps and bug issues"
1609642053,Loved it game never crashed for me weren't that as many glitches as i thought there would be. 9/10
1609642051,save file corrupted after 200+ hours. lmao f*ck me i guess
1609641993,"150 hours into the game, I've unlocked 3 endings through the Nomad path with no game-breaking bugs. Hilarious glitches, yes. Game-breaking, no. Some hiccups here and there but nothing a reload of last save won't fix.

As is with CDPR's previous successful game that was Witcher 3, the side-stories make the game. It'd feel empty and pretty ""Meh"" at best if you were to just plough through and do the main story. 

Ran on both 2060 and 1060Ti both with an i5, sans Ray-Tracing on the 1060 of course and 60FPS on Ultra with DLSS on Perfomance and a slight drop to 45-50 on Quality. Didn't affect my enjoyment of the game nonetheless. Maybe I'm just easily pleased. Either way, preem fun, Chooms. 

[spoiler]Finished the game and did all side gigs and not once did Johnny Silverhand told this Samurai to wake the f*ck up because we have a city to burn though. Douche move, CDPR. [/spoiler]"
1609641991,"Played the game from launch, experienced a few bugs but nothing game breaking. Patches fixed most problems i had but still there is room for improvement as the game still lacks polish. Since i am a completionist i finished all side missions and gigs and honestly never felt like a drag or nuisance as most games tend to become. The main story itself is about 20 hours long the rest much much more. Combat is fun, lots of weapons and stuff to try that could propably suit most styles. Not anything special but still better than most shooter rpgs out there. All in all i would rate this game a sold 7/10 and would reccomend it, i certainly got my moneys worth and will propably return to it when some expasions and further updates kick in."
1609641988,"It is a little broken, but this game is awesome. Just my $0.02."
1609641957,"The media annoyingly decided that this game was going to be their new year pinata. But speaking purely from what I've actually played, I absolutely love this game.

I've found there are far less bugs than your usual Bethesda game (a low bar, admittedly) - and nothing has been game breaking or caused more than a reload with a minute or two lost.

The game itself is really fun. The world is fantastic, with some elements being absolutely insanely well detailed and story driven. Dialogues tend to be quite good.

There's balance issues in some of the skills, and it definitely isn't that hard once you get the hang of it, but damn - I've had SO MUCH FUN. And hey, having fun is the aim - this is the best game I've played in a long time."
1609641947,smooth game play
1609641828,I loved this game
1609641793,"Beautiful game, needs A LOT of work to be done and it will be even better."
1609641782,This  game is very buggy. battlefield 4 story is better then this
1609641776,"100+ hours at the moment, only had one bug where i had to reload the save. Yeah it's buggy, but not nearly as most people make it to be. RPG mechanics are more simplified than i expected, but still good enough to make different builds. Crafting's the one thing i'm not a big fan of. It's good and all, just dont like the weird randomization that's going on. The combat's great (most fun i had with it was a ""double jump+smart SMG"" combo) and enemy AI's good (AI quality  varies between classes). World looks and feels great, tho the cops are still a teleporting mistery and losing them's kind of a joke. For enjoyable gameplay I suggest setting crowd density to medium or low.

It still has long way to go to be ""perfect"", but it really isn't as bad as everyone says it is."
1609641703,"There’s something to be said for tearing through the early morning industrial hoods of Night City on your Akira inspired Yaiba Kusanagi CT-3X motorcycle while blasting the empty beats of Radio PEBKAC, it’s a mood like many others the game captures which sets the tone for what could have been a fantastic game.

While beneath all the bugs there’s some fun gameplay and interesting stories to be found, the lack of polish, numerous bad design decisions (especially with regards to the in game GPS), and performance demands even at low settings on modestly spec’d computers, makes it difficult to enjoy those shining moments and scattered references to pop cyberpunk culture.

Avoid it for now, but definitely consider giving it a go once the bugs are patched."
1609641775,"I didn't know much going into this game other than the guys who made The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt and a lot of the support titles. I missed the launch of the Witcher 3 and apparently that was a bugfest and back then I didn't really think much of the game. Fast fwd 5 years and I finally get around to the wild hunt and sunk 100+ hours into it including all the DLC. 
I was ready for CDPRs next success and be at the front of it instead of at the end of it.

Heres what I knew about Cyberpunk
It was a FPS
It was openworld
It had keanu reeves
if it was like the witcher it would have romance/skill tree/choicesmatter

I got what I expected! 

Then I looked at what they promised and I was like... I really hope they get there with some patches and extra work

maybe they'll release a 2.0 at some  point along with the dlc. I don't know how easy it would be to integrate everything but it would be great to have a reason to play it through again. Same but different. 

Obviously there's been a few bugs
I've gotten softlocked a few times with conversations or phone calls just not completing and bugging out
I've had to work around some bugged quests
I've had the typical car bugs where it just spawns and blows things up
Funny NPC graphical bugs 

despite it all, still had a blast."
1609641682,"a glitchy mess at times, at others it is the most beautiful thing i've ever seen. Fighting is fun, driving is ehh."
1609641584,"[b] 'You believe you have cheated death? It is death that has cheated you.' [/b]

A truly remarkable achievement in video game narrative design. Beside all its faults, Cyberpunk falls nothing short of greatness because of its gripping story, engaging dialogue, characters you care about, and deep questions that will make you ponder the very meaning of existence. It captivates you with a pertinent theme that underlies the whole philosophy of its story, and remarkably relates that theme with just as much potency in each of its branching story-lines; [spoiler] one of death and its frightening inevitability. In Cyberpunk 2077, you immerse yourself into Night City, and you don't only live as V, you die as V. [/spoiler]"
1609641438,"Every update that rolls in fixes more bugs. As long as you have the machine to run it, it's a great game."
1609641412,"While I feel this game didn't live up to the hype , it still has a lot of potential and is still a very enjoyable game. with updates, dlc, and mod support this game can quickly go from a 8.5/10 to a true masterpiece."

1609803889,"Cyberpunk 2077 is honestly the best game I've ever played!

Every aspect of the game is good: progression, upgrades, story, characters, weapons, looting and gameplay.

Ok, you need a good PC to run it. 
Ok, there are bugs, but those are honestly funny when they're not game breaking.

Overall, Cyberpunk is a really good game and you'll always want to come back to it.

Never ran into any game breaking bugs, only ones that would make me laugh.  The graphics are incredible; I have my game set at all high settings and I get a stable 60fps.

I had very little experience with the Cyberpunk universe before this game, but it has a lot of charm, despite its nihilistic take on things.  Definitely a game I would recommend for anyone interested in a gross between GTA V,  Skyrim, and Blade Runner."
1609639888,"Like everything about the game, it is the first game in a long time that has me wanting to play more and more of it."
1609639828,"Having played this title for over 80 hours, there are a few game breaking glitches that force me to not recommend this title to friends:
1. Random invincibility for enemies (normally during a cyberpsyco mission)
2. The failure of cameras to remain off post successful hack (within the same network)
3. AI spotting you through walls.

These three issues above remove considerable enjoyment from the game."
1609639709,"Just starting into the game, but impressed so far. I will say this, this game is not a run and gun through the fight sequences. Really need to be patient and plan the attack because the guns alone won't do it. Great challenge and a fantastic world to get lost in."

1609639442,"Excellent game!  I have encountered a few bugs here and there but nothing major.  This game really feels like I am there with how the game feels inside the city with the sights and sounds.  The graphics are top notch and looks very realistic.  I have an i7-9700k, 32GB RAM and an RTX 3090 and I am getting 60 frames at 4k.  This game is excellent on PC and a must play for people who like action RPG's like fallout"

1609639419,"Awesome story with many hours of gameplay. I have seen a few bugs (PC Gaming) here and there, but nothing game breaking imo."
1609639412,"I would like to play Cyberpunk longer, but pretending that bad, glitchy, almost amateurish game is good, doesn't make anything better. Everything makes things worse, because RED thinks they can hype their game for 8 years and then release unfinished, boring mess that has worse AI, world, and NPCs ever ... Story is bland and linear. Player is getting a lot of dialogue options but it doesn't change plot at all. Very long cutscenes, and interactions during the gameplay are pushing player to click C very often and just move forward without waiting forever for something that won't change anything. Another f-up af thing is the optimization... Tried to play it on my PC where all other games work like a charm in ultra 4k achieving around 45-120fps where Cyberpunk even with full low settings is having max 10-15fps and is unplayable. Spent around 30h in the game run in small window, and don't have anymore patience to play. Huge disappointment CD Project RED."
1609639390,"The game runs like piss. 30fps on ultra and 30fps on low and the frame rate dropped to being unplayable every time i move.

Note i don't have a bad PC 1070ti overclocked to preform a little better than a 1080 in most games."
1609885782,"Unfinished game, it's good but you can tell this wasn't how it's supposed to be. Lots of fun things to do but everything feels like a unifinished school project. 
 Starts strongs and then hits a brick wall T posing and all. I've been running around on foot and fell through the map. Ai have jumped into the road, I have jumped up to grab a ledge and been launched into orbit just to plummet to my death mid misssion. laughter and aggrivation aside, it's not worth $60.
 Wait till it's released in full with cut-content (devs admit this already) or just accept  the bugs, get it on discount and enjoy what it is. A fun buggy mess."
1609639316,"Occasionally you get the Skyrim bug where stuff loads in and goes flying or is half embedded in the scenery. Occasionally you kill someone and their gun gets jammed inside a barrel and you can't loot it or them maybe. Occasionally you slip on some scenery and the damage kills you - found this mostly in the badlands where terrain is more varied.

However - this game is awesome - it's got some serious storytelling going on, some really relatable characters and a top notch combat system and enough variation in ways to engage where your skill trees become neat positives and not a hindrance if you decide on something but not something else - there's no early game hacks IMO - just do what you enjoy and it'll probably work out. Also, don't go read guides - I was trying to understand the character relationships and realised that I stopped engaging in the story because i was looking for cues instead -  just walk through the game soaking in the random encounters and people which vary between situations. Guns, armour - all that jazz that's normally the Power Players wet dream of statistical analysis - doesn't really matter a whole lot as long as you do upgrade / buy new / wear what you find. Find cover, point and shoot - hit them with some entertaining melee weapons or just hack them to death from afar whilst they wander around. It all works so well together, it's easy to miss how unbelievably awesome the combat is. The finance side of things seems balanced - random encounters and side missions provide good earnings and usually there is some junk to find which might be worth something. Nothing so far has been a waste of my game time and I've enjoyed switching styles to benefit from the quicker levelling and perks. I might not have any perks with a handgun but I can still use one enough to get the perk points which i put in another tree. Playing on a RTX 3080 - this game is beautiful and only in the badlands have i seen some dodgy textures which are again due to the rough surfaces. If you genuinely like RPG games then this is for you."
1609639459,"pros: fantastic graphics on a gtx 1070 at 45 fps.
good story with relationships that dont feel fake. (best side job is dream on)
good gunplay
feels like the city doesnt revolve around you, immersion is decent
romance is good (especially panam lmao)
Cons: lots of bugs, mostly minor visual bugs though
horrible dialogue with the nc citizens, they disappear sometimes
horrendous police system, they appear out of thin air
bad glitches and money exploits (especially with the ""Space Oddity"" mission (you can sell and buy the same painting for 3595 eddies profits over and over again))
gigs are dull in my opinion
some fantastic side missions seem to be cut short (especially the dream on mission aka the best one) Some side missions expansion dlc would be lovely
poor optimization (i heard there was low fps on max settings with an rtx 3090)

Buy the damn game you fool"
1609639286,"We've all heard about the hilariously stupid glitches and bugs, all of us playing the game have experienced them but aside from all of the technical issues, it's a great game, it's a well written game, there's plenty of stuff to do. Therefore, I'd recommend buying it. Yes CDPR have a LONG way to go and many things to fix, I'm expecting big results from it. So in summary: It's buggy, it's full of glitches and seriously under-prepped but it's a good game and I'd recommend it."
1609639274,"This game is a combination of Deus Ex and GTA V. That is a good thing. Bugs aside, I highly recommend it for the story, the expansive city, and the length of the game.

PLEASE NOTE: There is a secret route near the end that is awesome but requires a very specific approach to unlock. If interested, I recommend looking up instructions for this secret ending."
1609639236,I love this game! 60 hours in and I'm having so much fun. So much to do so much to see.
1609801668,Impressive c0ck
1609639088,"I am not hating this game for bugs, everyone is already done that.

I just think as a RPG its a bit hollow, Idk how to describe it kinda empty. I played a Corpo and Nomad and didnt feel there was much diffrence.  The game does a poor job on trying to get you attached to most of the charaters and most of them are forgettable to me with the expection of Johnny Silverhand who that game kinda forces down your througt. A little spoiler but no matter what you do in every play through hes there barking orders at you, like every charater mostly. In the start of the game when you are in the open world every other second someone is telling you take care of something super urgent and then that same person tells you to do something else also plus with urgency."
1609639002,Great game. Don't listen to the reviewers and haters.
1609638945,"I wish you could install a graphics card cybernetic so the game will run smother.
"
1609638794,"In a lot of ways not what I expected.

Worth playing just for the incredibly good story alone.

Combat is decent, slowmo + katanas is great fun.

Rpg elements feel a bit tacked on and meh. side missions range from fetch quests to fantastic fleshed out side story missions and its hard to tell them apart.

Had some serious crashing issues, with the inventory screen and mirrors and cutscenes. To avoid these crashes I waited 5 seconds before opening the equipment screen and for mirrors/cutscenes the fix is to cap your framerat at 15-20 fps.

Also you can bug out the slowmo mode, to fix this you need to install the dodge slowmo and use that, and maybe reset perks as well (u can use cheatengine to recover the eddies)

Overall a fantastic story with solid gameplay, marred by some technical issues and clearly rushed things (buying cars use the side mission system) but you overlook these issues to keep playing an awesome game."
1609638780,Loving it so far. Have completed 2 of the available endings and am slowly working towards completionist. Some minor bugs notwithstanding the game plays smoothly. Wish the enemy AI were better and that destructible objects in the environment made more sense but I'm very excited to see what the forthcoming DLCs will bring to the table.
1609638737,"46.5 Hours it took me to finish my first playthrough.

This game got a bad rap. I played it two weeks after release and didn't experience any game-breaking bugs. There were some annoying bugs (Subtitles staying on screen after dialog) but nothing that put a damper on the gameplay. There's about 16 hours of main story line but many more hours of side missions that are fully voice acted and contribute to the finale. I finished most of the side missions but there were plenty of Gigs and other tasks to do and spend time. Not to mention lots of eddies to be earned to buy all those preem cars.

TLDR
Story- 9/10
Voice acting- 10/10
Gameplay- 6-10
Graphics- 7/10
Replayability- 7/10

1609638311,"Q: Should I buy Cyberpunk 2077 right now?

A:  If you have a high-end PC and you liked the Witcher 3, go for it. This game nails almost every aspect of what made that game great. Phenomenal storytelling, characters, sidequests, and music are what make this game a diamond in the rough. 

If you have a mid-range or weak PC, and if you prefer sandbox open worlds like GTA or The Elder Scrolls, then you should avoid this game right now. Performance is rough for all but the best computers, and this game barely tries to be a sandbox.  

I gave this game a positive review because sandbox RPGs have bored the shit out of me over the last 10+ years and I'm glad this game invested time and money into areas that other studios often neglect. I don't really want to gun down civilians or get into police chases, I want to be told a great story. Cyberpunk delivered on that. Until the bugs are fixed I'd put this game alongside Fallout New Vegas: a flawed masterpiece."
1609638299,"This game is FULL OF BUGS!  What a piece of Caca.
More then 50% of the missions are buggy. Those moron never tested correctly there scripts.

1609638216,50 Hours of play at this point. Would i buy it again? Yes. Its a great concept and does really well during many parts fo the gameplay but it is also very very unfinished at release. I haven't really had alot of the glitches you see videos of online and the game has been 80-90% playable without issues. Overall I am really enjoying it.
1609638171,lots of bugs and glitches but one of the best story-driven games i've played ever
1609638163,"I got to play as a trans woman in cyber city but the game itself sucked so I guess I should give it a bad review. Ran into a gamebreaking bug halfway thru my save but the game wasn't fun or unique enough for me to feel like it would be worth my time to start over. The game wasn't anything new, just another story-driven fps-rpg with really cool music. I can't even fuck with my girldick. 3/10 maybe I'll revise that when future updates come out. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk."

1609638063,"I'm writing this right after returning to the open world before meeting Hanako at Embers, Nomad route, first playthrough. I bought this game day one, and I played intermittently between time at work and friends. After 142 hours of 100%ing every side op and scanner hustle I have finally closed the book on V's journey. I focused on body attributes and leveled that to 19, followed by Tech, 18. High-tier reflex meant every weapon I made (save for smart-links) I was using to their full potential. I entered Embers with every weapon inventory made by me.

Typically, growing up behind a controller, I found the games I love give me means of approaching the problems I needed to solve, my way. Cyberpunk is achieves this in spades. I know future playthroughs I'll take different quest routes, with different methods of problem solving. But this game does something I believe every game should do; Affirm the player that the decisions they make will prove fruitful. Far too many times, I play a game and find the game has chosen what I should do, for me. Or perhaps, my preferred strategy is forlorn for some player interaction or cutscene. 2077 did its best to keep this feeling at a bare minimum, something truly important for me.

None of these caveats come without drawbacks. Over 142 hours, I had one crash to desktop. This was right after entering a large scanner op in a park, deep into the city. I can forgive my 1070 for that one hiccup to my steam app. Sometimes, the physics can seem wonky but that adds to the  charm of my Budget Arms Savage with 2000 DPS. Sometimes, the weapon progression can feel daunting, swapping auto-aim weapons for the more punchy power weapons was a choice that benefited me, sure, but I know pulling that option from V could not experience the full breadth of weaponry. I know this can be remedied by further play, and I'll update again if I find means of solving this problem in the next 150 hours of play.

I'll be playing this game again and again, and I can't wait to see what I find. I'm happy the wait was all worth it, and I finally had a chance to sink my teeth into something like this. ~150 hours on a first campaign playthrough? I didn't do that with Skyrim. The only other game where I 100% the side missions was AC: Unity of the XBox 1 and that's because I had no PC and it was the only game that did what it did. Having the feeling of yearning to find as much as I can is not prevalent for me anymore, and this game provided such a sensation for a guy like me, in a time like this."
1609638048,"Playing this game was great experience.
Thank you CDPR for making this game, I don't regret time spent for this. I really attached to the characters in game so ending this great story was really painfull. I really felt it. It was like watching ""Green Mile"" but I was part of it. Sad but also great experience.
I hope that CDPR will make more games like that. Of course without do many bugs and glitches. ;)
""See you in major leagues..."""
1609637918,Love this game! Feeds my needs for cyberpunk and wanderlust.
1609637909,"For all it's problems, and there are a lot of problems there is one thing this game excels at one thing and that is the way the game ends. I could go on about the repetitive gameplay and plethera of bugs and glitches but those have been talked to death already so instead I want to shine a light on what else this game does right. I can't think of a game in the resent past that had such an impactful ending than this game. While I gave this a positive review and absolutely loved the way the creators crafted the endings I must say that you shouldn't get this until all the glitches have been ironed out or there is a good sale that marks down the price. I think though that it is my duty to say that I encountered no bugs that made this a deal breaker for me though that is something for you to decide. All in all I enjoyed my time and hope that like No Man Sky that this game will get the care and attention it deseveres and reaches the point it should have been upon release."

1609637684,It may have its flaws but i still recommend this game. At the time of posting this its just after launch but trust me it will improve.

1609637449,"good game fuck reddit
"
1609637410,Perfectly encapsulates the genre. Very enjoyable. I loved it.
1609637407,"Where to even begin? Let's start by assuming that you live under a rock and have no ideia what CP2077 is. So Cyberpunk is an open world first person RPG, made by CD Projekt Red, the same people who made the Witcher 3. Now the Witcher 3 is a game known for highly detailed enviroments, tight gameplay and intricate storyline where the players choices affect the outcome of the story deeply. Does Cyberpunk also have all of these things? Huh... yes and no. Let's go step by step here.
As far as the open world there is a lot of detail here, Night City is a beautiful place to explore and drive around and there's plenty to do, thing is some of the side quests and activities you encounter feel like they are there just to fill space around the map, others are much more highly detailed and will have choices that will have you question your moral compass which is always a plus in my book.
Graphics wise the game is absolutly gorgeous, at least when things are working properly, at the time of writing this review the current patch is 1.06 and some fixes have been implemented but it is unfortunatly a reality that this game suffers from a lot of visual bugs and performance issues, depending on your spec you can have a smooth 60 fps experience with few visual glitches or a crappy 20 fps with stuff not rendering properly. Hopefully this will get fixed soon.
As far as the gameplay goes you will either be playing a standart ""RPGish"" shooter in line with Borderlands or Deus Ex or a more intricate stealth game, there's nothing revolutionary there except if you go full on with hacking and stealth and while the shooting is fun and satisfactory it did wear out on me and I did find myself switching from my big armored big guns build to a more stealth and hack focused build and having a lot more fun with it.
Now where the game really shines is in the story... when the visual bugs don't ruin the immersion. I had some  emotional and cool scenes in the story somewhat ruined by floating objects, textures not rendering, and animations not playing properly. Fortunatly these issues weren't that common in the main story quests. The premise is that you have an anti-corporate terrorist stuck in your brain and the tech where he's stored in is slowly killing you and you need to try and find a way to pull him out without killing yourself. A looooot happens afterwards and some of the choices you'll make are incredibly difficult, not only because of the characters you encounter throughout but also because of Johnny, Keanu Reeve's character that's stuck in your brain, who even though is a straight up a-hole he has this way of making you question the motives of the characters you interact and you also kind of end up having this weird friendship with him... if you want to that is. So you'll have choices aplenty and live to regret them all, there's a lot of good stuff in the main story. Only bad thing I can think about it is the pacing, you'll eventually have 3 main quests that branch off and you're required to finish all 3 to finish the game with a final one, thing is it definitly feels like they're supposed to be played in a certain order and for whatever reason they decided to have them scale with your level and just have them be played whenever you want, which can lead to some weird de-escalations when you finish one of them and end up begining another.
As far as everything else, sound design is pretty good, the music fits the universe very well, and presentation wise it does feel cyberpunk turned up to 11 so if you're into that sweet future dystopia you'll love this games look.
So yeah Cyberpunk 2077, is it a revolutionary game? No, but it is a very good game and there's definitly some very neat and unique ideias here. For me it was definitly worth the purchase, despite the obvious rushed development problems, but depending on what you're expecting you might not be satisfied. 

TL:DR - a very good game with an unfortunate rushed developement, buy it if it's your thing, wait for sale if you're skeptical, wait for more updates if you don't want to deal with bugs and visual glitches"
1609637367,THERE IS NO ACHIeVEMENT FOR WATCHING ALL CREDITS.
1609637352,The game is fantastic if you have the system to run it.  10900k and RTX 3080 without game breaking frames or major issues
1609637277,good
1609637275,"dont rush it, take your time and do the side quests."
1609637248,"I cannot in good conscience recommend this game in its current state. To anyone. 

I ran this game on a high-end PC with an RTX 3080 GPU and enough specs to boot most games at ultra settings without breaking a sweat. Somehow, Cyberpunk still managed to run at lower than 20 FPS when I'm not even out in the open. The real kick in the guts is that FPS didn't improve one bit even when I lowered all graphics settings to the absolute minimum. 

I've already tried every single solution on the Nvidia forums and Reddit. Nothing worked. 13 FPS is unplayable.

Other problems I've had with the game:

- Driving is sluggish and unfun.
- Like many other games, playing on ""Hard"" is just playing against bullet sponges that hit harder.
-  Music on the radio is abysmal. 
- The game just straight up CRASHES when I change any graphics settings in fullscreen mode.
- The game also crashes when I mess with settings related to rendering shadows.
- Plenty of times, loot clips through the floor and becomes unobtainable. 
- A lot of seemingly obtainable items out in the world (they're marked with a ""pick up"" icon) cannot be interacted with at all.
- I love playing stealth, so it was disheartening for me to find out a lot of enemies are bugged so that they can see in all directions without turning around, and sometimes even through walls.
- Braindances (e.g. like in Detroit where you rewind a scene to spot details) are boring and take way too long to finish.
- A lot of skill checks around the world unilaterally favor the Tech stat, making people who spec into other stats feel left behind.

This is to say nothing of the tons of immersion-breaking bugs around the open world, from customers telling vendors ""How can I help you?"" to people flying away into the stratosphere like jet-propelled baseballs when sliced with a katana. This was cute when Skyrim did it a decade ago, but not anymore.

Sadly, I could go on.

I requested a refund. I can't play the game like it is now, and do not want to anymore. 

My hope is that CD Projekt Red will change my mind one day."
1609637241,"Despite all of the bugs, the game is still 100% worth it. Not many other games out there like it. The aesthetic and world-building are especially great. Would recommend."
1609979645,"As a disclaimer before anything else, you should know this game has many rough edges and is not currently the product promised to you from CDPR's marketing during earlier development. There are numerous bugs, glitches, performance issues, missing features, hidden/unexplained systems, and occasionally things that just don't work or not as you'd expect. It needs a lot of improvement which I expect the game to receive over the following months as this CDPR had done for The Witcher 3.

That being said, I do believe this is a great game if you can look past its many apparent flaws and be fortunate enough not to encounter any game-breaking issues. I went in expecting The Witcher meets the cyberpunk genre and that's really what Cyberpunk 2077 is at its core. This is not a GTA cyberpunk mashup or a ground breaking RPG. I'll breakdown a few different broad aspects of the game below or you can skip to the end for a rough TL;DR.

[b][u]Story & Characters[/u][/b]
I found the story quite compelling but the pacing is terrible early on and the plot doesn't really kick off until after the first act. The main story is rather short but there are a myriad of side stories- the ones revolving around important side characters being rather long and can offer you additional endings after 'the point of no return' in your journey. The amount of content among all these subplots definitely outweighs that of the main story. The different routes you can take in the story further pad the available content but more often than not your choices in dialogue are merely flavor rather than branching story paths. 

While there aren't that many interesting side characters with significant depth, the ones we get are fantastic. The characters you come across with their own chain of quests are easy to get attached to as you aid them in their struggles and deepen your relationships. Usually its a tale of revenge but there are more unique side stories. Easily my favorite part about the main cast of characters is what each have to say to you once you beat the game, which varies depending on if/how you completed their respective quests. I found the narrative payoff of these characters and their subplots more rewarding than that of the main story but both are powerful and most definitely worthwhile.

[b][u]Combat & Gameplay[/u][/b]
Combat can be varied depending on how you choose to approach it but often gets repetitive as you find a playstyle you enjoy and cater your build around. The game rewards you for specialization over generalization as you stack relevant damage bonuses and modifiers allowing you to output absurd amounts of damage which can trivialize even the hardest difficulty. Despite this, it's still important to recognize the depth of options available for you to consider both in how you can build your character and how you approach individual encounters. And, while you may only settle for one particular strategy there is still something satisfying in laying waste to your enemies with a well optimized build. Be warned that crafting [i]is crucial[/i] if you want to use the best gear and make your character as strong as they can be, meaning Technical will always be one of the attributes you look to max if this is important to you.

I found the combat enjoyable but not something I really craved. It served as a nice breakaway when I was tired of processing dialogue and playing detective throughout the story. You can easily go on sprees of side gigs and NCPD hustles which usually boil down to killing a group of enemies and collecting something. I prefer stealth and hacking as I find them more rewarding but more straightforward gun and melee builds are more effective overall. There are missions which reward you for handling things without killing or getting caught but these are manageable without heavy investment in stealth related perks.

[b][u]World & Exploration[/u][/b]
It's no secret this game is visually stunning- setting aside the visual bugs of course. Night City is beautiful and captures the cyberpunk aesthetic through and through. It's a dense metropolis with seemingly something to do or find around nearly every corner- in case the cluttered map wasn't any indication. It's one of the only games I actively avoid using fast travel because it's such a pleasure walking or driving around with the radio on. While most the loot you come across in exploration is an abundance of consumables, junk, or dismantle fodder, I do enjoy 
collecting various data shards and reading messages on computers with little tidbits of conversations or world building lore. It makes the game feel lived in despite its lackluster inhabitants: civilians which hardly respond to you, nonexistent traffic AI, and relentless cops. Moreso than any other game I have played, I find it humbling to read into the lives other npcs; it really feels like a world where you are 1 character among many struggling to survive despite how often insignificant these npcs really are.

Once you obtain upgrades like a double jump and improve your Body and/or Technical stats (to open prompted locked doors) the world really opens up to you. You are able to mantle your way up places you'd think would be off limits, but where there is a ledge there is a way. There really aren't any secrets to uncover from jumping around rooftops or scaling buildings but you can get some really gorgeous views and screenshots. For those that like to explore it's definitely nice to be able to do so.

[b][u]OVERALL[/u][/b]
At its core I think Cyberpunk 2077 is a good game with more potential once the bulk of its current issues get patched or modded by the community. Aside from the gorgeous and stylistic setting Cyberpunk 2077 takes place in, I don't think the many systems and aspects of gameplay are particularly great or polished on their own yet together make up something that is worth more than the sum of its parts. There's a lot of diverse content here for completionists with an interesting story and some great characters for you to invest in. There's replayability with the many ways you can define and outfit your character on top of the choices you make throughout the story. While you can work towards all the available endings in each of your playthroughs the path you take to get there still matters. Despite whatever was marketed this is essentially The Witcher 3 in a cyberpunk universe. If you enjoy games in vein of The Witcher 3 this will be right up your alley, but it's best to wait until the game is in a better state if you want the best possible experience."
1609637093,"I've fallen in love with this game and it's world. Yes it maybe buggy at times, but nothing ever game breaking in my experience, just the odd visual bug and a car casually exploding, ya'know the usual Bethesda like bugs."
1609637024,"I was one of the people genuinely excited for CP2077. After the time I have put in on PC, I can say that while it didn't live up to all of my expectations, it met most of them with flying colors. I can tell it's a game that was released prior to being ready, but with some patches/updates it will be an RPG to remember."
1609636967,"Needs some good polish, but otherwise a solid game.

+ Shooting is amazing
+ Hacking is rewarding
+ Melee is brutal
- Driving is clunky
- Graphics are buggy
- Story feels forced a lot

And crafting needs to be patched. Can be great, can be terrible."

1609636800,Bladerunner vibes
1609636730,I've never seen such a fun game get so much hate. 77 hours in and I've been having a blast the whole time. I don't watch many trailers or read up on games before they come out to keep the experience fresh when I get the game. So I can't really speak to the hype that this game supposedly isn't living up to. I only know I'm having one of the best times in a game world I've had in a long time.
1609636724,look past some bugs and its a beautiful game
1609636425,"It is an alright game that suffered from over-hype like many do. It will never be a great game but it can be enjoyable. The story is good, the visuals are great, and everything else is mediocre and bland. There is little player control and the gear is uninspired and does offer much reason to think about what you use. The cyberware is largely disappointing outside of a few, the cars are wack (the motorcycles are pretty nice though), and there's only like 5 guns. I could go on but I won't.
At this time I would not recommend buying it. Wait until they fix their shit and even until they improve features and playability. It is a sorry excuse for a 2020 AAA game. It lacks functionality that has been expected for several years. It also has many questionable decisions that directly impact the player's experience (for example: the hand to hand combat is some of the worst I have ever seen and is so bad it effects other aspects of the game such as stealth which you think would be unrelated). It can certainly be enjoyable but I recommend against reinforcing this behavior from publishers and holding onto your money until the game is actually done at which point it will likely be on sale too."

The story is solid, the game play is fun, the characters are interesting, the world is vibrant, and through it all you can pick a path / play style that suites you. Another impressive thing is Cyberpunk has moments where NPC's emotions & mannerisms feel close to real.

Dont get me wrong, i am not saying Cyberpunk is perfect, it has bugs and issues still. A big one is the driving is terrible, cars slide all over the place for no reason exc. Overall though the good far outweighs the bad. Most of the bugs i have found are amusing as opposed to detrimental to game play.

a solid 4.5 out of 5"
1609636316,"I really liked the game. The story is awesome, graphics are clean, and the game play is fun. Some of the glitches can be kind of funny to annoying kind that can take you out of the world. I would recommend this game for anyone that likes a solid RPG."
1609636302,Pretty good
1609636242,Game is broken trash. Everything promised for eight years is missing. Avoid this glitch filled garbage.
1609636252,Is certified bug free
1609636017,"This was the best game I've played in years.  Good gun dynamics, engaging storyline, and characters you care about. 10/10 

I am looking forward to upgrading my pc, and enjoying it all over again with better graphics."
1609636017,bad
1609636425,"Thoroughly enjoyed my run through Cyberpunk 2077. I did all the quests, gigs, and markers I could find. Highlight for me was the story and character development. A lot of the story lines are thematically profound, and the fates of most characters can be depressing or satisfying depending on your decisions, which is really a hallmark of CD Projekt Red.

Other content can be a mixed bag. Exploration, music, and racing are enjoyable; whereas the fistfighting, crafting, and navigation can be tedious but rewarding. Combat feels like your generic shooter or slasher, depending on your style; but CDPR allowed players to circumvent it altogether by going for a hacker or stealth approach, which I actually found more enjoyable.

I generally found the bugs to be funny or easily dealt with. I didn't have many crashes on PC; in fact I can count them on one hand throughout all my 200 hours. There were UI glitches which are easily taken care of by save/reload [get an SSD!]. Losing 100 Eddies because my car happened to spawn upside-down and explode might irritate some, but it's literally not a problem for anyone who loots, hacks, and crafts.

If you're just someone who is into shooting stuff, rushing through the main quests as fast as possible, and have a low tolerance for bugs, a different game might suit you better.

I recommend this game for PC gamers who are into thoroughly fleshing out characters and worlds. If you have a natural hunger for seeing what's out there, learning what makes characters tick, asking yourself ""what happens next?"", and have a high tolerance for bugs, you'll love this game like I have."
1609635990,"It's fun, I love 30 fps. It's like playing on the xbox 360!!!!"
1609635977,"Ever with all the complaints, I have had a great time with the game. There are obviously going to be issues with any game this large."
1609635758,"Well after 121 hours I've finally finished Cyberpunk 2077. What a masterpiece! Yes it has some bugs but the depth of story and graphics really immerse you in the world like few others. CPDR really are the masters of the RPG's these days. Was lucky to play on a high end rig which solves a lot of the issues I think. If you can wait a few months for the Jan and Feb updates it would be worth it :)
"
1609635721,The good far outweigh the bad.  Will have 100s of hours in the this game over the years.
1609635701,Don't complain about performance when you try to play this game on your old Windows 95 computer.
1609635665,"I love this game; I'll go ahead and put that out there right off the bat. I have an incredibly high tolerance to bugs and glitches, which are aplenty. Once you finish act 1, you cannot go more than a minute without encountering bugs. I guarantee you will be bothered more by bugs than I am. Wait to buy this game. Give this game a few months to be fixed, but don't expect the game to be finished even by then."
1609635470,I love it
1609635426,"I have waited so long for this game and it did not disappoint. There are some bug, ofc, but the game play and the story are amazing. Really great job."
1609635313,I like the cyberpunk setting. Night City feels alive and fun.
1609635308,"Definitely very buggy, but the story has me hooked and I'm enjoying (almost) every moment of it."
1609635243,"Cyberpunk 2077 in it's launch configuration was not exactly to the quality I expected.  I had a few graphics issues with my 1060 3Gb which was on the low end of the specs.  This was mostly resolved by windowing the application and playing on lower pixel resolution with medium settings.  

I was disappointed in the customization for your character when starting as well as guns and cars after you've gotten going a little bit.  The game is fun and functional but has many visual bugs.  The combat is quick and different due to hacking enemies and augmenting yourself.  The enemy AI is pretty bad and so I haven't found the game very challenging but it's a relaxing after work game.  I'd recommend people who would like action adventure check it out but if you're into RPG's it's not as in depth as Elder Scrolls or Fallout.  Perhaps after sometime with updates that won't always be true."

gib us game, no more delays. 
All I got to say is, good luck CDPR, still love the game. Thanks for all your detail and hard work."
1609634847,"This game is very enjoyable, 2060 Super runs RT Medium at about 50 to 60 FPS."
1609634766,is very good
1609634745,"great game, you should buy"
1609634693,"I have rarely written reviews, but after 90+ hours playing 2077, I had to share.

Bottom Line 
WAIT for the game (on PC for now) to drop in price if you really wanna play it.
Otherwise give it a miss and wait and see if it gets fixed and mods are developed that make it a far more robust game. There is little next gen experience.

Yes there is some fun to be had, but nothing like promoted or promised.

CPR was the last developer I trusted with games & was happy to pre-order. But unfortunately, this has now changed. It’s so sad to see CPR and the staff, who appeared to work so hard on this, fall so short. I hope one day we get to understand what on Earth really happened. 

Currently:

NPC's Broken 
No intelligence, no promised routines or interactions 

Driving broken
Poor controls, poor AI, disappointing mechanics

Police broken
Overpowered

Shops/buying poor
Basic, no real interactions

Main story is good
Interesting & very well produced

Gameplay OK (non main story)
Some fun here with play-style and skill tree tweaks
Some great weapons to discover
Complex random encounters with enemies are not what they seem, little depth, rinse repeat
Immersion in the world of the game is lacking
Not enough variety to keep a person interested

Looting 
You can loot anything with no repercussions, which is fine, but is not the NPC AI we were promised 

Crafting Broken
Can create extra raw materials from other items out of thin air, values don't match

Bugs
A plenty

1609634649,"Despite whatever glitches you may come across, the game has an incredible atmo and some very solid game mechanics.  The story is awesome and a real pleasure to experience.  Once they get the bugs and what not hammered out this game will be lauded as much as Witcher 3, maybe more so if only for the incredibly detailed city."

1609634139,"This game is a very deep, provocative and buggy experience. Amazingly well developed narrative and environments. Meaningful choices, plot twists, variety of humor, food for though and simply awesome gameplay. Deus Ex mixed with Watch Dogs as a more thorough and polished story-driven game, despite the technical bugs. The richness and visual polish of this game is a new mark to hit. Cleverness of quest travel and level design can easily be used as a new reference of standard for open world games. Do it! Cyberpunk 2077!"

1609633537,cyberpunk
1609633492,"The game is full of many overwhelming glitches, and unfortunately as a result the game is an unplayable mess. I intentionally delayed purchasing the game for nearly a month post-release in an attempt to wait for any software bugs present to be addressed, and that doesn't appear to have happened. People continue to make excuses for developers releasing unfinished products at premium prices under the idea that it is somehow alright to let a company deliberately sell barely usable goods to a consumer so long as the product is ""too new."" If I attempted to list the amount of catastrophic malfunctions I've dealt with, or the amount of steps I have had to take in order to try addressing said defects on my own, I would not have enough space in the character limit provided to recount them. Perhaps if the launch price was reduced a considerable amount, a level of technical drawbacks would be understandable to a degree, as it is generally assumed by a consumer that you get what you pay for, although as it sits with it's 60 USD sell price I cannot justify the fact that the game no longer even makes it past the launch screen when I attempt to boot it up. If a product is incomplete, you shouldn't sell; if you disagree with that sentiment and think that this sort of practice would be allowed in any other industry, you are to blame for how common these situations are."
1609634205,"NOT READY - which is a shame because I really wanted to like this game.
> The engaging storyline only lasts for a weekend of gameplay. Side quests are only unique due to different city-district locations - otherwise not really.
> I'm discouraged to roam and explore because rooftops, ledges, and piping have poorly-meshed planes and you can insta-die for no reason.
> For as much as the marketing team hyped the graphics, the street-level texture/mesh detail still seems blocky (as a whole) - despite High graphic settings. The Ray-tracing and DLSS perform as expected.
> The AI system is atrocious - which I think is the biggest disappointment about this game. The developer boasted about character interactions with their surroundings, in a dynamic dystopian cityscape - Wrong! The NPCs blurt the same canned voice lines while going about their business, if they even talk to you at all. The overwhelming majority of the street vendors and a store fronts don't interact (no menu/lock doors). Also, the traffic system is so robotic I feel like I'm in GTA3. Traffic will occasionally jam for no reason at all despite clear roads ahead.
> The character customization is more limited than I anticipated. Once you confirm your choice of appearance, there's no going back - not even to change your hair style. Cars, Trucks, Motorcycles, and Weapons - none of them are customizable.
> ALL YOU NEED IN COMBAT IS ""PING"" CYBERWARE AND A SNIPER RIFLE. GG. You can shoot highlighted enemies through walls with no danger to your character.

Wiff. The attempt was made - I guess."

1609633319,"Absolutely great game, would recommend it."
1609633243,Eh buggy to hell overall decent game. It was promoted too early and gained too much traction before it was even near done. Buy it now if you want to play it they will for sure fix the game.
1609633237,Such a great game
1609633191,Waste of $
1609633129,"Fantastic story and stellar sidequests - reports of game being unplayable are severely overblown. In over 100 hours, very few bugs popped up which hindered gameplay in any way, and visual bugs were not much more than generally expected from a newly released game after first patch or two. Ultimately, it is quite likely that I will end up doing a second or even third playthrough, when DLC is completed. Thoroughly enjoyed the game"
1609633113,"Honestly loved it, sad that the main story is quite short but if you actually play the side quests, it all fills up nicely."

1609632620,yes
1609632600,"Cyberpunk 2077, i have never been in love with an story so much for an game. The graphics are so beautiful, it might be an slightly buggy game. But it is not worse than GTAV Online, so don't be surprised. The charecters for the game have been created to relate, or to love. But they also saw how the gamer love THICCNESS."
1609632568," P.S. If u want to spend a lot of hours and relax its just for u, but if cant suffer everytime when game bugs happens so its not for u.

AND HERE IS A LOT OF STORYLINE BUGS PREPARE UR A$$

1609632470,"its a buggy mess but still tons of fun, please buy this once they fix it more"
1609632432,"would wait a while for more bugs to be ironed out, crafting needs a huge update, feels like im crafting in the early 2000's, there is no auto-crafting, to put it in perspective when crafting items you need crafting parts as one of your ingredients and  certain tier of parts too. you need to craft x amount to get to the next tier etc. imagine you have over 80000 common tier parts and you need legendary grade parts. each craft can't be automatically done. you have to sit there manually hold down your mouse to craft 1 item at a time. this can take hours to just craft components to have your craft ready to make / upgrade to the next teir. bad design in opinion. needs to be more automated especially if you are in your house, out of harms way. we need a faster form of crafting, just running to an npc to buy items is not enough when you go constantly broke trying to upgrade your set of iconic weapons.

this review is still pending as not all content is released for the game and the bugs ( some still game breaking as of 1.06) are still being ironed out. 

P.S. there is a dildo baton weapon, its an iconic melee weapon, have fun google searching for ""Iconic Sir John Phallustiff"" XD"
1609632359,Game is alot of fun
1609632349,"I just finished my first playthrough of Cyberpunk 2077 and it's an excellent game. It's much more story driven than advertised and much less of an open world game or RPG. Don't expect futuristic GTA, its formula is a lot closer to the Witcher 3. Many things could be improved, for example the gunplay is lacking and the skill tree shallow. But the story, setting and characters make this game worth playing through at least once, and I'd recommend it to anyone."
1609632179,no
1609632116,Fish and Chips
1609632115,"Despite the bugs, the game experience overall is quite fun. It is a great RPG with plenty of future potential."
1609632083,i really like it.
1609632082,"A lot of mechanics are undercooked but the story and setting are so satisfying that I would feel terrible giving this game a thumbs down.

Also, if you have an Nvidia card older than the 2070, don't buy.

Overall I would rate this game 8/10. If they address some of the more major annoyances and improve the combat / police AI, I would easily give it 9/10."
1609632033,"Playing on PC on a 2080 Ti and the game has been running great. The bugs everyone keeps complaining about are wayyyy overrated. The game is awesome and fun, addictive and satisfying. It's an incredible game. There's a few glitches and visual hiccups now and again but nothing I would have even commented on if everyone hadn't been all up in arms to crucify CDPR. I realize the console versions might totally suck but the PC version is a solid win"
1609631998,"Albeit the game having a ton of glitchy situations, it is pretty sweet on PC. I like it alot."
1609631985,"The Positives

1. The sounds of the guns were good
2. I enjoyed the music while I was driving

The negatives

You've already heard everything negative 1000 times by now so I wont repeat it again."
1609631974,"begged for a refund even though i am over limit - if i don't get one, then i MAY take it further - as fun as the game is we were heavily lied to on the spec side - i refuse to list them here as i have done on the discussions - look for my post - spec wise this is a LOL-fest.... DO NOT BE CONNED LIKE I WAS!!!!"
1609631915,don't listen to internet trolls. Best Game 2020
1609631845,"Don't listen to the negative reviews, this game is awesome. If you care that much about bugs, wait for a couple patches, but the current state of the game is playable and enjoyable. The open world feels immersive, side quests don't get old, story line is captivating though sometimes confusing. If you're into open-world RPGs, this game is great"
1609631754,"Despite all of the trash talking that's been going around, it's a great game with a very acceptable initial release for a game of its size and scope.  Add to that pressure on developers to release ASAP, covid, and trying to support an EOL generation of consoles (should have said sorry, buy the new gen console if you want to play IMO), and I would call it impressive.  Sure, it's full of bugs and feels a bit lacking in content, but no more so than the initial releases many other comparable popular AAA titles.  The main quest line story is excellent, and overall it's a well put together, fun, and beautiful game.  Assuming the developer continues to roll out bug fixes and additional content, I would bet it will stand the test of time as well as comparable titles"
1609631688,Fantastic
1609631586,"Do not buy this game (yet)
Can I recommend it?
No, not right now. If you expect the next huge game that will be talked about for a long time because of the story, you will be hugely disappointed. If you look for a good RPG, you will be disappointed. If you look for a good first-person shooter, you will be disappointed. If you look for a good open world game, you will be disappointed. If you look for the probably best-looking open world game that takes place in a large city though, then this might be just right for you.
But even if that’s what you want, wait! The game is in an awful technical state and I would not recommend buying it right now if you are not 100% sure you have a setup that can run the game somewhat stable."
1609685040,"Despite some minor issues, this is a really good game - one of the best open world RPGs I have played in 2020. Luckily the PC version did not ship with many of the game-breaking problems that the console versions had. Like many others on Steam, I did encounter plenty of bugs, some minor performance issues, and a few questionable game design choices. Despite these negatives, I had a over 100 hours of fun with this game, and I will likely do another playthrough at some point in 2021 after things get smoothed out. I eagerly await DLC and patches."
1609631523,great game
1609899396,not as awesome. Lots of bugs. Ai = dumb. The game has potential but was over hyped.
1609631451,"I would not buy this game in its current state. Aside from constant bugs there is a significant lack of features. AI is absolutely awful in all regards. The most infuriating part to me was that they tried to sell it as an immersive game but there are far too many things that break immersion. 

All in all, just wait for a complete edition to be out and on sale for like $20 dollars like the Witcher 3"
1609631393,"we were lied to. to avoid the bugs and performance bs, the best thing to do is avoid exploring (lets be real the only exploring is looking and sight seeing) which gets old very quickly and to just focus on the main story and even doing that and being done with the game, you feel cheated. Because I didn't opt into this product to play a linear story.
-cutscene
-go do this
-oh shit something went wrong doing that
-oh well
-do dis now
-clear those baddies
It's a dialogue filled call of duty linear single player experience, with their buggy open world and skillsets that you level up that do not change much of how you engage in the same fights over and over again. not to mention until high teen lvls you are soft capped, dying 1 shot to enemies you ""shouldn't"" be messing with yet because the game wants you to feel powerful when you reach a certain level to when you will just blast through these enemies once you hit that level. So player progression feels scripted and does not rely on the whole start at nothing and craft your character to be as powerful as you make them. they just uncap the damage and health of enemies.

Do not buy."
1609631390,"The game has some work to be done, and it isn't a masterpiece of gaming, but it is fun. My biggest complaint is the lack of a real AI police pursuit programming- the cops just will not chase you through the streets of the city. they kinda suck at an AI level. Most of the AI in the game is fairly standard to sub-par but its still entertaining.

Game looks great, feels good, paces itself well. Lots of side quests and things to do but there is a lot more that could be done with exploration and hidden areas (there really isn't much reward for heavily exploring all the cool nooks and crannies. Hopefully there are some updates that polish it up a bit.

Overall, I'm enjoying it a lot, but hoping it gets a bit of the ""No man's Sky"" treatment and actually becomes better through updates."
1609631383,Buggy at release but very very enjoyable.
1609631381,"Despite the horrible press coverage and bugs that have plagued this game, I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who will listen. It's been ridiculously fun and its gorgeous. Cyberpunk has already surpassed my wildest expectations and its only going to get better and more polished. 9.5/10"
1609631397,"Inferior to Deus Ex: Mankind Divided in every conceivable way, except for its scope, and, *arguably*, graphics. Cyberpunk feels like an RPG, but well nigh all choices you make result in the same outcome, so it wears the RPG mantle only as a disguise;  it's pretty much on rails all the way through, apart from a few missions - including the conclusion. The final few hours with the game felt anti-climactic, and the ending left a bitter taste in my mouth. Cyberpunk's still a decent enough game to recommend, mainly for its witty writing, interesting characters, and atmosphere.

Hope you like insects, because there's a lot of bugs left as of v1.06

6.5/10"
1609631288,"There is a lot to say about Cyberpunk 2077, and most of it has already been said, so let me review it without repeating that stuff.

The game was clearly put out before it was done, but I have faith that CDPR will finish the game, and when that time comes, it well be an excellent action game. I am careful not to call this an RPG because somewhere along the mismanaged development cycle most RPG elements have been abandoned, and the story really only allows for some diversion from the beaten paths
All this being said, however, what is already here is excellent when run on proper hardware and when it is all working, which, luckily for me, has been most of the time.
If this sounds interesting to you, I recommend waiting till its cheaper, but the game is fun, and the quality of writing is excellent."
1609631240,if your computer can handle it its a good game   but what specs are needed is kinda a crap shoot it seems
1609631162,"Runs great so far, fascinating characters.  Excited to play the rest."
1609631149,"Yes, there are bugs, but none of them that bad now. Great story."
1609631118,"Ok, just beat the game with a bunch of sidequests in 33 hours.

In overall, I think this is a gem... but an unprocessed one.. Let me explain.

Clearly, CDPR has a vision for this game. And there is clearly a lot of hardwork poured in. The setting, the environment, storyline, characters. They are all there. However, it needs a lot of polish to make you appreciate such vision and hardwork. Immersion is the key issue in a game like this. In every step, you need to believe that you are in the Night City. Just like you feel that you are in Los Santos in GTA V.  However, the lack of polish constantly reminds you that this is a videogame, and an unfinished one.

Therefore, I had to cut the story short and rushed to the ending after 15 hours (which was quite satisfying to be honest). After the patches that CDPR promised, I will start with a new character and hope that I will pour around dozens of hours. Also, I look forward to seeing different endings. Seriously, this game definitely makes you think in those final moments."
1609631038,recommended with RTX ready
1609631018,The game definitely has its fair share of problems but the story is fantastic and the game is fun to play
1609631017,"The single most bugged game I have eevr plyed. Its a discgrace they charge £40 for this, its not even a beta version.. absolute joke.  save teh money form TV commercials and finish teh game properly.. lst game i ever buy from this company."
1609630997,A lot of bugs had higher hopes on this game I really want a refund
1609630927,"Story isn't great, game doesn't feel great to play, driving is terrible, combat is not great.
Glitches make the game slightly more entertaining.
Feels like a bad take on Sleeping dogs"
1609630885,Hope CDPR gonna fix the game after several months. After that and with a couple of DLCs it will be a great thing.
1609630833,.
1609630735,"According to all the haters i should not like this game but I have to say i loved it.
The game has quite some flaws i admit, but i just finished getting all the achievements 
and i had quite a blast. i really fell in love with some of the characters (even johnny)
CDPR is working hard to fix the game and i'm sure when they are done its gonna be even more awesome.
Now gonna start a new lifepath, cya :)"
1609630711,"TL;DR: This game is awesome, despite some of the widely published flaws. The hyped expectations were probably too crazy to attain, but what we're left with is still the best game of 2020, IMO. 

Despite all of the criticism this game has received because of the bugs at launch, I have thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this game. I've noticed the graphics issues and persistent bugs are considerably worse on last gen consoles and under powered PC's. If you fall into these categories, maybe wait to buy if you're worried about it. However, out of my (currently) 85 hours of gameplay, probably 20 hours of that was using my laptop over the holidays, which has an RTX 2060 and an i7-8750. Though it takes a big hit in graphics to switch from my desktop to that laptop, the game itself is still fun as hell to play, even on low settings. That said, even on the overpowered desktop, I have experienced bugs. Mostly they just pulled me out of the immersive experience, but none of them broke the game or prevented my progress; often just leading to a simple chuckle and moving on.

To sum up, with a powerful PC, this game is absolutely beautiful and one of the most engaging/addicting experiences I've had in years. If you have the money (which if you have the aforementioned powerful PC, you probably do) try this game out. If you're patient with the developers with some (mostly) non-game-breaking bugs, you won't be disappointed. The game will only get better as patches and DLC come out. If however you're too worried about the bugs, just wait for reviews on future patches, or for a sale price."
1609975976,"Not currently recommended based on principle for the amount of bugs and poor performance this game comes with. I have no doubt I will change my rating.  It's a AAA title but it's difficult to play because of how often it crashes, which is multiple times in an hour. Sometimes weapons don't equip, the running doesn't work, permanent slow motion, characters stuck in terrain or objects, dialogue that freezes. These contribute to a much more negative experience than anticipated. There is also seemingly lots of missing content, because the world, albeit creatively and impressively designed, often feels very hollow. Character customization and modification is very far behind compared to other games in the genre. I think it will be worth a purchase after content and/or performance updates. The combat and hacking experiences are fun although there is nothing really innovative about this game. The major draw ins for me are the interesting story, dialogue, music, and facial animations. The story is very immersive but I'm not quite sure it's that open-ended based on dialogue choices. It feels like a linear game forced into a more open-world, non-linear game. Weird juxtaposition. The story focus is also similar to FO4, where there is a must do, imperative, highly important thing that needs to be done, NOW, in a very short window of time. But that isn't how the game is supposed to be played. You explore, and do side missions. Again, bad juxtaposition.

Most of my criticisms are still valid however since verifying the integrity of the game's cache, my crashes have mostly stopped. I'm also not entirely sure the slow motion issue was the game's fault or me accidentally pressing the ""tab"" key which places you in quick hack mode indefinitely. The other bugs and the pacing of the story are huge issues. And I had a game breaking bug the other day that magically resolved itself (a script for character action and dialogue did not trigger causing the quest to not finish. It's part of the main storyline.) after I completed a different quest (the quest just completed on its own)"
1609630654,100% worth it. Much better than anything bethesda or activision or EA makes.
1609630630,"good game 
"
1609630575,Really good game!!!
1609630368,"Basically Fallout meets Deus Ex

Buggy and unintuitive inputs can be a nuisance but are presently fixable with mods."
1609630356,it  really feels like gta hahahaha and im having fun doing playing
1609630355,"Glitches have been reported constantly for this game, but in spite of this it truly is one of the best games I've ever played.  The plot is gripping and it simply makes you care about the characters and your choices and their opinions of you.  That fact alone separates it from ""good"" games and elevates it to a great game.  One day they'll iron out all the bugs but don't let those scare you away from such a great experience."
1609630325,"As a sucker for world building, massive map, large scale, story driven, action oriented, choice driven, razor sharp, guns a-blazing, deep lore (I'm running out of played out phrases now) type of games, I fell in love with Cyberpunk from the moment the game booted. 

Following in the spiritual footsteps of such classic explore/side mission galore games like Fallout, Witcher, Assassins Creed, and many others, I found myself playing more side missions than focusing on the main story line. At this point I am around 27 hours into the game and have not progressed the main story after the first chapter and prologue! I've been too engrossed with walking the streets, searching out crime, and making friends (and some enemies) along the way while learning my character, my skills and gun skills. 

Yes, there have been a couple bugs (namely one companion mission I could not get out of the car to fight, and my weapon seem to fire duds as it did no damage) and have had just a few crashes from the game. Since the 1.06 hotfix I have not had any questionable issues. 

Graphically it is a sight. I am running a RTX 2080 Super mated to a i7-9600k and have not have slow down or any frame rate issues with Raytracing turned on. It's been a great experience seeing the game in such splendor. 

Overall, I think it was not as a grand a work as was hoped, but I still have found it very enjoyable and worth the money. When there are more updates and more side stories to do, I believe it will get to the upper echelons of gaming, and create a wonderful full fleshed experience."
1609630270,"Lot of bugs, but it was fun."
1609630263,"Super awesome game, would buy again"
1609630257,One of the best games I've played in a long time
1609630108,"Cyberpunk+High end pc=Good game that could have a few more features. Barbershop, car customization, police interaction."
1609630006,Skyrim is no longer the standard. This game and the stories within are amazing!
1609629961,"Overall, Cyberpunk is worth playing if you can get over small frustrations. 
I really enjoyed the story and combat doesn't feel repetitive as the missions (at least on the main questline) are pretty varied. There are also many different ways to develop V's skills, whether you want to be really stealth-based, kill your enemies by hacking, or simply use guns. One of my favorite things about the game is the characters: they're all very likable. Even minor characters have their own personalities and it makes the game feel more real. This differs, in my opinion, from a lot of other RPGs; I never feel like I can connect with or relate to characters. Finally, the world is beautiful and even if you can't run it on the highest graphic settings, it's still stunning. 
Personally, I didn't have any major bugs that prevented me from continuing with the story or couldn't be solved with loading an older save and repeating a little. My only other complaint is that dialogue choices really don't matter. They change what characters' replies are, but with the exception of a few, they don't change what ending you'll get.
That being said, I would still recommend the game because of how good the world and story are, and simply put, it's an entertaining game that you'll get many hours out of."
1609629943,Pog game
1609629939,It is a nice game but we all know that there is glitches but if you dont look at the glitches the game is nice and have a good sstory
1609629894,"Bug everywhere, unplayable"
1609629887,"If you are running a 1080Ti or better, and can look past some bugs and having to restart the game every now and then, and are into the Cyberpunk / Blade Runner genre then you will have a good time."
1609629839,good game
1609629728,"JUST BUY IT! ignore all that crap you heard, buy it! it does so many things right, i love thats it's more on the RPG side than the shooter side. makes you think about your combat and equipment settings. the attention to details in the city, cars, fabrics, like oh my gosh just please buy it, it does so many things right it's hard to pin point 1 or 2 things i loved everything just buy it buy it, you won't regret it!"
1609629722,So buggy!
1609629673,"Other than launch bugs, great game."
1609629647,25 hours in and no major glitches.
1609629630,"I've resisted finishing the game because I'm not ready to leave the world of Night City yet! Game runs fine on my not-top tier PC, couple of minor glitches here and there. Cant wait for more Cyberpunk (DLC/etc/etc)!"
1609629520,"I had no hype for this game before it came out, hell i hadn't even so much as watched the trailer. This game is the most buggy game ive ever played and ive played Assassin's Creed Unity upwards of 5 times, my first 1 hour in this game had more bugs that all 5 playthroughs of AC Unity combined (not exageration). It is very fair to say that i experienced a major bug ever hour or so with small bugs inbetween, not even mentioning the shitty optimization. I have a decent PC, nothing ground breaking but i can run Jedi Fallen Order at Highest graphics at a constant 60fps, however with cyberpunk 2077 some times i would struggle to hit 40 on medium. What i have just told you sound really bad right? so why did i give it a thumbs up? why do i recomend cyberpunk 2077, I recomend it because under all of the glaring issuses is a game i happily spent 70 hours in. The world, The story,  the characters, and world building are some of the best i have ever seen. The gameplay is a bit clunky but its still fun with the amount of weapons there are and the driveing was also very fun. The writing in this game is also really quite good, many of the side missions along with main missions feature ACTUAL moral descions rather than just the good option and bad option, many descions are caked in moral grey area, each choice with ups and downs. I don't think Cyberpunk 2077 is a bad game at all, in fact i think it is a solid game and i do recomend it just not now, save your money and buy the game when its finally in a playable state, and once most of the major bugs have been patched out."
1609629510,fun video game
1609629474,"I have truly enjoyed my time in this game.
Specs: 

i5 9600k
GTX 1060 6GB

People have leveled a lot of complaints about Cyberpunk 2077, and while I think some of them are fair, especially on last gen consoles, I have found that the engaging story, incredibly tight core gameplay loops, and the engrossing environment of Night City and the surrounding areas are great enough to overcome some of the other issues of the game. with my hardware, I cannot experience all of the visual wonder that this game has to offer, but even with having to scale down my resolution to 1080 from 1440, and with most of the settings on medium and low, with a few exceptions being on high and ultra, I believe it still looks phenomenal. I have a steady frame rate of somewhere around 40 to 50 with very infrequent drops depending on where I am in the city. 

All of the hardware related items aside, I have been fully engrossed in V's life and struggle in NC. I'll find myself thinking, 'Okay, time to do this story mission', then becoming immediately distracted by a spontaneous crime happening nearby where I, of course, have to intervene, then get a call from a fixer about a nearby gig that I, of course, can't just pass it by, followed by finding my favorite monk in a new place to lead me in some digital meditation. Next thing I know, 3 hours have gone by, I've leveled up multiple times, I'm trying out new perks and looking at what my new street cred level has unlocked in the nearest ripperdoc location. It is just really, really fun to play. 

Are there bugs? Yes. Totally. Do said bugs keep me from having a great time playing this game? Not at all. I haven't dedicated this much time to a video game in many years, and I'm loving it. Highly recommend."
1609629462,cool
1609631002,"[i] In Night City you can be cum [/i]

[spoiler] Bruh and the best game of the year at the same time moment [/spoiler]"
1609629362,Nice game
1609629361,"I was one of the people who watched the 2013 trailer, followed the progress, and paid early for the game.  Oddly i was not a big Cyberpunk fan.  I played Shadowrun back in the day, but I knew of Cyberpunk genre which I admit shares themes with many things I enjoy.  I know I had assumptions, and expectations, like many others when the game finally did release after delays.  I did not seem to experience the bugs that others did, or I am more forgiving of some things.  I quite honestly wished more games played like Cyberpunk 2077 has for me so far.  I was enjoying everything in my Nomad life path gameplay.  I hope to try the other life path options, but I do find it hard to stop my current session.  I look forward to what there is ahead, and what the future dlc might add.  Multiplayer might be a pipe dream, but I would even enjoy a coop option that just allows a freeplay in Night City with random gigs.

Having fun, and looking forward to more."
1609629327,"Buggy game, but still a fun ride!  It will only get better over time."
1609629325,Super fun. Will play through more than once for sure.
1609629322,Its good make sure you're saving often though because sometimes a glitch can ruin gameplay but gameplay is worth it ;)
1609629302,Despite all the bugs still innovative and fun to play.
1609629285,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! The story is amazing, the voice acting is better than most games, the city lights and atmosphere (from a distance) all make this game look very fun. However, in playing the game you will find a variety of bugs which will get in your way of completing it. I've spent the past two hours on two side quests, not because they're difficult in any fashion, but because the games quest tracker won't update, telling me I must complete things I've already completed. Reloading saves does not work, beating the quest again in a different way won't fix it. This game is fucked, all smoke and mirrors, the people recommending others to buy it are only distracted by the great story telling, but I wouldn't spend $80 on a game that literally has only that going for it, every other game element is so bugged it makes the game a chore to play."
1609629199,I enjoy this game. There is a ton of customization and million things to do in the city besides the main quest line. It's one of those games you can spend hours playing but make zero progress in the main story line. There are few bugs in the gameplay like people randomly appearing or people sitting in invisible chairs but a lot of these issues  can be fixed in the near future. Great game and looking forward to completing.
1609629077,"So many bugs, LOVED all Witchers, but this game, a real shame really."
1609629071,fun
1609629032,"not engaging, terribly optimized, not what they promised, get in 1-2 years when it is good"
1609628950,Game looks pretty if you have a good enough pc. but the gameplay and especially the AI are trash. Completely immersion breaking. The driving is also terrible with a mouse and keyboard. Biggest disappointment in a long time.
1609628853,please fix the fucking game
1609628674,"Been playing this for a short amount of time, encountered a few bugs, but nothing gamebraking.

Loving the story and the gameplay!"
1609628637,Game looks great and runs fine for the most part (60 FPS on medium to high settings @ 1440p). I can see where this game would be less enjoyable for anybody with a mid to lower end PC. Only complaints are the number of crashes/bugs I experienced so far and hopefully CDPR will address them in the near future.
1609653130,"Don't read the reviews, just give it a go! 

The game has its fare share of flaws but there is nothing like it. Dive in with an open mind and you're guaranteed to have fun (if your PC is fast enough). You can refund it within two hours of playing anyway."
1609628558,"This game is a delight to behold from 2020 but currently with all the bugs and bad press behind it, it has not been doing too well. I have found with my gaming experience while playing it that if you have the minimum it will lag very badly, one of my RAM sticks weren't properly seated making it to the point where I only had 8 GBs of RAM running. I found out that after plugging it back in I was able to run the game reasonably well. The game still has rendering issues of the faces from distances, Cars out in the wasteland and even sometime game breaking bugs like when you try to finish a quest and the person never comes over.  Overall The game has made me happy to play, has given me a good story and a great view of the corporation dystopia of the world CDProject Red intended for us to view. A lot of gamers may have had high expectations for this game after forcefully ripping it out of the oven not fully baked and now wonder why the developers dont have the fixs already pushed out. The year of 2020 has been bad and put much pressure on this company to bring this game out to the marketplace and people act like it was the developers fault for it. They do have some points to be blamed at like the lying of Old Gen Consoles and barely being able to support minimum spec computers  but the only thing we are able to do is back up the company till they can bring out fully what we expected with the patches and allowing for the older specs be able to also play as well. We as gamers need to gain the patience we once had back when Skyrim came out, we also need to understand that CDProjekt Red is not pulling a fast one like Bethesda with throwing out a half-baked Game, Leaving it Half-Baked for years, and monitizing off of it from micro-transactions. Think of this game as an investment like No Man Sky."
1609628510,"Really great RPG, lots of exploration and side missions. Driving isnt the best, but honestly this game was everything I hoped it would be."
1609628467,This is a really good game with some major issues. I hope they are able to work those issues in the near future.
1609628465,Its cool
1609628442,"A thing of beauty,wil never fade away."
1609628243,"Don't listen to the haters. There are some minor bugs, but the game looks beautiful on my GTX 1060 (a pretty old graphics card.) The story is amazing, and the gameplay is fun. Lots of content too, currently 58 hours in."
1609628227,"Thoughts:

-It's pretty Cyberpunk-y
- I'm running around with cyber-enhanced fists beating the justice into Night City. With the sneak skills, street brawler skills and double jump it feels like a batman simulator. 
- There's a bug where if you walk along the curb of the streets at just the right angle it launches you down the street at about the same speed as a speeding car.
- There are bugs, I'd compare the amount and frequency of the bugs to the ones I'd experienced while playing Skyrim. Specifically, the pathing, collisions, and objects spawning on screen and falling to the ground.
- The police will aggro if you stand in front of them for too long (adds to the immersion?)
- If you run and gun it can feel like playing Borderlands
- Cover is important for pretty much any build.
- ""Hacking"" is very rewarding in combat and can, along with sneak skills, be a viable combat build.
- I see a lot of Witcher 3 quest and loot mechanics in this game.
- I could see myself picking this up again in 5-7 years because of the amount of time I've enjoyed playing it."
1609628088,it's rough around the edges. In time it will be something beautiful
1609628074,"Solid RPG. Improvements could be made, was worth playing through on a higher-end PC."
1609628069,if you lower your expectations about the game its ok. but it should only cost 40 dollars max.
1609627976,amazing
1609627812,The flaws become insignificant compared to the true next gen experience it offers.
1609631587,"I just finished the game and I gotta say this was a fantastic rollercoaster and I can't wait for story DLCs.

1. Story
 --> great and fitting for the cyberpunk setting

2. Characters 
--> the real strength of the game, the main cast for major and side quests as well as romance is simply fantastic
--> well written and artistically designed
--> great voice acting
--> you'll wish to return to them similar to games like Mass Effect or The Witcher

3. Gameplay
--> quite a few ways to solve combat sections
--> meelee, stealth, different ways to play with guns, hack skills as a substiute for a mage of fantasy settings
--> the minus here is that you can become overpowered quickly if you do all side content, on normal difficulty you will have no problems
--> dumb AI
--> I played with mantis blades and even though it became easy with the right skills it still was super fun to go through a lot of enemies
--> don't ignore the Cold Blood skill tree IT'S AMAZINGLY FUN if you like power fantasy in combat

4. Graphics & Glitches
--> looks amazing with RTX effects, but very demanding
--> you have to fiddle around to get the right settings for your PC
--> standard settings are not super helpful
--> you should currently quicksave a lot to avoid bug issues, also stealth gameplay kinda requires quick saving anyways
--> there are quite a lot of graphical glitches, but mostly nothing game breaking

All in all, if you play games for the atmosphere, story and characters, this is for you. It actually has some very similar strengths and weaknesses as The Witcher 3 in some regards. I personally loved it!"
1609627662,"Buy it on sale, like 80% off and leave it in your library like the rest of your games, untouched."
1609627653,"Went into this with no expectations, having not bought into the hype (probably because I didn't play the Witcher games til this summer, therefore I had no preconceptions of CDPR's products), and I've honestly been enjoying it quite a lot. I love the world and lore, the characters and weapons, even the music on the radio stations seem to fit the rest of the world like a glove. My PC runs it very well, and the only bugs I've had have been very minor, usually vehicle related. 
Like so many other games, Cyberpunk has a lot of potential for growth, and I hope it gets the second coat of paint and the polish it deserves. 
Enjoy chooms."
1609627609,"It's pretty dang good, needs polish"
1609627546,"I cannot support this game, I have played it, There are bugs, it is not horrible, but it is still unacceptable. a promise ""when it is ready"" was not upheld. But that aside, this suffers from the worst thing possible, shitty endings. They all suck, horrendously, hours building relationships, doing quests for endings that do it no justice. No matter what setup you do, no matter what cyberware you save up for, or skill trees you go down there is no effect on the greater story, no mention at all. Much in the style of Bioware and Mass effect you invest countless hours for unfulfilling endings, so much for their promises. Dont buy this game, the gross dissappointment is not worth it."
1609627537,"It's a solid game and would be a raving review for an Early Access title. If it were a different developer, the hate wouldn't be so white hot and we saw the same shoddy launch gut punch titles. Play time is not accurate as a lot of it was racked afk or in the background.

They'll clean it up and it will look amazing and smooth when it's humming but it should've never left launch in the state it's in with CDPR's reputation to uphold. Still, I highly recommend it on a sale or when they get their mess in order.

The pros are plentiful, and the cons are around too. A few notables drawbacks since I'm obviously already recommending it these don't net negative:

Physics in cars is a mess. GTA5 had doors closing on their own you turn the wheel right. In this, open doors don't swing when you're driving and slamming into a car on a motorcycle doesn't usually throw you the way they should. 

No audio of lore, I don't mind reading but there is some content that would be just as well experienced with voice actors so we can listen to the tapes as we move around.

Limited cybernetics: Yes, you can add implants to your body but it's entirely unsatisfying. There's no animation, period of time getting adjusted to a new limb, or otherwise recognition that you've just cut off your legs and installed bionic ones. Just a transaction at an npc vendor, same as a drink. This is so disappointing considering this is the hallmark of the genre.

No customization of cars, weapons, or clothing: It's the damn future, did they lose paint? Making a space or vehicle your own seems an easy addition.

Inventory management is okay but one time suck is the inability to disassemble a weapon in the world directly. Instead, you have to fill up your back and disassemble every...item....individually as there's no way to break them down in one go.

Too easy on very hard. I stopped upgrading and only do so when I hit a door I can't open. I prefer to play games as hard as possible so advancements simply clear a barrier I can't pass and nothing more. I never hit a ceiling here so I don't upgrade to avoid becoming more overpowered than I already am. I love being able to hack from a distance but there should be some better countermeasures in place after enemies start dropping."
1609629799,"Worst performing action adventure game I've played in 16 years of playing video games.
Gameplay loop / progression very similar to ""generic Far Cry / Ubi open world game""

1609627398,"I really like this game, it's so fun honestly.
It really gets the cyberpunk theme going, the world is beautiful and full of detail, they just need to fix the bugs and it can be called an amazing game.
I don't recommend buying this if your computer isn't mid to high tier, because it won't run as good

1609627349,"A lot of fun, despite the flaws. I was hoping for a really immersive experience and the bugs unfortunately pull you out of the experience a lot, but I never encountered anything game breaking. If anything the bugs made me laugh so much that it became almost endearing in a way."
1609627309,"Yes, the game has bugs, but on a moderate system (6th gen i7 w/ RTX 2070) it runs fairly well with ray tracing at 1440p and extremely well without ray tracing enabled. Beyond that, it's just a very fun game. The missions are interesting and fun, and the character missions are great with solid writing and cool characters. The game is highly worth playing now and I plan on re-playing when the bugs are worked out and the performance is improved. Worth the $79 CDN for the content, music, design and scale of the game."
1609627142,"I have ploughed through the game and not for a single second seen something glitch out, even with decent PC.
Leaving the glitches aside, the factions in the game and the whole of night city don't really feel anything special. The enemy AI and crowd in the city are super basic and feel dumb.
Characters are interesting but V is one-dimensional, with limited choices. The lifepaths provide no different experiences as V ends up with same options for ending.
Also I love Keanu but Johnny Silverhand feels uninspired and interesting. 

Story - 5/10
Gameplay - 4/10
Performance - 3/10 (Needs fixing)
Characters - 7/10
World - 5/10

The game feels incomplete, leaving the bugs aside and feels rushed. Unfortunate.

1609627060,I'm really enjoying this game and there are not too many bugs.  None have been game breaking.
1609626987,"Side quests and gigs keep you busy for hours, if not days. Main story is good too, just not as addictive."
1609626816,"Buggy, however most of the time a quick search on the web will result with a fix. Very good story, and a ton of side quests and stuff to keep me glued to the screen."

1609626526,"Cyberpunk 2077 isnt without its flaws, and there is some unfulfilled potential which hasn't been realised.  That being said, on a basic level it is already a very good game.  CDPR have a very good track record of providing comprehensive post-release support (which this game requires due to the bugs) and free DLC.

One of the problems with a game like this is that I always tend to compare it to existing open world 'epic' RPGs which (typically) have years worth of DLC, patches and mods behind them.  As such I tend to find I get a bit of rose-tinted glasses when comparing cyberpunk to some of these games.

As it currently stands if you are a fan of assassins creed style games or the witcher 3 and like the genre of cyberpunk, then you will like this game.  If you are coming more from fallout 4 or skyrim and expect more of an open world exploration then you may not be as happy.  Regardless this is an excellent game and I've already sunk 200+ hours into it."
1609626629,"Highlights are Story and Graphics, pretty to look at and they spent a lot of effort in the narrative
Its ok in its gameplay but not terribly diverse.
Downsides are the lacking in options/diversity, they promised a bit here and I'd say they didn't deliver. And the bugs, theres quite a bit, but nothing show stopping (I mean, it has caused me to need to reload an autosave once or twice, but not much lost). Even funny at times, reminding me of Skyrim bugs and glitches. Though I've seen others complain of more painful bugs. 
Overall, I'd recommend but it wouldn't be a bad idea to wait for a sale and/or more fixes."
1609626508,"The game is incomplete. 
they spent years building just the world, and then in a few months threw in some NPCS and story. 
it was all hype.
cyberpunk 2077 is a 90s version of what 2020 would look like.

ready player one meets alita battle angel, meets judge dred, that is the world.

you cannot customise the character after the creation, you cannot customise cars, you cannot customise weapons, you have bugs where you cannot chose the options for responding to questions.
there is an illusion of choice for lines of dialogue. 

5/10 at best. i had low expectations, but this is a slap in the face. 
i played this game on PC
Ryzen 5600X cpue, RTX 3070 GPU. got it smooth running. 

bugs galore, but the bugs werent the problem. i felt lied to. nothing they said would be in the gmae was actually in the game. 
The characters mouths dont even move when they speak half the time.


5/10.  
i did not preorder this game, but you should not buy it. they have enough money to fix it."
1609626505,"32 hours in and the game is sweeeeeet! Haven't encountered many bugs so far. (Since 31st December 2020)
+Graphics are 11 out of 10 (maxed out @ 1440p with RTX 3090)
+Crafting system is nice. You can also upgrade your old weapons/armor, if you don't want to change them.
+Gunplay is great, weapon sounds are on point also. Makes you feel powerful when you pop away!
+Movement: You can climb, vault, slide and other shit with mods.. awesome!
+Dialogue and music.. well damn 11/10 again

1609626464,buggy but good
1609626458,good
1610063026,"Really loving what the teams working on the City building, Acting (voice or otherwise) and the Music did... 
Basically the art teams (Top Job!)

But that's it everything else tho is either half-assed, a mess or just missed opportunities to do it right. 

Very sad to be honest, considering the writing wasn't bad and all. And the 6 endings all had a message to convey. (technically 7 but one was every similar with only 2 minor differences easily missed)

Can't help but question what the hell was the rush in releasing it in 2020 other then being 2020... as per Cyberpunk 2020.

And look at the dreck the Execs managed to put the Dev Team in with their 2020 release decision... so Dum Dum. 
Not to mention marketing for over-hyping the dreck out of this games features (lack of features rather), something that the Tech teams just couldn't deliver on or just simply got pulled because Execs logic.

[b] Personally Like the game however really can't recommend it. Wait another year before you bother with this one, hopefully enough things get sorted out.[/b]"
1609626426,"Game is great but felt it could've been in a better state if covid hadn't slowed them down. Not a huge fan of the beginning of the narrative where you put on a path with no real difference than the other life paths, like Jackie becoming your best friend no matter what. Gameplay is fun so I can't complain there and the rest of the story had me actually listening to what everyone was saying. Going on my second build and I'm still having fun, I can't wait to see what they add after they fix a couple things."
1609626371,"Don't believe those on the negative hype train. The game has some minor issues but is more than playable and fixes are coming thick and fast though I'm still running 1.04 by choice.

An incredible innovative game as is and it's only going to get better!

Amazing (FREE) soundtrack, voice acting, graphics, animation, gameplay mechanics, enguaging philosophy/storylines.

Plus CDPR have principles and should be supported. No DRM (except Steam in this version), No Microtransactions, etc etc. Forced to release early but it's not nearly as bad as all the hypers are making out even on last gen, i suspect a campaign against CDPR is well underway and many are unwittingly playing their role as pawns in this agenda."
1609626370,I like this game.  Even with the issues it is still a solid purchase at $60 and easily one of the better games of 2020.
1609626228,"look a lot of the technical issues are whatever, but this is still a fantastic game. the issues will be fixed here, just give it time🧘"
1609626162,Good game i like the story alot.
1609626112,this game had way more potential
1609626100,"at roughly 100 hours played, besides the countless bugs I've encountered I would still say you should buy this game and try it out for yourself."
1609626051,"yeah it's got bugs, but they don't detract too much from the fact it's one of the best games to come out in a long time, amazing depth of story and so well done. love it."
1609625991,"I'll sum it up as a great game that wasn't finished.

Not just referring to bugs, the game has [b]many features that are awesome but lack enough content [/b] and development to make them interesting. Feels like they did all the heavy lifting to make a great game, and then stopped fleshing out as deadlines crept up.

Time will tell on this one."
1609625959,press F if your save got deleted. :(
1609625823,"At the time of writing this review, the game is a disgrace."
1609625772,"I didn't quite buy into the hype for this game like some people, so going in I had fairly low expectations. The brief summary is that this is a game heavily centred around its story, for better and worse. It's a fairly great story, fun to play through with some really great characters. Once it's done however, there isn't much left for you. There are a few side quests that are of the same or even better quality to the main plot (Protip, any side quests that don't have the gig: prefix are usually the side quests with substantial content). Gigs, as they call the clutter missions that are there to give you eddies and XP are at least flavoured well. Shooting is solid, nothing special. The world building is great, night city was really brought to life, as long as you're just looking at it. This game didn't quite turn out to be the immersive sim that I expected and hoped for. Regardless it's a fine setting and does the job.

If you're not salivating to play a cyberpunk Action-RPG shooter then wait for a sale. Otherwise, there are worse things to drop your money on.

Also yeah it's buggy as hell, it's on the level of New Vegas at launch. Take that as you will."
1609625704,"I've sunk around 52 hours into this game so far with most of my time taken up by side missions. From reading other reviews, it is obvious that there are issues on different platforms, mainly PS4 and Xbox one. From a PC perspective, this game is amazing. The graphics are stunning (aside from a few, relatively minor bugs), the audio is amazing however the writing and overall design of night city is what blows me away. It's not as gripping or immersive as the witcher III but you'll still have an absolutely brilliant time."
1609625688,"Despite the glitches, this is a great game. The story is very immersive, and has become one of my favorite games."
1609625565,العبة ممتازه و ممتعة القصة جميلة و شيقه لم اوجه مشاكل من ناحية قلجات او بيقس
1609625536,"This game is one of the best games I have ever played. The graphics are very good, and the story is very good and the game is very fun to play. I recommend this game 100%, all day, any day."
1609625525,"For all the flak it gets, it was an enjoyable experience for me. 

Some bugs, none excessive."
1609625516,"The actual best PC roleplaying-1st-person-shooter.
To be honest, you need a decent PC with raytracing capability to get a full immersive playing experience. If you own one, you get a giant map full of different settings, incredible views and the full cyperpunk feeling.
Be aware, there are a few bugs, but only 1-2 preventing mission goals.
The huge difference between GTA and Cyperpunk? In Cyperpunk you can go inside many buildings and dive deep into the cyperpunk universe. The level of detail is incredible, GTA only is a bit ahead when driving around. But combat, crafting, leveling up, story line..cyperpunk is the new king."
1609625459,"To be honest. This is probably the best! or if not! the coolest Cyberpunk-Theme game that there is at this point. Everything is there.
That's all there is to say about it,
Buy it it's fucking worth it.
**Minus the Bugs & etc,etc**
The perfect game is here. Just gotta believe in 'em. I know they will grow it up to be a Master Piece.
It's god damn CDPR for god sake!"
1609625462,"Reviewing with patch version 1.06:

I think my biggest problem with this game is that I was never particularly compelled to do anything other than story quests/ side quests. I think the open world/ NPC AI is very underdeveloped compared to other games like Red Dead Redemption 2 or even GTA IV or V and the world feels kind of lifeless to me. Art direction and visuals are absolutely superb though.

That being said, I think the game has a relatively good foundation for Night City as a whole, and CDPR could potentially add improvements over time. I don't necessarily know how viable this is considering how buggy the existing game is, and I feel that needs to be prioritized first.

Overall, I think this game needs a lot of improvement to get to what the devs originally promised it would be. Personally, I think Witcher 3 is CDPR's best work yet."
1609625377,"Took my time and enjoyed it greatly. 
It's got amazing aesthetics and a great soundtrack, A story that grips you in and makes you think about your decisions. 

And the perk/stat system is a absolute delight to play around with. 
Am writing this review after my first time finishing the game, I say first time since I will definitely play it through many many more times to try different builds."
1609625303,"Story is junk, graphics are junk unless you have a decked out rig. Combat is worse than Skyrim, honestly playing this game makes me want to play every other mediocre open world rpg I've played over the last 10 years. This makes Ubisoft open world games seem in depth. Save your money, buy on sale or don't."
1609625293,"Its a really fun game. as of writing it has a tonne of bugs and unfinished bits, but its mostly of the fun kind. and there is a lot of content. could use some polishing but i still had a lot of fun in the game."
1609625262,Great Game Overall. small glitches here and there but nothing game breaking. Game could use a harder difficulty.
1609625244,Amazing story!
1609625211,The game is soooo broken i literally have trees popping up that i can see through buildings and is very glitchy i have been sent flying and people have walked in walls and people getting messed up when they talk.
1609706324,"Seemingly infinite number of bugs that destroy immersion and can even be game-breaking. The story isn't incredibly engaging and I actually enjoyed the side-quests more. There isn't nearly as much content as the Witcher 3 had. I completed almost all side-quests in my first play-through and, at the time, I assumed that I was still relatively early in the game when in reality, I was on the last main-story mission. If I opted to not do the side-quests, I probably could have beaten the game in less than 15 hours; the other 20 hours I have as of writing this were entirely side-quests that were optional. In my opinion, a game that costs me CAD$79.99 should give me a little more playtime than 35 hours, especially considering I've done the majority of the content that's offered (aside from every fixer mission, as those can become a little tedious).

Overall, quite disappointed. The game is fun and has the ability to draw you back into playing every time you log off, but the lack of content was a big slap to the face. Definitely expected more from CDPR considering they made the Witcher 3 which is immensely better than Cyberpunk 2077, in my opinion.

3.5/5."
1609625094,Apart from  the glitches kick ass story!
1609625065,Yes Good
1609625020,"This game has a lot of flaws, but I had a ton of fun despite those flaws.  First, I'll start off with the bad:
1) The NPCs are dumb as nails
2) the game has a lot of bugs...but none are particularly game breaking and are usually just minor annoyances, and sometimes funny

Now for the good, and there are a lot of them:
1) The side missions are all fantastic...don't miss out on them.  They are all unique and has some really fun times
2) The gun play can be quite satisfying, and there are a large variety of weapons in the game that make it fun to play around with
3) For my play through, I focused on hacking and cyberware and the end game is truely satisfying....I felt like a god by the end and it was very fun play around with the enemies
4) The story is satisfying, and I really liked interacting with johnny silverhands

This is probably my favorite game I played in 2020, and I can definitely recommend.  However, you will need a powerful computer to get this running well.  I was on a Ryzen 3600x and a 3080 and most of the game ran between 60-80fps with occasional dips in to the 40s running at max settings with DLSS at balanced and Ray Tracing at Ultra."
1609625009,"Game of The Year 2020
yes, there is quite a lot of bugs in the game, but 9/10 of these are just funny

1609624755,"Reminds me of Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines, plenty of bugs but there is a great game in there trying to get out!"
1609624745,"At some point it stopped counting my hours, but i ended with about 80 hours total, did all side quests, and ran through the main story, easily could've taken my time and stretched beyond that. I don't know much about the console experience, the the pc experience has been fantastic to me. Sure there are plenty of visual bugs, but i didn't really encounter much until about 30 hours in, ran mixed settings on a 5700xt/3600x at 1440p to get about 50 fps average without FidelityFX/CAS, it pegged my gpu usage and ran around 79 C, but overall ran fine. I had one complete crash around 50 hours, after restarting it never crashed again, various visual bugs were T-posing enemies in the first few days, gun in jackies head, personal car spawning in other cars, etc. Also the enemies are pretty dumb, can walk through most of the game with maxed out intelligence/legendary quickhacks on the hardest difficulty.
Overall a good experience for me."
1609624701,"I wish there was a ""neutral"" option. Because the game is okay. It is fun to play, it has an interesting story that is very meaningful to people who know the lore (we've been waiting many a year to know what actually happened to Johnny Silverhand), but other than that, the game is simply not up to standard in pretty much any and all regard. You will get your money's worth of fun out of it, but it is nothing more than an average game (in some regards, sadly: well below average) that tells a compelling story once Johnny Silverhand hits the scene."

1609624074,Aside from all the bugs and glitches... this game is amazing. The story is so interesting and not for a single second I played did I ever find the want to hit c to skip dialogue. I have just beat the game and intend to keep playing it over and over again just so I can appreciate the hard work and amazing story. Thank you CD Project Red for a great story.
1609624062,"Really fun game so far. 19 Hours in and I have only experienced a few very minor visual bugs ( running game version 1.06 )

I run Ultra preset ( no ray tracing ) with DLSS set to "" Quality "" at 70-75 Fps on an I7 8700k with a 4.8 ghz all core overclock paired with 32 gigs of 3600mhz ram and a RTX 2070 non-super overclocked to 2 ghz max boost @ 1440p resolution. 

Cpu usage is only around 30-50 % so you should NOT need an 8700k or faster to run the game.

Story is really good so far - Make sure to do the side quests because it really helps to flesh out the game.
I find it hard to put down, kind of like when you are watching a good movie but have to use the bathroom. You keep waiting for a slow spot but he story keeps coming hot and heavy and you just keep thinking I can hold it a little longer. 

I have found the main story NPC's to be engaging and l have found myself caring about them and there back story's. So far for me the story writing has been top notch, It is giving me the same feeling I had back in 2010 when Fallout New Vegas first came out ( A very buggy game itself when it first came out ).
Just like I loved wandering the Mojave and exploring every nook cranny and side quest, I also find myself enjoying exploring Night City. Taking on the role of V a good hearted Nomad just trying to survive the brutal capitalist world of a dystopian cybernetic future who unwittingly got caught up in some crazy ass Sh*t.

I have been playing with an Xbox One Controller and the controls are quite good in my opinion. Default button layout is intuitive and I can do everything in-game with the controller. I did try keyboard and mouse but found the mouse movement to be twitchy and the default key layout to be a little strange so I recommend an Xbox controller If you have one.

It is a very pretty game if you have the PC Specs to run on Ultra or better. I really like the character Animations they are very lifelike. 

With 3 different character types ( City / Nomad / Corp ) and 2 genders to choose from I can see myself giving this game a couple of play thoughts to see how the story changes.

Overall a very enjoyable game worth the cost if you like games like Fallout 3 / New Vegas IMO."
1609624044,"its fun
"
1609623988,"The game has minor cosmetic issues here and there, but not to the extent it takes away from the content of the game. This being an opinion based off PC game play of course. Its unfortunate the drama revolving around this title is keeping people away, the story is very good. Id would suggest a friend pick it up and hold out for updates. Its great as for what it is now and will only get better."
1609623948,"03/01/2021: Buggy can't enjoy it with seeing trees and having to save and reload a heap near the end of game to be able to progress. Also after finishing the game and continuing my next ""gig"" no reward was given and the main quest is a pest that it stays on screen even though it was already done. There is a few legendary items that can't be broken down or sold and some of us people are sticklers of clean inventory. Story line is pretty good but after finishing and splitting wtf is johnny still around for why not a different method to talk to him like why the fuzzy pains when he ain't there to be doing it."
1609623923,"Is this game a religious experience: No 
Is CP77 the greatest game ever made: No
Is CD Projekt Red now a worse company than EA: No
Is CP77 crafting enjoyable: No
Did the CP77 change gaming for ever: No
Did CP77 cure the Rona and save 2020: No
Did CP77 launch more buggy the Fallout 76: No
Did CP77 have more content cut then No man's Sky: No

I love this game, I played on an old GTX970 with only one one of its cooling fan working. I've never crashed and almost all bugs could be fixed by saving and reloading except for one side quest that broke. Most problems I have with the game can be patched or added back in and I'm looking forward to the DLC. Many other AAA games have launched with more bugs and with more content cut and received far less backlash then CPDR, this to me feels more like cancel culture. I've played regular and modded Bethesda games for years, CP77 is a calming vacation compared to them. 

I do wish the game was longer though I understand why CDPR made the CP77 more digestible. Witcher 3 is a game fans love yet the achievement for finishing the game on any difficulty has a 26.5% on Steam, for a game people love not many seemed to have actually finished it. CP77 lacks depth in certain areas but Night City is a fun cyberpunk playground well worth experiencing."
1609623884,Cool good game
1609623863,"After 40h I finished Cyberpunk's main story. I still have V's and Johnny's and a lot of the sides in Night City. Overall I feel like I barely touched the game and I love it so far. Need to play more to get more endings!

Bugs? Barely any. Some visual bugs which didn't affect my gameplay. I didn't experience anything I saw on Reddit or other videos. I just don't have that many bugs. Yes the AI is not amazing. It's lame sometimes or doesn't really work but I don't care that much as I'm used to have the same AI quality from Ubisoft games.

I would recommend this game to anyone with a decent PC (I played on high graphics on RTX 2080 with RTX medium and DLSS on balance, 1080p), not consoles for now.

If you don't have a decent CPU and latest graphics card, GET ONE, otherwise game-play will hit you down to less than 20 fps which is a pain to play with."
1609623404,Finally ZEROED the last boss. 'Is not the PREEM CHROME promised. Ppl who made them release early should be FLATLINED. Cheers CHOOMS.~(Game did not affect the way i talk in any way.)
1609623334,"Bit buggy so far but runs fine on my rig. Bugs are mostly animation issues or mundane items clipping into the ground, nothing game breaking"
1609623322,"Loving the game 10/10. Graphics are top notch but the story is on another level! Definitely CDPR's best work yet. Forgive the occasional bug and you're going to have a good time!

Game will be 20/10 when patched."
1609623317,Good game but wish it had less bugs
1609623536,This game is unplayable by Act 2 with glitches and bugs. Good thing I was doing all the side missions before moving forward to find out the game is completely broken and steam won't refund me my money for the broken game that they are allowing people to buy on their platform. Shame on me for not researching and making sure that a game that could be bought on steam was playable beyond 1/4 way through the game. Do yourself a favor stay away from this game and make sure that you are not giving your money away to steam for a broken game.
1609623162,I had a lot of fun playing this. I haven't had a dull moment yet.
1609623161,Fun game from a non-gamer
1609623051,I've never seen a game lie this full of bugs. Practically unplayable at this moment.
1609623041,"Game with amazing potential.

I have been anticipating this game for ages and it's very promising.
I'm running a GTX 1080 Ti, i7 4700K, 32GB RAM and comparable other hardware. The framedrops (even on low and medium graphics) are insane. Visual bugs are constant and all over the place. I have encountered few gamebreaking issues (like falling off the map, or being blocked by NPCs stopping me from progressing), but the visuals are a huge annoyance. I'm certain it will get fixed in the future, but right now I can't recommend the game. Buy it in a couple of months."
1609622994,fun
1609622960,Waited so long for this game and it was a let down in almost every way.
1609622924,"I will recommend this game simply because at the end of the day and through all of the glitches, I enjoyed it.

For what it's worth, this game is very beautiful. You can really tell which parts of the core game was focused on and which parts were shoved off to the side or rushed through. I was able to get in to the storyline and follow it all the way to the end -- multiple times -- which is not something I do very often. The combat is well executed and blades are pleasing to play with. However, I feel there is still a lot lacking from this game which I hope that CDPR will fix in the coming months.


Here are some of the glitches I noted down while playing. There was A LOT that I missed -- This game is buggy as fuck. There were a lot of performance issues but I won't get in to those. I apologize for any spoilers if any.

Game version: 1.06 hotfix

Missions:
- During ""Transmission"", Brigette's voice is not audible. Once in cyberspace(BBS) her voice is audible again. This happens randomly during other missions as well -- luck of the draw it seems.
- During ""Pyramid Song"" when you venture underwater there are LIT CANDLES sitting on random tables. While underwater.
- While playing as Johnny (Rescuing Alt), Enemy NPC will become invulnerable (middle NPC on bridge over Alt's room).
- In Nocturne OP55N1, When V gets back in to the elevator after talking to Hanako Arasaka, Johnny sits down and does a butt-slide animation over to V before kneeling in to the correct position. I've recreated this every play through.
- Checkpoint items don't update if player moves too fast (ie. If player sprints inside a room before the checkpoint cleanly updates, the checkpoint will remain at the door even though the player is already in the targeted room).
- If a friendly NPC has a weapon in their hand and uses a computer, they will continue to hold it Goldeneye style while typing on the keyboard. This can go for any mission.
- During ""Dream On"", when you need to follow the surveillance van and you get out of range, the range exceeded message will continue to display even if you catch up to the van.
- During ""We gotta live together"" there is a group of NPCs spray painting a van, however, the animation looks like they are supposed to be tagging a wall as it does not move at all with the contours of the vehicle.

Menu/Settings:
- Players privates become exposed randomly -- can recreate by changing pants in rapid fashion.
- Menu items will load and you cannot select anything or move the mouse and then immediately reload to function correctly.

Free roam glitches:
- When running on a rail (ie. sidewalk), speed will double/triple.
- NPCs glitch in to objects
- Objects randomly move or explode
- NPCs/vehicles disappear when focus is taken off of them
- Vehicle assets don't load in correctly (sometimes not at all) and will ghost through other objects
- Player is killed by running in to a vehicle or object just right
- Sometimes when entering a car too quickly the running animation (screen swaying) continues while in the car
- When driving (usually when driving fast), vehicles and pedestrians don't spawn leaving you with an open and empty world
- When ""jacking-in"", sometimes the cable does not display, indicating V is not holding anything at all.
- Vehicle speed is not accurate. For example the speedometer on the bike shows you're going 200+ MPH, however, the scenery around you looks more like 60 MPH.
- Nearly impossible to fall off of a motorcycle.
- Sometimes parts of weapons will float after being picked up
- Sometimes objects will float when coming out of a cutscene (V's necklace floating by the window instead of sitting on the nightstand during ""Path of Glory"").
- Cooking food items are misplaced (bowl of pasta without the bowl) next to the woks.

Combat:
- HUD items will glitch and remain on screen during certain events (ie. Attack options while driving a car or during non-combat scenes. This also goes for random selection items or shades behind words -- the shade will remain on screen until the game is reloaded.
- Can glitch in to combat when game is obviously forcing the player to not enter combat by alternating right/left click quickly.

Enhancements:
- When in a vehicle and close to a destination, the player is forced to exit their vehicle or drive in a very slow fashion (Disable the invisible walls! If I want to drive a car/bike right up to the elevator or door I should be allowed to).
- NPC voice content need to match the current situation or actions the NPC is performing. For example -- During ""New Dawn Fades"" there is a man sitting on the bench just outside of the cemetery with his head in his hands and a woman standing in front of him. When you engage the man he will say things totally unrelated to his sorrow (ie. ""Got a smoke"" while still holding his head in his hands). This goes for every NPC in the game.
- Don't sugarcoat or *wink wink nudge nudge* the nudity. If V is not wearing pants and is nude in the inventory menus, there is no reason why V should be wearing underwear when not in menus."
1609622860,Easily Best RPG shooter made
1609622809,Is it perfect? God no. But it's still good.
1609622784,"Decent looter shooter type of game that doesn't offer anything new besides Night City. Even then the City can feel dead most of the time with nothing else to do in the game besides the shooting. The AI is meme worthy and it's only worth a couple of playthroughs since your choices don't seem to matter much at all.


"
1609622671,"The glitches and scuff will be fixed over time through patches, besides that the story is great!"
1609622650,Hilariously glitchy but still a beautifully fun game with a good story. Totally worth the money spent.
1609622626,"On PC its just fine
"
1609622450,yay
1609622433,All bugs aside this game is amazing i recommend it.
1609622350,If you can stand the bugs the game is worth getting. Sadly not much to do in terms of free roam however the main story is great and there are plenty of side missions.
1609622327,"Overall 7/10. If the bugs are fixed, it is an easy 9/10, but not a 10/10 like the Witcher 3. Why? Well... Allow me to describe a side activity. Goal: Get a guy out of a building. How I did it? I used my enchantments to access the roof, used my tech skills to open a hatch, used my hacking skills to disable all the cameras, used stealth to get to him, and snuck out by using distractions like activating lights or disabling enemy optics (they blind). All of the things I did made full use of my kit, and in each step, someone else could've done something different. I didn't need to sneak, didn't need to hack, parkour, break in, sometimes I can I walk right in, like a spy. The bugs make it a 3/10, but this level of character depth with the amazing writing of the people behind the Witcher series bring it up to 7/10."
1609622323,Story line is good and game isn't too complicated.  The game is allows you to play quests when you wish and campaign at your own pace.
1609622301,"I only play on PC. I have had no major issues with the game. I can't control what others may think, but I suspect that a lot of console manufactures pushed the developer to rush release on there platforms. This would be a win win situation for the consoles as, if they get the game on launch day and there are no problems then revenue rolls in. If the game dose not run as it should then they can discredit it and push out there games for consoles play and complain."
1609622265,great game!
1609622173,PC is the best way to experience this game right now.
1609622134,"Is it the best game? - No
Is it a game that we expected? -  No
But it is still a good game, extremally good game. 

CD ProjectRed has spent thousands of hours to create this world and of course, there will be a lot of bugs. But they are not critical. I finished Cyberpunk 2077 in 66 hours with compleating all the side quests and gigs and I haven't found any technical difficulties.
It is a good game where you can find beautiful graphics even without RayTracing, interesting story with different storylines, enjoyable gameplay with a lot of styles.
I am sure that all the bugs and lags will be fixed. Without them, it is a good game which I recommend to buy.

IwHtH's score:9/10
Graphics:5/5
Gameplay:5/5
Story:5/5
Optimization:3/5"
1609622102,"Buggy af lol wait til they fix this (probably in a year since there are a lot of bugs to fix), good game at it's core but the amount of bugs is too much for me."
1609622089,"Has lots of bugs and missing points that need fixes and I wanted to leave a negative review to update later, but after the finale I just can't click on thumbs down.

Gets dark real quick and ends even darker."
1609621972,"This game is BROKEN.... How Hyped this game was, it feels like another No Mans Sky project. This game has so many glitches that you cannot enjoy playing it. wait till it gets patched up or it goes down in price to about $5, right now its just a knock off GTA that is only a quarter as good. The games story line might be really good, but you would never know on how it plays, the glitches are so blaring in your face that you cannot enjoy the game at all. . Game breaking glitches is just ruin your game play and just make it hard to get into the world. 

The game is supposed to look glitched at times, which would be cool if i could tell what was supposed to be glitched and whats not it would be cool, or when it loads your not inside of one of the NPC's and see eyeballs and hair, also you will hit random invisible walls when in fights that get you killed, your player will randomly start shaking and wont stop, you run into people and some you go through, and some will block you. all the cool things that you think you would be able to use, you cant.... it just feels like they worked on this and got half way done and the marketing team like always bit off more than the devs can chew. Please do not buy this game until A. it becomes a better game with patches and free DLC's or B. accept its a shit game and buy it when it goes on sale for $5 or less."
1609621908,"Way over hyped, but if you play just expecting a solid and fun RPG you will be satisfied"
1609621849,"There are definitely some bugs and glitches but the story, atmosphere and gameplay are great, if you are thinking about buying it I would wait a few months until they iron out the problems so it is a better, more immersive experience."
1609621815,"PRO : Lutul foarte satisfacator grafica foarte buna povestea buna misiuni interesate unice 
CONTA : Merge prost in oras ceva gliciuri si buguri care sper sa se rezolve in timp"
1609621814,I walked by some cops and they shot me to death for it so 10/10 immersion.
1609621776,"Disclaimer: This review was made with patch 1.06 and after playing 67 hours.

+ The game is beautiful, if not the most beautiful game made so far.
+ Most major quests (Main story and side quests) are great.
+ Gameplay is very fun. Driving around Night City is fun. Gunplay feels good. Melee for the most part too

- Lots of bugs. Big and small. Tho no gamebreakers for me. Your mileage may vary. 
- There's a lot of cut content with torsos left in-game. Makes you think what could have been. Would have been better if they were gone completely from the game so you had no idea. 
- Equipment is kinda boring
- AI is abysmal, worst I have seen a while. This is the biggest con I can think of."
1609634218,"[h]Honest review of the game[/h]

[b]You can become best buddies with Keanu Reeves what more could you want?! Shut up and take my money![/b]

[u]~With DLSS enabled at quality the game smoothly ran at 4K/60 FPS with everything at Ultra and RTX on medium. These were results regitered with a RTX 2060Super and a Core i7 9700K~[/u]

Otherwise the game is an excellent experience and is very much worth the price. You fall in love with every choice you make as this creates one of the most enjoyable RPG gameplay I've ever played, it very much challenges the whole perspective of how much effort should be put in a game needs to be to be qualified as a ""good"". Overlooking the bumpy release of Cyberpunk just like it's sibling- ""The Witcher 3"" it is very much shaping up to be the 2021 Game of the Year! The campaign took me roughly 80 hours whilst loosing myself in exploring the beauty of Night City and the quests that it offers which I consider to be one of the highlights of this game that really makes it stand out from all other current competition. Buy it now while it's new or wait a month or two for stability patches that will make this game even better than it already is, either way you still need a mid range PC to even launch it and a high-end PC to enjoy it. It's truly the benchmark of next generation gaming and if this is how next-gen games gonna be like this just got me excited for what's to come."
1609887538,"So far so good! (7.5hrs)

Amazing game, very Deus Ex meets Witcher 3, a few minor glitches noted, text from Johnny Silverhand not disappearing, other minor things you would expect from a new game, but WOW what an excellent game so far!"
1609621593,"It got some glitches and bugs, but hey it's a fun game."
1609621580,Cybercum 2077
1609621580,"broken. Also really regret buying this on Steam. They fail to also see this game is broken af. They, like CDPR, just see the $$. The hours I have in this game are just making videos of all the buggy and hilariously broken things. Save your money."
1609621567,No dick physics but other than that great game
1609621558,"NEEDS TO BE FINISHED.
audio missing, lots of problems with basic game play, for example the ability to grab items, connect to terminals.
getting several calls at once, or when you are already talking to an npc.
sometimes enemies just go on T pose and stop working.
also, there is an extra ""character attribute"" that does nothing in the entire game.
overall the game feels halfassed from the 70% of the main story line.
 i don't recommend the game until it's finished."
1609621557,This was an awesome game. Yeah it had some bugs here and there but the overall experience was amazing. I loved how the game made you fell like you really are in the city and you can just go wild and explore and experience everything.
1609621534,"Fun, if not as full as expected"
1609621568,I`m loving the game.Full of action and diverse gameplay approach.But as much as i enjoy it there is still much to work on and polish.Waiting for future updates.
1609621481,"It is a shame this is not released as an early access game - because it is mostly just that. 

But what an early access game. Cyberpunk falls short in a lot of ways due to lacking polish or entire systems (the wanted system is just as bad as the videos, clearly desperately hacked together), but the big parts of this incredibly detailed game is there. The fantastic world building, the Doom esque (if you spec that way) combat, the incredible atmosphere. It oozes cool. 

The illusion is often broken by bugs and various issues, which is kind of fine if you like me like your open worlds janky. I think CD Projekt Red set out to make a Red Dead 2, and instead they made a Saint's Row 2. A supremely janky, busted, game, which bugs often are more entertainment than annoyance. It's not the slick supreme premium gaming experience like a Rockstar game, it's kind of a beautiful mess. 

I feel for the the developers that spent years on this and obviously had a clear vision to set a new standard in this type of game - and gaming as a whole - only to fall flat with perhaps 1-2 more years (yes, it is that janky) of development needed. Most of all I find it ironic that this entire game goes so hard to explain why capitalism sucks, actually, while itself being purely a victim of capitalist reality, pressuring workers for years on end and causing them to deliver a very buggy and incomplete product. 

I have played for about 40 hours - I can't launch it via Steam/GOG as it hard crashes to desktop every time, hence 0,5 hours played - and I love it. Get it if you really like Deus Ex, if you dig CDPR writing, and if you love camp-clearing for hours and hours like in Far Cry/Assassin's Creed."
1609621459,A lot missing that was promised. May start playing again if the Devs add back in all the cut content.
1609621343,"Pretty good game on PC that's a blast to play. Combat is not buttery smooth but did you really expect that? It's good enough. Hacking is fun, and I at least have had only a few problems with stealth. Driving is meh, it isn't project cars or dirt rally or anything but it can be fun. Driving seems to have the most problems but if you actually drive on the roads and don't ram into people and cars every 2 seconds you should be fine. Runs at a playable 45 fps on average for me, on mid settings at 1440p and I have a high end pc (Ryzen 7 2700x and GTX 1080). I did not notice the fps at much except during cut scenes and after loading into an area or loading from a save for about 10 seconds. Also some very fun side missions with references to memes and other games and tv shows, most of which feels cringy but is kinda cool to see. I can see myself playing well over 100 hours on it, and playing through it again."
1609626077,"Negative for now, only because it simply is unfinished (in the hopes they fix it up).

The game is fun for the first few hours and the first few main missions that seem closer to what we were led to believe it would be like.
But then things like (ignoring the bugs and glitches):
The cops teleporting in and forgetting to chase you.
The three starter choices that only really affect the first quarter hour of the game as far as I can tell.
Censoring the nudity when they made a big thing about genitals.
Standard NPCs that are dumber than old Skyrim ones, walk into each other, forget and wander off, despawning, don’t go anywhere, ignoring gunfire etc.
A single destructible wall in the first mission and that’s it.
AI traffic jams for no reason.

The list kinda goes on for things that either seem really rushed or cut entirely that start to detract from the enjoyability after a while.

So here’s to hoping they’ll fix it up and it’ll be great to play and I can update this with a glowing review later on (once it’s on sale after us idiots paid to play a full game).
C’mon CDPR what are management up to?"
1609621309,nice
1609621243,"- Even on the highest difficulty the game is super easy after the first few levels.
- Unbelievable dumb AI, yet once you are in combat they always know where you are.
- Police teleports right behind you after 1 second, wtf?
- Millions of bugs, some of them game breaking.
- No real way to reset skill points. (beside an ingame item, which only resets perk points.)
"
1609621213,"An absolute blast, a few minor bugs at this point and the AI isnt the greatest but i enjoy the gun play and the side characters are fun and interesting"
1609621208,"This game is an incredible work of art that obviously had a lot of passion and attention to detail on the things that they got done. The feeling of the world is there in spades, and I absolutely adore the story, as well as the characters. The gunplay feels immensely powerful and deadly, given that enemies or yourself can only take a few hits before going down. 

But, yeah. This is not done. They obviously never finished car combat, and almost everything feels like it just didn't get that last once over before release. I'm going to recommend the game because I got my money's worth out of it, but I am ultimately left with a feeling of disappointment. It will take them years to get this to where they wanted it to be, and I'm not sure I'll even care this thing existed by then."
1609621060,"Love the dialogues, story, gameplay, music, immersion and customization.  My only complaint is that I am only able to run this game on the lowest graphics settings due to my 5 + year old rig.  It still looks as good or better than the PS4 and Xbox One versions.  I am now considering getting a new gaming rig with the newer graphics cards."
1609620937,Small glitches here and there definitely not unplayable also one of the best games i ever played so far
1609620878,"I only have a semi-decent mini-ATX PC build and a 3 year old GPU. I experienced a few visual glitches and some screen tearing on day one, but the hotfix they released quickly addressed that. I find the game in it's current state is passable and not as ""unplayable and broken"" as the entire internet would have you believe. With some polish, this game could be a solid experience. The one thing that it has going for it is that it has narrative character, and interesting characters."
1609620854,Even with the bugs it's a very fun game
1609624878,nice
1609620665,is pretty cool
1609620590,I can't recommend the game cause it crashes every time I open to play... I guess I'll watch the gameplay on youtube instead
1609620471,"Yea, lots of glitches, still not a bad game."
1609620464,"Haven't experienced any major hiccups, but I have a beefy rig. Having a lot of fun just poking around the city, and the storyline can be engaging. I'm Interested to see what multiple playthroughs look like because it seems like there is a lot of patchwork storytelling going on behind the seems. I get the sense that decisions branch farther than you initially think."
1609620381,"It's awesome if it runs. Def check it out in a few patches if you're currently, understandably, on the fence"
1609620354,Why Do you Cum
1609620265,"was kk , fallout but new features. meh, would reccomend

1609620211,"Just beat the game! I enjoyed it !! I barely saw any bugs and had a very smooth experience.

1609620194,Fallout New Vegas 2077
1609620176,"Cyberpunk 2077 can be a buggy pain in my arse at times however I am still in love with this game. I cannot wait for CDPR to fix the bugs and release more content.

If game glitches damage your calm, maybe wait 6 months. That said, honestly even as a carebear gamer with zero experience/interest in first person shooters, I cannot get enough of this game."
1609620151,its like skyrim with guns
1609620061,"So yeah, this game has its fair share of bugs none that are game breaking. many are frustrating if they happen back to back. but all in all its a fun game. I get that people are disappointed in how NOT next gen this game feels. it was supposed to be this incredible world where you could lose yourself and live a life as a badass digital cyber human and it didnt deliver. we got a game that was very much last gen and some of the open world stuff is sorely lacking compared to GTA and other staple open world games. like how the crime system just spawns cops right in front of you, they dont chase you very far, and theres no car chases with crazy gun fights like they showed in the trailers. vehicles have a weird physics to them. the crafting system is vague and doesnt teach you that you need the base weapon to upgrade it into the next rarity. lots of QoL issues. BUT if you are able to tolerate those minor inconveniences, the combat, character progression, and story are interesting enough to me. Your relationship with Johnny is fun, you meet cool characters that you can choose to help out, and most importantly for me, V freaking talks. and the voice actor is great in my opinion. i was so tired of the silent fps main character. So yeah, can it be improved? yeah miles and miles of improvement are necessary. Did they mislead everyone with their marketing? yup. If I didnt know a thing about the issues and advertisement on what kind of game it was trying to be, i would enjoy this game with zero complaints. I am still having fun and no i am not forcing myself to sit down and play it because i preordered it and am trying to justify my purchase. i just enjoy playing games with side quests, clearing a map full of objectives and slowly seeing the map become less cluttered. I love skill trees and tinkering with how each skill can affect another set of skills."
1609620011,"Love this game, even with the bugs. I've been waiting for it to come out since they initially announced it. I can't wait to see what this game evolves into over time and bugs are fixed."
1609620002,"9.5/10: If you have the PC to play this, then its the right game for you.

To say this game is bad, would be wrong for me to say.  While I empathize while those who cannot play the game as I have, I have to say that I haven't enjoyed a RPG in very long while. I was completely drawn in and hooked from the moment I started playing. From the character development to the absolute beauty of the game world I was immersed in the world.

Pros: 1. Graphically Stunning on Ultra (even with ray tracing off)
2. Character development is by far the best I have interacted with in game. You're choices in the game hold weight all the way to the end.
3. Playability: There are so many play styles on how you want to go about beating this game. To achieve a significant challenge and diverse gameplay expierance and test out each build I recommend playing on Hard mode.
4: Keanu Reeves AKA Johnny Silverhand is the best Voice acting performance Ive seen in a game.
5: The soundtrack to this game is really good and pairs well to the moments in the game. (I do omit songs from the Radio stations)

CONS:
1: Driving needs major improvement on PC Mouse and Keyboard plain and simple.
2: All the bugs that cause you to die every so often or just get in the way of questing. 
NOTE* Some bugs do prevent story progression if not recongized and mitigated.
3: Inventory system needs hashed out. If I wana clear space and get all the consumable it should take less than a minute, not 5.
4: Grinding for money near the end game becomes a difficult task as you do all the side gigs. Unless you do the duplication glitch ( I didnt)"
1609619927,"truly expected the worst honestly aside from some wonky ai interaction i have had no real issues and really enjoy the game.
"
1609619901,many bugs but many fun
1609619768,This is the first game I have ever played that compelled me to get 100% completion - and I enjoyed every minute.
1609619762,Fun game
1609619761,"В игре нельзя переспать с Панам, играя за девушку..."
1609619742,"Great game, immersive story and copious amounts of character customization options. 

"
1609619730,"Cyberpunk has a lot of faults, and a lot of things that could have (or even should have) been added to truly make this worthy of being called a legitimate master piece.  With that said, it still has an excellent story and some of the most compelling characters I've ever had the privilege of interacting with in a game.  The voice acting is splendid (even Keanu, but ESPECIALLY the feminine V voice), and even the combat is surprisingly enjoyable, even if a little simple and (99% of the time) easy.  

My play through took 90 hours, and while I did a lot of optional side missions (and pretty much all the ""major"" side ones) I certainly could have spent even longer roaming around Night City.  There's a lot of content here, even if the main quest itself is pretty short."

1609619646,buggy but good
1609619552,its alright
1609619475,Love the game
1609619407,"Despite the bugs, cyberpunk is still a rly good game and a ton of fun"
1609619389,I got recommended specs aside from OS and the game still cant keep a steady 60 fps on low. Everything else seems fine but man idk how to fix that lmao.
1609619297,"- bug fest
- runs like shit
- acting is awful
- RPG that constantly gives you only one choice (only when the main character doesn't just steal the spotlight and starts talking for you.
- Terrible NPC AI
- Terrible Police AI
- an unfinished game that looks like if it were finished it would still be mediocre."
1609619239,"If your system plays nice, this game is worth it. The world feels almost endless and while it may not be exactly what was described (hyped), it was definitely worth the price. Awesome cyberpunk atmosphere absolutely filled with depth and immersion. First and only game I have yet to use fast travel within, if that means anything."
1609619202,Awesome game! but still bugs XD

1609618732,"Yeah this beta staged game killed it for me. There are a lot of bugs and missing promised features. Pitiful really. AI is weak. No Physics. Heck GTA V has way better AI and Physics and that game is 7 years old. Story could have been better told. Lots of T posing. There are areas clearly unfinished. Some of the glitches were funny however they just add to the stack of crap this game wasn't supposed to be yet clearly is. 
They should do free DLC+Expansions and fix this crap game along with delivering on the features that were told to us that would be in the game."
1609618668,<3
1609618641,"really enjoyed my playthroughs, cant wait for the dlc and then multiplayer?. rich story arcs for characters that make you love them. strongly support the game"
1609618918,"I would love to recommend this game, but I cannot.
The game has such a great immersive world and the creative work behind it is amazing.
The Story is great and allows side mission with a real mission name are great. The rest is garbage.

I have played a one shot pistol build and it is so overpowered that every mission is just too easy even on higher difficulties. So in my opinion the character progression is pretty boring.
Technical whiz the game is in A disastrous state. I mean The relic error bugged so often and destroyed the immersion of the whole world. Missions, Items, characters, Cars mostly every technical aspect of the game is not finished.

So if you really want to play this game in its current state just focus on the main story and side quest with a real mission name. If not, wait until CD Red fixes most of the technical issues and grab the game next fall sale"
1609618515,The game has a very compelling story with characters I actually found myself getting attached to. If you life the witcher series you will love this game. It has that same feel to the dialogue and storytelling. There are quite a few bugs that still need to be worked out but I feel they will iron them out and continue to improve on this fantastic game
1609618415,Over hyped but not garbage
1609618393,"Positive:
- Deep story
- Interesting gameplay
- Great dialogues
- Awesome side missions that don't waste your time
- Keanu Reeves

Negative:
- Game sometimes feels unfinished
- Some bugs and and glitches but playable
- Graphics eat too much performance for what they look like"
1609618387,"Disclaimer: I'm writing this assuming the many bugs the game launched with either have been or soon will be squashed by the time you read it. If you can't stand technical issues or immersion breaking bugs then check the state of the game before playing.

I've thoroughly enjoyed this game, on my second playthrough already. There are a few areas where it does fall short compared to other open world games or RPGs, but it does manage to be a good hybrid between the two. Is the driving as good as GTA5? No. Is the RPG depth as good as The Witcher? also no. what it does well is create a detailed world with an incredible depth of lore and lots of possibilities for discovery. The graphics and artistic design are second to none IMO. The gameplay is fluid and fun, easy to pick up but with enough depth that mastering your abilities during combat will be a challenge depending on your build.

I can see myself attempting multiple plays with various character builds."
1609618352,"Good story, haven't experienced any glitches. Only 48fps on a 1080ti though. Very demanding graphically."
1609618298,yes
1609618226,"On a high-end rig, I have found this game lush, immersive, vibrant, satisfyingly complex (both in the moral and political world, and in the character and human interactivity), and all of this wrapped in a gloriously detailed world that sings of a grand and complicated epic of human and technological life that is absolutely heartbreaking, whilst also grimly humorous.  Three cheers to the excellent craftsmanship that went into the masterpiece of gaming - and a requisite condemnation of the corporate greed and lies that led to so many hurt people around the making and releasing of this game."
1609618164,tis good
1609618011,penis
1609617965,this game still amazing despite some bugs
1609617898,"Immersive, open world with countless interesting story lines driven home with great voice acting & main character models. Combat is fun & rewarding, with an excellent cover system. I've experienced minor glitches & bugs but that is to be expected with a giant, densely packed, open world game. The ray traced lighting really hit me when I was cruising down the street on a motorcycle toward the setting sun, the reflections of light off of the wet asphalt was stunning. The game is very ambitious and the developers promised a lot, in my experience they delivered on almost all of it. Really awesome game to get lost in."
1609623157,in full honesty i waited a couple weeks before taking the plunge and buying this for myself. i was excited at first but now at the point that im at in the story im just seriously bored and have felt as if theirs barely any action. you'd at least hope with a couple hours early on you would get to fight a lot and essentially learn the mechanics and wants to go for some sort of build. Im almost 9 hours in and Im probably going to take a break as i feel bothered trying to get to the action.
1609617710,"I really tried to spend time with this game and enjoy it. I put almost 80 hours in to it, beat the main story twice with two different endings. But I don't think there was a single hour of gameplay I had that wasnt bug ridden to the point where the game crashed or progress was halted. I finally hit the last straw and requested a refund when the game just crashed so hard that IT LITERALLY UNINSTALLED ITSELF. YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT. 

So I said fuck it. I'll try again in a year when this game has another two dozen bug fixes."
1609617688,fucking blows fat stinky ass i like it a lot though just needs a few hundred tweaks
1609617588,evga 3090 ftw3 ultra go BRRRRRRRRRR
1609617537,"A rich world, and tabula rasa main character for you, the player, to define--neither of these promises were successfully achieved.  In my opinion, the success of the Witcher series was, in some ways, Cyberpunk's undoing. The Witcher series took a defined, detailed character, and cast the player into the dusty leather boots of Geralt of Rivia, a man who kills monsters and hates politics, portals, and undercooked meat. That might seem irrelevant, but it goes to show the amount of lore, thought, and history that existed behind the character before CDProjekt even began development of their video game adaption. All of this existing story and history meant that the player wasn't defining the character, but rather, experiencing the story through the eyes of an established persona. So when Geralt responded in a particular way to a series of events, it was unobtrusive, as it fit within the parameters of the character.

Now let's apply that to Cyberpunk. While there is existing history behind the world of Night City, namely the pen and paper resources, the main character, V, is an unknown character with no established story--an empty vessel for the player to define, build, and navigate through life as a mercenary. But Cyberpunk isn't a story about the main character, nor is it a story about the city itself. It is a story about a controversial, long dead character--a rebel against the corpocracy, and to some, a mass murderer and terrorist. Clearly, the writers of the game decided that they wanted to tell you a story, and if the player character doesn't agree with their story, and therefore chooses to take another route, the main story should punish them for their reasonable descent. Essentially, you either agree with the message about the evils of corporate control, or you will, without a doubt, receive the worst possible ending to the game.

So to sum up, this is a relatively linear game, in which there is a cannon storyline to which the player is expected to adhere. The game makes that relatively clear, as it strips out many RPG elements, causing the main character to respond to situations in ways that do not in any way fit the player's intentions or chosen life path. A pro-corporation V, struggling to get back into the good graces of her former employer? Absolutely not. It doesn't fit with the story the devs wanted to tell, and it certainly isn't rewarded. Is that a problem? Not per say, but it definitely means that Cyberpunk is an action-oriented, linear story driven game, set in an unnecessary and lack-luster open world, and confused by a myriad of shallow, RPG-like elements.

Verdict: If you're looking for a true RPG experience, in which you can define your character's views and help shape the world around them to match those opinions, this is not the game for you. If you are comfortable taking a trip through a visually stunning fantasy city, and relinquishing control of your character's destiny to an ""affinity"" tracker in your inventory screen, there's alot of good things for you to experience in Cyberpunk."
1609617518,Even with all those weird bugs and shitty performance - the game worth it
1609617504,"I love it. It's got everything I expected from a CDPR game. Gorgeous graphics. A world that feels alive. Great music. Side missions that could be campaign missions in any other game. I haven't experienced any performance issues so far. I'm having a blast with this game. I've been waiting for this game since it was first announced and so far, it has not disappointed. It's everything I thought it would be. I understand there are alot of people unhappy with it, but i'm definately not one of those people."
1609617388,"very muhc punk, very much cyber 10/10"
1609617356,has some smaller visual bugs more comedy than anything lmao other than that its a fantastic game and i have yet to run into anything game breaking
1609617306,good story... yes it has its bugs but its a new game with committed developers they will be ironed out and at the end of the day its defo playable and enjoyable. remember any game when it first comes out is guaranteed to have bugs
1609617129,Game is preem
1609616932,"Despite the bugs, the game plays just ""ok"" on PC. I have a 2070 STRIX and i cannot run ray tracing without the frame rate dropping to 25fps. The graphics are ok.... nothing like the trailers or previews. I would guess you will need a 3090 to run this game at max + ray tracing. 

The main story is good, and there are plenty of sidequests. I am enjoying the game.

My main gripe with the whole game is the leveling system, If i am encountering and defeating enemies with level 30 weapons, then I should be able to use those weapons. It gets old using 300-400 rifle rounds to put down a random enemy just because they are ""stronger"" then me. While they, in turn, can one shot me with their pistol. 

The teleporting cops are annoying. If you injure a civilian, police instantly teleport to your position and start shooting at you. its obnoxious and needs to be fixed.  I have heard people talk about save file corruption, I have not encountered this issue."
1609616925,"Had 1 or 2 bugs, an amazing game but really think it could have done with another year of development. NPC just walking in loops f they go to the metro stations. Thought the way you dressed would get more reactions from people. Side missions are pretty repetitive  the main story was  not ass long as i would have liked. All the people on old gen cons need to shut up  of course this game will not  run well on a 7 year old software. Was it as good as i was hoping it would be NO do i think CDPR will fix problems yes, am i looking forward to the DLC yes i am. Overall id give this game a 7/10"
1609616866,I know this game got a ton of shit when it first launched but they are constantly patching the game. I've played it on medium graphic settings and it still looks amazing. Play it for the story not the vis. The journey is worth it.
1609616768,I am the LAW
1609616765,Very In depth game
1609616738,"Cyberpunk 2077 is undoubtedly well crafted, creatively driven and acts as a turning point for Tech-Noir styled RPG's, but is the innovative experience we were all led to believe? 

NO... but its still pretty good"
1609616700,Awesome
1609616640,I am enjoying the story and combat so far 13 hours in.  No major glicthes or bugs encountered so far.
1609616421,"Since I could not refund this with 4 hours of playtime through Steam & CD Project Red's offer to refund everyone was only for consoles I figured I would play more and post about it.

The game is pretty fun to playthrough once. Each life path basically has a few missions and verbal differences but they all play the same story. Each gender has a few ""romance"" options but nothing like advertised.

There is very little in terms of special AI and they all seem to act the same. They teleport into places at specific times, have funny throw-away lines but if you try talking to them it's all generic.

The gameplay is fun for about 3 hours until you realize the AI really follows basic patterns and it's not hard.

It's not nearly a RPG it was initially advertised as until after release. The side quests are fun, and the story is interesting but the game was over-promised and SEVERELY under deliverying.

Even on a 8700k with 32gb of RAM and a 1080Ti on the 1.06 patch my game still has visual issues on High settings with extreme frame drops of over 40FPS lost. After turning some settings off and dropping to medium for some it's more consistent.

There's little nudity and VERY little use of features advertised. This was a Penis 1 move by CD Project Red. I hope it does get better with age only because I couldn't refund it like they said. A $60 lesson..."
1609616386,Amazing game despite thew bugs
1609616328,2077/2077
1609616252,"even with all those bugs, it's really good game"
1609616193,"Despite the bugs and glitches, this game is amazing"
1609616188,Great Story Almost 100 hours played so far
1609616150,"A fantastic game, cannot recommend enough... so long as you have decent hardware to run it."
1609616143,"This game is simply amazing. The story is absolutely marvelous and the gameplay overall good. There are certainly some stains though: A lot of things are still very rough and miss proper polish and there are animation/visual bugs. HOWEVER, no game breaking bugs that I have encountered or crashes or anything. Overall an amazing game that will probably be outstanding after some more patches."
1609616254,"Writing is inconsistent - some characters/quest lines are great (e.g. Judy, even if you can't romance her the quest line and character development is stellar and she doesn't drop off the map when her quests are done), others are lacking with abrupt ends, no resolution, and characters dropping out of narrative inexplicably (e.g. Jackie and his side quests in Chapter 2, Skippy, Takemura, Voodoo Boys, Aldecados, Regina's quest lines, Delemain). Main quest line is incredibly short and the majority of content is in side-quests of varying quality. I found the side-quests for Johnny to escalate their relationship suddenly - developing your relationship with him goes from 3/10 to 7/10 (the maximum possible) in the span of 4 quests, instead of nuanced development throughout the game, with specific choices in one seemingly mundane conversation being pivotal for one ending. The way the game approaches its final act gives you the impression of branching endings, but several 'branches' fold back into one of the three possible endings (excluding one lazy 'ending' choice). 

Technical flaws I'll skip - they're talked about enough. I just didn't find the game world striking in any way and I didn't like the armor system - had to spend most of the game running around looking like a clown to capitalize on strong equipment, and the crafting system was underdeveloped and focused mainly on weapons.

Netrunner/hacking builds were super cool and well-developed, though. It felt like a better-developed Watchdogs vibe. I'd ask for more, but considering the constraints of engine and what's playable/approachable for the genre and audience I think they did a good job.

I was expecting CP2077 to be more like Witcher 3 - with a long, winding story where you get to revisit characters and where your choices mattered in an epic final chapter and you get to see some of your old friends again. Maybe it'll mature and develop in time, but I wouldn't pay the premium to play this game over again. This feels less like the ""next step"" and a regression for CDPR in terms of storytelling.

Ignore time played - due to repeated crashing, I played this game without Steam (reduced crashes for some reason), so total play time was not captured. It took me about 3 days playing on-and-off to complete the main quest, all side quests, and about 1/3rd of the open world/NCPD criminal events. If you're an Nvidia GPU user, you may want to search ""NVCleanInstall"" - using a customized driver package created with that tool vastly reduced my crashing."
1609616119,"ok, this is a beautiful game and its exactly what you would expect from CD PROJECKT RED 
a very nice open world experience and interesting story, credits to all the voice actors too 
putting the glitches aside you would truly enjoy it specially now when they fixed a lot of the issues, this is an rpg game but if you dont like rpg games well there is always cheat engine, so many side missions with direct impact on main story but its in your hands whether you want to play side missions 
currently thinking of playing it all over again to get those sweet different endings 
if i were to give it a score i would say 9.5/10"
1609616102,Similar to Fallout New Vegas
1609615990,"Besides the bugs that game in the beginning, this game was a phenom."
1609615969,"This game is a great cyberpunk beta.  Extremely buggy, sure, but extremely fun to play and a very immersive story paired with interesting game play. Most bugs can be fixed by a simple reload of the instance so save often. Would highly recommend you see for yourself before coming to an opinion on the game. For some it won't be worth it and refunding is an option if you don't enjoy the game and that's okay. Others will see past the flaws there-in with bugs aplenty and enjoy the cyberpunk experience (on PC and next gen consoles ONLY, unfortunately it's unplayable on base model last gen consoles). Honestly a decent video game fusion of dread, blade runner, and GTA/Deus Ex gameplay. If you enjoy cyberpunk and role playing games, you will find plenty to enjoy here. That being said eve cybermancy or ghost runner will give you a cyberpunk experience without any bugs if you're looking to play an engaging game in a cyberpunk world. I hope this game continues to get updates that will fix the glaring issues."
1609615960,This game has gotten a bad wrap coming out the gates of release with bad reviews and complaints about awful glitches and bugs but for me the story line and beautiful graphics added with fun game play and depth make this an actual really fun and decent game worth playing. The price is a little high for the product but overall I give Cyberpunk 2077 Two thumbs up! Plus DUDE! It has Keanu Reeves! How can ya go wrong!?
1609615928,"Do not buy this game. It is a poorly crafted mish mash of game mechanics done well in other titles. EVEN if I set the bugs aside I still cannot justify spending 49.99 on this game. Having played 74 hours I sadly have to live with this insane fucking mistake I made. The amount of cut content and false promises made by CDPR is baffling; stuff like hacking people with your monowire, being able to approach each mission differently. I based my entire build around hacking and stealth (netrunning) but what is the fucking point when I can just whip out my katana and chop up every enemy in one room in 20 seconds? There is no incentive to have these playstyles and it really shows when half of the damn perks are useless stat increases. I can't do any of these things that were promised, because for some reason shit that was shown in gameplay demos is non existent. 

There are so many issues that I haven't even mentioned but those were the bits that brought my experience down massively (considering your playstyle is literally the way you experience the entire game). This game needs a full overhaul, and significant polish for me to ever even touch it again.

However, CDPR probably wont fucking fix this piece of degrading filth, and instead will probably fix bugs, add some dlcs and then call it a day and make Witcher Stranding 2.

1609615871,"This is such a comically broken game. Quest lines are bugged, combat is glitchy and inconsistent, AI is garbage, car handling is trash.

At least another 6 months."
1609615833,"World design, storylines, missions, loot, fashion, weapon systems, hacking, gameplay and replayability are all five star despite the bugs, AI, driving and performance issues.  With fixes, this game has the potential to be one of the most spectacular gaming experiences of all time."

1609615830,"Great Game, but the game has way too many bugs and glitches. The game is also lagging for 4K. I really cannot play this Game at 4K. Too many issues. 1080p is better for gameplay, but I tried. It's really good. The gameplay sucks at 4K. It way too lags a lot. The cutscene is too laggy. Sorry about that. It would be best if you guys fixed it, and also, you guys need to fix 4K gameplay, or otherwise, I can't play on 4K all the time. I like the 1080p. Cutscene seems relatively fast and better, but the graphics are alright to me. I would say if you buy this Game or not if you want. I would rather say. It's a great game, but the gameplay needs to fix many issues and improve the graphics and the cutscenes too! 8.5/10"

Bugs are quite numerous and exceeding my expectations. So far those bugs don't affect the normal process of the game but they do sometimes destroy the immersion of the story. On the other hand, the optimization is not that perfect, so the actual pc specs are required higher than what system requirements say. The User Interface looks amazing, but not that clear and easy to use. It requires more steps to get what players want."

1609614820,"I'm not going to state the glitches and the bugs that the game has as by now everyone should be aware of them by the amount of videos on social media. 
Lets start plain and simple this game is a total scam ! ! 

This game takes me back to the days of No Man Sky.

You start the Game by customizing your character V (He/She) which you might lose a bit of time as its actually fun and ""complex"" to a point you can change your genitals...(size...) for something that...you will only be able to see in front of one specific mirror inside the game.
You will be able to chose your classe at the beginning (Corpo , Nomad or Street Kid) and then dive in to Night City.

Oh boy...Night City...it does look incredible the graphics are stunning you can actually feel the retro vibe going on... but...yes you guess it there is a but...Its lifeless...The people walking around Night City have no purpose no brain you see same models over and over again.

The story of the game well...its ok nothing really impressive...Just a someone trying to get to the top of Night City and the interaction of Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves) its probably the only Hightlight of this entire game. 

Driving..its just horrible I have no other words.
The menu's when you go to a vendors actually feels like I'm back in Zelda games in SNES just pure basic. 

Not all is bad..The shooting side of it its actually Fun!

Unfortunately CDPR has let us down not just us consumers but also investors.
This game promised so much and yet failed to deliver in the worse way possible.
Even if CDPR manages to fix the glitches the bugs...This will still be a bad game.

I don't Recommend at all... wasting your money on this game if you are curious just watch videos on social media as there is plenty out there explaining that the glitches and the bugs are just a mask of the horrible game behind it.
 
Hopefully other Gaming studios will learn with this big flop and understand that sometimes its better not to lie and postpone the release date then giving consumers an unfinished product.

1609614814,10/10 would play again. xD
1609614753,Wait for bug fixes and updates.
1609614680,"fun game. I smile alot. Nice Women
/Mr Raccoon"
1609614650,A Few bugs here and there but im used to that by now 500+ hours on skyrim other than that i love the game i mean only had it since christmas and its the 2nd and i already have 34 hours on it
1609614640,"Welp, guess there is no way to get good ending in this game, no matter how much you try everything is f up in the end and make you sad/"
1609614593,"Cyberpunk is a great modern day open world game. Anyone giving overly negative reviews just built this game up to be something it could never be - it's nothing groundbreaking, but it's a tremendously solid open world game. Don't be expecting witcher 3 side quests, (which is a tad dissapointing, admittedly) as most of the side jobs are pretty simple, but they're what i've spent most of my time doing so far so it's not to say they're not enjoyable. I haven't had any major bugs in my 30 hours of playing, 0 crashes or game breaking issues, just the occasional random floating object. It's super fun imo, and if you like open world games, as long as you haven't built your expectations up to unprecedented heights, you should have a good time."
1609614582,Buggy to be sure but really loving it so far. Story of course and very satisfying combat in several ways. Give it a chance even if you might have to wait a little longer!
1609614541,"First of all I have not completed the game- I have 13.5 hours on file as of providing this review. I did not pre-purchase or buy the game day 1- I believe I purchased the game about a week after initial release date and in that week the devs provided a couple patches to fix up bugs and optimize the game.

TL;DR: I do recommend, but if you haven't purchased it yet, I would wait a month or so to give the devs time to patch.

I recommend- but be warned- this game has been hyped up a little bit and from what it sounds like the devs got pushed into releasing the game a little early so it is a bit buggy. After updating my GPU drivers it seems to have fixed some of the stranger glitches but I still have experienced a couple glitches that forced me to load a previous save and come back in (When using the scanner during combat it will sometimes just stay on, making it so you can't fight back and time is slowed way down). Fortunately the game autosaves fairly regularly so minimal progress is lost- it is still a bit frustrating though.

The developers nailed the Cyberpunk aesthetic/atmosphere and when you're playing the game it's really easy to get caught up in what's happening around you. The sound design is really good and there's a lot of details that makes Night City just pop off your monitor at you. 

This is probably personal taste, but I feel the story is pretty engaging. I often find myself playing through the main quest (which I rarely do on these types of games) to find out what is going to happen next instead of wanting to progress to the next level. They don't spoon feed you things either- a lot of stuff you have to figure out on your own, which can be difficult at first but rewarding when you figure it out.

Character customization is interesting, you can get a lot of varied results, there are a lot of options to change your character's appearance, but the options are presented as ""presets"" (for example, eye color 1, eye color 2, eye color 3, etc.) when it seems like they could have easily been sliders that could have been adjusted instead, so it's not as in depth as the trailers make it seem.

The game is a bit glitchy. Most of the time I get weird ragdoll physics on corpses, once I saw an NPC spawn clipped into a wall- this was just a civillian though and didn't have any real interactions available to it. Biggest bug I have spoken of already.

I can't review this game without addressing the people complaining about the poor experience they're having. I have a decent gaming rig- it is not up to date and I am gaming on 1080p, not 1440 or 4K, partially because I want higher frames but mostly because I can't afford a higher res. monitor at the moment- that is beside the point. People with supposedly much better rigs than mine are reporting poor FPS while playing.

Here are my specs:
CPU: Ryzen 5 2600X (@ 4.1 GHz)
Memory: 32 GB DDR4 3200 MHz
GPU: 1080 TI

I am getting a fairly good frame rate- though I will admit I have not actually checked the exact numbers.

I have a friend who is gaming at 1440p on an i5 6600, 16 GB of memory and a GTX 1060, and the frame rates are a bit lower because of the GPU but they're still not that atrocious.

Another friend of mine is gaming on a GTX 970 and reporting good speeds as well.

If you have an NVIDIA RTX-series card (2000 or 3000 series) or a card that supports ray tracing and want a high frame rate, *turn ray tracing off.*

Overall this is a solid game and I do recommend, but if you haven't purchased it yet, I would wait a month or so to give the devs time to patch out bugs and polish it off and give it a little more TLC if you're looking for a polished experience- but I will say the bugs I've encountered while playing this game are pretty tame. If you feel you can't wait though it still delivers a fairly enjoyable experience. Again, in the 13.5 hours I've played I've only experienced a game stopping glitch twice, which was fixed by reloading a previous save and only set me back about 5 minutes or less."
1609614521,Simply awesome
1609614372,"Best game I ever played in a long time, with the bugs and all that :)"
1609614356,"I know there were a lot of different problem for different people on this game from the release date and still a few bugs to date, but I really do love this game! I have been waiting for this game to come out since they made the very first trailer for it 7 years ago. The game play is fun, the graphics are amazing and the story line just keeps giving and giving. All of the different choices that you can make in the game really make it a new experience every time you start a new game. All of the side quests are really good too. I can't wait for more updates and DLC's to come out for this game. I have heard the first one will be out sometime early this year, so we will have to wait and see!"
1609614158,"Não tive nenhum bug de quebrar o jogo, conforme algumas reviews diziam. O jogo é muito bom e bastante divertido. Não está no nível de Witcher 3, que ainda é muito superior mas o jogo definitivamente vale a pena de ser jogado.
Recomendo"
1609614114,"This is a great game and it would be greater if it wasn't so rushed to come out

+ The story is great, the graphics are jawdropping (if you have the hardware for it), the narrative is AMAZING  due to the motion capture tech. Its an immersive world where you get sucked into. The customization of how you wanna play: stealth like deusex? guns blazing like doom? melee parkour? is brilliant.
- There are several bugs, some of them are very frustrating. The world is gorgeous and incredibly detailed but its only to look at, so no interaction/depth. I kinda missed the depth from a bethesda rpg. The ending(s) feels rushed and a lot of content was cut off. Its a shame the devs didnt have more months of actually putting a finished product, then again, last time they delayed it, they received death threats, so... 

Cyberpunk 2077 doesnt re-invent the wheel but it is truly quite an experience."
1609613860,"Nothing like what we have been promised. After 10 hrs in, skipping dialogue is all I did. Game is buggy and I just can't help comparing it with other open world games coming out years ago, which are all BETTER!"
1609613852,Great game if you have a good rig. Still same random glitches though. Needs more polish.
1609613746,
1609613698,"Bugs are rarely game breaking for me, most of the time i dont see any bugs at all. The atmosphere of Night City in this game is truly amazing. I know these games arent really comparable but GTA feels like roblox compared to this game. The gunplay is *decent* and the driving is pretty good for a dev who has never done it before. The story is also alright not the best ive seen but far better than most. I really reccomend this game to anyone interested in it. you can always refund it if you dont like it."
1609613682,You can jump and bonk enemies with bat.
1609613585,"Avoid the complaints and just enjoy this hell of an RPG from CDPR. It's Witcher 3, but in the future and you get to create your own character instead of just getting Geralt who is already defined in 10 books."
1609613550,preem.
1609613527,great game. i have nothing but fun each time i log in. the graphics are amazing and game play is smooth. yes their are bugs as with any game but they are so minor its not even worth a mention
1609613377,amazing game highly recommend
1609613331,"Me likely, Id likey more if I didn't need to cap the frame rate at 40fps to play comfortably."
1609613316,"Feels like unfinished, unpolished, but it's fun and good overall."
1609613311,"Storyline's kinda short, or maybe its just because I just llike this game so much that I want more. 

Quite sure there is a lot of room for improvements, such as:  More personal customization for vehicles, weapons, avatar.

IMO overall 7.5/10"
1609613262,Fantastic immersive sim set in the most detailed city I’ve seen in a video game to date. Frequent and minor animation and physics glitches but considering the depth and complexity of this game I’m not surprised. Probably could do with another 6 months of patches if you don’t want to live with the bugs for now but I’ve been enjoying it like crazy. Fantastic game!
1609613259,Overall the game is good but it keeps glitching/freezing every time I try hacking during combat.
1609613257,"Love it so far
"
1609612970,"A imaginative world that wishes to be robust, unfortunately isn't very deep. With plenty of copy and pasted side quests throughout the very large map. But where this game not only shines, but greatly excels, is in its absolutely incredible cast of extremely memorable characters, fantastic voice acting, and great story telling. I think the game has some things to improve, but with its amazing story, I can definitely recommend it. I am excited to see the future of the game with DLCs. 
7.3/10"
1609612923,"not at this time, enjoyed at first, however every time they send out a patch it makes the game worse in many ways, graphics are all over the place bad, audio not synched correctly, patched some of the parts of the game that made it not such a pointless grind, and the latest patch cant play at all horrible"
1609612885,"Bland side quests, and average story and a very buggy game make it hard to recommend. Never believe the hype people"
1609612859,good shit boys
1609612824,"Worth the wait. Lives up to the hype. Great game. I see it as one of those ""Not gonna uninstall"" games for years to come."
1609612667,"The game will get better. But after 100 hours of playing. Fun. Just don't expect a balanced game. Still, the city is pretty cool to drive around. The story is rich and the main characters are amazing.  The combat mechanics are cool if unbalanced. 

 The Ambition behind this game was huge, and there is a LOT of stuff to look at and it feels incredible when it works. The artist did a fantastic job. 

 I recommend this if you are not the type to get too burned on early access. This game will be much better in a year I am sure, so maybe wait if you have other games to play

 Otherwise, if you have the time, you will still find loads of fun in here!"
1609612582,"Like a good poo, yeah it was a good poo but ultimately it's poo"
1609612555,"If you're able to run this game, you'll love it and play it nonstop, story's amazing, the maps great, everything is, minus bugs. as of right now the glitches on PC are there (for me at least) like one time I had a strange infinite loop of the game breaking over and over from a character prohibiting like half my actions and respawning into it that took a half hour to fix (really annoying) but its honestly worth the fun, if you have the patience, wait a few updates  (I doubt it'll fix a whole lot but still) because this games amazing. also try to save often, this game may not save after a side job which is also annoying."
1609612392,pppoopoo
1609612185,This game deserves much more love <3
1609638890,"I had most my fun, getting stuck on random things..."
1609612091,"Obviously hype train turned into a hate train. Perhaps the train was going too fast from the beginning, and now after the launch the brakes on it burned away. 
If you hop out of it, and take your time, you will notice this game deserves appreciation on many levels like design, characters, and even gameplay is fun.
Who cares about ped AI and police chase? It's not that kind of game."
1609612046,"One of the best single player RPGs I've played in a while. I've put around 18 hours into it as of writing this, and so far I have not encounter any game breaking bugs or glitches. I will say there are a few that may break immersion for some, but they fix themselves rather quickly and are honestly pretty funny. I compare the glitches to Skyrim or Red Dead Redemption, where it's easier to laugh than hate. I also got the bike from ""Akira"", so it is now impossible for me to talk bad about this game."
1609612027,"Obtained every steam achievement available and I enjoyed every step in this amazing journey. 

Watching John Wick after playing Cyberpunk, feels like I am watching the prequel of Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves). 
Graphics are amazing, even with RTX at Psycho quality the fps was decent. 

Occasionally I would encounter a bug. Like falling through the map while exiting a car. Didn’t encounter a game breaking bug in my 120 hour playthrough. Can I remember the map like I can remember Los Santos (GTA V)? No, each time I drive around I see new things and I feel like there are many more secrets hidden in Nightcity. 

9/10 Love the game, for those with a little older pc, maybe wait a bit for the game be a more smooth running :)
"
1609611983,"Stupid AI
Removed Features 
Bugs

Dishonest Advertising 

Good Story
Amazing Architectural Design"
1609611892,"Is it broken?
It is.
Is it one of the best story driven open world action rpg i've eveer played in 20 years?
It is."
1609611803,"Good story that's the main part that shines, so much to do and the world is great. You need a monster of a pc tho. The gunplay is a little stiff."
1609611557,Keanu is my friend
1609611491,Best Game I have played in years. Very reminicent of old RPGs like Fallout 3 and New Vegas. A+++ game
1609611448,bonk. go to horny jail
1609611435,game is fun
1609611417,"Very very good game. Don't buy until it's optimized.

"
1609611353,Despite all the issues and bugs I enjoyed the game. Hopefully upcoming patches improve performance and add features.
1609611471,"1) PROS :
- What a brilliant story. (universe, characters, original audio is perfect, many endings, post last boss fight, every ending can last up to 30-60 minutes as if you are living a Netflix episode while being the main character its sick ! ).
- What an amazing graphic performance game (lights, visual effects, everything is psycho beautiful except water (sea) the water from rain on the ground is perfect) (RTX 2080 AT LEAST recommended, i played 144fps (1980*1080) ultra settings no FULL HD or 4K) 
- Building/template is pretty neat for most gamestyles.
- Hoping for next DLC's to focus on balance/difficulty and melee but it will be better and better.
- When multiplayer will be on air, it will be a real hype. This game will be remembered no matter what haters say, it's a half success and thats only because of the world we live in recently see 2).

2) PROS / What a sad world we live in :

- SICK investors pressure on CD Projekt to force a release in 2020.
- some workers in CD Projekt  had to work up to 100 hours/ week for an entire year ?!?!?!?!
- Therefore : catastrophic launch, tons of bugs (most are fixed now its safe to play imo).
- Unfinished game, you need DLCs to fully unleash it's potential. 
- And thats more and more common due to investors pressure for many many studios/companys. 
- There is a URGE that video games companys ask more for crowdfunding projects, otherwise we will keep seeing games unfinished, like pre-order trash looking like alphas and getting bad steam reviews etc (baldur's gate 3 for exemple). 
- And now CD Projekt's investors sue CD Projekt because they hid the reality of bugs etc ? when they pressured them whole year long, what a joke and what a real lack of respect for those that actually CREATED something instead of just putting dollars in the void... 

Anyway please recommand this game because it is hard work and a solid new pillar to the genre. Don't be Salty just like it :)"
1609611224,Seems fun. Has potential.
1609611176,"Fukin' preem.

Dispite all the crap that's been thrown at this game, it really is pretty awesome, and I had no perf issues. 160 hours, 5 crashes, four of them before the patch for it, and multiple game sessions lasting over 12+ hours each. Honestly makes it more stable than most other AAA titles."
1609611173,"Insanely fun.  There are quirks and it's not perfect, but I'm having a blast."
1609611097,It gets buggy but overall its a pretty fun experience. Hopefully the game gets ironed out with patches over time.
1609611067,The only positive outcome of playing this game is made me re-playing Fallout 4.
1609725258,"Beautiful intricate game with multiple facets that can keep you going for hours. There's a list of pro's and con's of this game that is essentially going to feed off your personality and tastes. You can play this game 100's of ways, if your a fan of The Witcher 3 or Mad Max you'll dig this its a fun but grindy but doesn't just let you win forces you to adapt and overcome. As flawed and buggy as it is, the game still has boundless potential you might want to give a try to make your own decision."
1609611086,"Beneath the bugs is a very enjoyable game. The world-building is top tier and quest design is solid. Hoping the devs can make the experience smooth on all platforms. It runs well enough on a fairly high-end PC, but I still had to apply the hexedit (google it) to have the game use all of my CPU (AMD), and an occasional CTD still happens. Version 1.06"
1609611009,I tried to give the game a chance but gave up after not being able to pick up a legendary item that an NPC dropped. Not sure this is worth 60$ even if they fix the bugs... maybe wait until is half price.
1609611289,"Every product that has been hyped to certain ridiculous amount inevitably faces great number of people that are let down or disappointed. Truly, a large percent of negative feedback comes from ruined expectations. More so, people are upset with the technical part of the game, constituting of performance issues, bugs and other issues. While the latter can and most likely will be fixed eventually, the first part is a more sensitive problem.

As for me, I purposely did not watch any promotional media and pursue prior knowledge about the game before it came out. I have plenty of personal experience when hype does more harm than good. Rarely, if ever, your sky-high expectations are met. I trusted the good reputation of developer, since I greatly enjoy their older products and was interested in first cinematic trailer. I did not know exactly what I was getting into apart that it had a Cyberpunk setting, RPG elements and supposedly great graphics. Therefore, I was free from the shackles of expectations and enjoyed the product as is.

To start off, I can say that this is among the best AAA title RPGs in since Witcher 3. Triple-A distinction is important, since even mediocre roleplaying game made by indie studio has far more roleplay elements than Cyberpunk. Explanation could be that such 'simplification' is made with an effort to seem more accessible for an average player. A more passionate RPG, such as Disco Elysium easily outshines Cyberpunk in this regard. This does not mean, however, that the game lacks these elements whatsoever. It's just that even the most dumbed-out franchises, such as Call of Duty are starting to implement primitive dialogue systems and semi-non-linear gameplay. That being said, the game still offer certain degree of freedom of gameplay and certain choices in quests.

Moving on, I greatly enjoy the Narrative and overall writing. The main plot is gripping, characters for the most part enjoyable and interactions with them are interesting. While the main quest and side quests are excellent, the 'grindy' parts often lack depth to them and constitute of rather simple enemy raiding - come to a location, hear a briefing and then do an objective either stealthily or with a weapon of your choice. Still, game's mechanics and large amount of tools at your disposal do everything to delay the feeling of repetitiveness, which may happen eventually if you are a completionist.

Simply put, when it comes to action, be it subtle of guns blazing, its very enjoyable. I was at first upset that the game will suffer as a shooter due to headshots not being lethal and enemies having health bars. Thankfully, you can remove the health bars and damage indicators from hud, making it at least *feel* less borderlands style. Though, while you are in stealth with a silenced pistol, it almost always takes only one headshot to finish the enemy - unless its a boss fight. Movement is very responsive and running, double-jumping (with an augmentation) and parkouring around the Night City was just so enjoyable. More than driving vehicles for sure, which have odd driving physics. Motorcycles are somewhat better at that in this game.

As for visuals the game is stunning and truly a next-gen game. No wonder consoles are screeching and full of smoke when they even try to launch it. PC version looks and plays supreme, while still often suffering from visual bugs. Soundtrack I too enjoyed greatly, especially the Main theme and Silverhand theme. Overall its great and fitting to whatever happens on the screen.

Fantastic game, really. It most definitely could use two-three extra months of polishing, but apart from technicalities, I enjoyed it immensely and the time I spent on it flew by incredibly fast. Definitely will replay it in near future. Is it the next  Witcher 3? Not really, as that game was way bigger in scale. Does it give off the same emotions while playing? Oh yeah."
1609610944,"So I went into this game with an open mind, knowing some basics about the general idea and with little hype. 

I started my playthrough and was having fun but noticed a few things that just didn't make sense or just felt like I was doing something wrong. Going in non-lethal? Doesn't matter. Shoot someone in the head? Sometimes just doesn't kill them and they wriggle on the floor with full animations still going.

There are a lot of half baked ideas that straight up feel like there was something more that wasn't acted on. There is a darn skill for holding a human shield and taking less damage but you straight up have no reason to do so. When you stealth someone, you cannot shoot over their shoulder. It's small but this is one thing on a long list of little bits that just detract from this experience.

It was at this point that I started to research a little into the game and what was promised. I quickly found not just cut content that wasn't there but what felt like lies or promises that could not be made truth. 

To anyone who wants to buy the game, I recommend watching this video first - https://youtu.be/_CymqHdNYkg.

Can you have fun with this game? Sure... But that's subjective to what you want out of it. 

I'm about 29 - 30 hours in at this point and was running out of steam to push forward due to some repeating issues and glitches and primarily thought I'd wait for the game to be in a better state before I continue... But unless a No man's sky is done on this game, it's not going to live up to the promises they have made. I'll hold my play for now and hope that they look into the issues to hopefully make a more stable and grounded experience.

I hope this can be fixed or at least acknowledged... This game went in with so much potential and promises that on reflection just wasn't possible.

Buy Witcher 3 instead I guess, hear that's a better title, I'll give that a shot."
1609610882,Awesome game - still fair amount of bugs and glitches that need to be ironed out
1609610877,This is Ghost in the shell meets Fallout: New Vegas ( the best Fallout).  And the combat is flawless.  I don't recommend anything below a 2070 super to play this and stay at 60 fps though.  Even on low graphics with DLSS on.
1609610846,Game is too buggy to enjoy. Wait a year or so until it gets fixed.
1609610794,very good
1609610781,"I enjoyed the story very much, and the combat is pretty decent. driving totally sucks and the ai is trash. the game feels different than what was shown to us. pretty glitchy for me but game never crashed. it was a fun ride but it definitely felt unfinished, and that is pretty sad. maybe it'll get fixed later, but honestly i wouldn't recommend this game at full price. half price might be fair"
1609610559,"Engaging story, beautiful graphics, just what I was hoping it would be. No big issues with bugs. I'm playing on PC, so maybe that's why I am not getting issues.  Looking forward to the DLC to expand gameplay time."
1609610659,"Just finished it. 

Not a bad game, not a good game either. It feels rushed at some parts, specially towards the end. I was entertained, but won't be doing a replay of this, not worth it with the game's state.

I can compare the game to riding a soon-to-be-broken car; the longer I'm driving it, the more it deteriorates and breaks down (bugs, glitches, abruptly cut stories and arcs) and distracts your mind from fully appreciating the road (story and side quests).

Giving a thumbs down, but more to the wasted potential this game could have brought."
1609610374,"Most entertaining glitch simulator of the decade.

Yes, it's glitchy but the story line is entertaining, and got me in the mood to pull out my old copy of Cyberpunk 2.0.2.0."
1609610321,"I'm at just over 100hrs, and I am quite happy so far. The character building was interesting. The skill/tech tree is so massive that I see obviously replay value in perfecting various build types. Also, the graphics have taken a beating from a lot of people, but the graphics where it really matters look great. The combat system is solid and never fails to get me excited. Sometimes when I tire of sneaking/quickhacking, I'll plunge in with melee weapons and finish the fight quickly. The clothing/weapon upgrade and crafting is really neat. Overall, I'm seeing at least a 9/10."
1609610234,"I first saw this game when I was 13, and I finally played it heading into my 20s. I absolutely love the game, I appreciate the heart in the story, and enjoyed just free-running and enjoying the atmosphere of the game, but I cannot, with a clear conscience, recommend this game to anyone in the current state that it's in. 

There's a lot of things that were promised that in the 40+ hours that I've spent playing, have yet to find, and I continue to worry whether the game they promised us all those years ago will ever show up. Despite that, underneath the mess of bugs lies a humanist story with heart, one that can be deeply touching when it wants to, and can also be completely crass and off-putting a minute after. 

Truth be told, I have experienced bugs that have detracted my experience from the actual story and soiled parts of my experience, and for most players that have put in the same amount of time as me, if not more, it goes without saying at this point that there's just no playthrough you can have that'll be smooth. 

Verdict is that you hold off from getting this game—for now. Give the developers the opportunity to make right what their management did wrong and allow them the chance to fix this game and get it back on its feet, and by then, I can assure that you'll see the best that Night City has to offer."
1609610133,"The dynamic sprawl of skyrim, with the looting vibe of the division, and delivering on the promise of what watchdogs should have been.
Some technical issues on older machines, which seems like the executives screwed the game developers here on honestly.
9/10 for concept and fun

if there was a separate category for rating management pushing this to be multi console and come out earlier than ready, 0/10
asshole execs keep ruining good games by pushing release dates, fucking let the developers finish their games, i don't care if the schedule slips, this is not the same industry, you deliver shit entertainment and you ruin your whole brand.  Stop being shortsighted assholes."

I enjoyed this game. It did everything most old triple a titles do best. Cyberpunk excelled in some areas that are best experienced not read in a review. Characters are strong and well thought out. Missions are par for course in a open world fps rpg. Some bugs here are there. All in all this game gets my Seal of Approval."
1609609596,"I really love this game. The characters, gameplay, and story are all pretty good. The bugs really don't bother me. It's no worse than any Bethesda game at launch"
1609609554,"Would not recommend the game in its current state since you will pay full price for an incomplete experience. It's one of the most beautiful videogame worlds i've ever seen, truly giantic and detailed. The story is ok, the characters are interesting but the development is... bland, at most, at least until the part I stopped. I really like the combat, but the skill tree is not really interesting, doesnt add many game changing abilities. Quickhacking is simple, could be more complex, allowing more interesting actions. However, the major problems are, of course, the bugs (that didn't affect me very much) and most techinical decisions that, for me break the experience, like pedestrians and car AIs, NPC spawns and despawns, police behavior and overall lack of random events. The world feels like a shell, beautiful in the outside, but hollow inside. CDPR will probably make the game better with updates, they are known for it. This game will prob become something like no mans sky, getting better and better until it delivers what is promised. But until then... i recommend to wait."
1609609527,"First game in years to make me excited to go home and play! 
Despite all the bugs, still best game in a extremely long time!"
1609609307,"if your looking for the immersive, deeply customizable RPG look else where. Otherwise feels like a bog standard AAA action game. Many of the promised features are not here, and the bugs are frequent enough to kill the games immersive setting. 

"
1609609255,Been playing since version 1.03. Lots of glitches and issues have been resolved since. Wrote this review based on 1.06. I absolutely love the gameplay. The storyline is fantastic. Would recommend this to anyone wanting a futuristic game with GTA-style single player elements.
1609609222,"I do not get the hate and the bad reviews. Yeah there are bugs, but not as many as one may make out. If you save sufficiently it is pretty much wayne. The story and the gameplay is great."
1609609365,"I thought I learned my lesson about buying overhyped games on day one, but I let my stupid coworkers talk me into it this time. It's not a BAD game, but it certainly doesn't live up to the hype. Let's be honest though: nothing could have lived up to the ridiculous hype of this game. 

The combat is fun, and the story is pretty interesting, but I feel like the constant oppressively gritty atmosphere makes the game wear on you over time. 

Get it when the game of the year edition is $30 or less, which it absolutely will be eventually.

One more nitpick: you character is supposed to be a gritty street kid or whatever, but is obviously voiced by a rich white boy, he has that congested way of talking with upward inflection that rich white boys have. It makes the game a little more unbelievable."
1609609167,"It takes a certain amount of chutzpah to name your game after a literary genre. Are you claiming your title is the standard-bearer for the whole genre? Or are your simply selling me a generic store-brand version of something that needs no particular identity of its own? 

Of course, Cyberpunk 2077 isn’t named for the genre directly, it comes by way of the pen-and-paper role-playing game Cyberpunk 2020, not any work of literature or film. As Dungeons & Dragons was to Tolkein-esque fantasy, so is Cyberpunk to the likes of William Gibson and P.K. Dick, less a pretender to the throne than a playground for players and DMs to tell their stories. That world is steeped in tropes poached from all the classic films and novels of the genre canon. From the 80s-tinged fashions, to colorful non lights, to the towering skyscrapers that house its all-powerful corporations, it isn’t meant to evoke any work of cyberpunk fiction in particular but, perhaps, all of them at once. 

Cyberpunk gives you the unique option to choose your character’s back story, playing as either an exiled employee of one of one of the city’s powerful corporations, a free-wheeling nomad from the desert badlands outside of the city, or punk who came up on the streets of Night City’s slums. It’s a fun bit of stage-setting, but after the game’s opening mission, you’ll quickly find yourself funneled into the same role: a merc, a gun-for-hire hustler doing jobs for anyone with the scratch to make it worth your while. Your gender and life path will affect how characters interact with you and open some unique dialog, but it’s mostly set-dressing for pure role-playing’s sake.

When a big heist goes wrong, you find yourself with a head full of precious data, that you can’t extact and that might just kill you -- and the corpos you stole it from hot on your tail. That data, turns out to be a digital mind-imprint of Johnny Silverhand, a legendary rock musician turned anti-corpo terrorist who committed this universe’s version of 9/11 and died some 50 years before the game begins. If that premise sounds a lot like Johnny Mnemonic, it’s probably no coincidence, as Silverhand is capably played by Mnemonic himself, Keanu Reeves, who delivers his lines with a wooden John Wayne swagger. 
But this central plot thread, compelling though it may be, is a small slice of what’s on offer in Night City. After a lengthy first act, the game gets progressively wider, with side-missions pouring into your cell phone from various would-be clients, to say nothing of the countless quests you can discover just walking around the map. This is where Cyberpunk 2077 really finds its groove, many hours into the game. These side stories often start simple, go there, steal that, kill him, but can lead to some genuinely fascinating threads; A hit gone wrong leads you to befriend your target, a convicted killer turned born-again-Christian on an absolutely insane mission to spread the word; a killer clown with a live grenade grafted to his face like a big, red, nose; a porn editor who needs help organizing sex workers to take over their shop. As time goes on, you might notice that some of these stories don’t involve any combat at all. The focus is always on storytelling and role-playing, and this is where the game shines. These little episodes can have characters and storytelling easily on par with the main quest, and it’s easy to lose dozens of hours getting to know them and ignoring the main story. 
While the gameplay concepts in Cyberpunk 2077 aren’t anything new, the blend of Deus Ex-style immersive sim and open-world RPG feels novel. At any given point, you’re always presented with a range of approaches, generally hacking, stealth, combat, or traversal, and the game seems ambivalent to your choices. You can specialize over time to gain some insane abilities, but it’s also perfectly viable to play as a balanced character and switch up on the fly. Often I found myself making these choices solely for the purpose of role-playing. Do I wipe this gang out, or do I sneak past and get what I need? Often it came down to what I thought of them, not what the consequences would be.
And Night City is a world you want to explore. The scale and detail of it are truly unlike anything seen previously in games, a towering, dense metropolis far bigger than Grand Theft Auto 5’s Los Santos, and packed with enough small details to hold up to the kind of scrutiny added by a first-person camera. There’s tons to find down back alleys or under overpasses, every inch of the game feels like it’s been detailed by hand. 

While you can’t explore most of the buildings as you would in Shenmue, there are hundreds of interiors and smaller objectives littering the map. I walked into a diner and ordered a drink, only to have a group of goons walk in to rob the place. I talked them down without ever firing a shot and the ran. Drinks on the house. Down a back alley on a basketball court gangers are beating up a pedestrian. Light them up and the police department wires a bounty. These little moments comprise the game’s equivalent of “random encounters,” and don’t have the same kind of depth as the missions, but nonetheless help the city feel alive. 
Far be it from me to gush over a game’s graphics, but the combination of art and tech make Night City an absolutely jaw-dropping backdrop. I spent more time in the game’s photo mode than I care to admit just marveling at the sights. Particularly for a dynamic, open-world game of this sort, the amount of colored lighting bouncing from every direction, all creating diffuse reflections in the game’s materials would have been unthinkable a few years ago. It’s clear that CD Projekt took criticisms of Witcher 3’s “downgraded” visuals to heart, and have created something that feels purpose-built to push high end graphics hardware to its limit. That decision has backfired spectacularly when it comes to the console ports, but it’s bound to make those with pricey video cards feel justified in their purchase. 

But the city is so detailed it can almost fall into an uncanny valley, where its flaws become that much more apparent. Random pedestrians shuffle around like lifeless robots, sometimes bumping into each other and forgetting their objective and heading off in opposite directions. A car struggles to take a turn and all the cars behind it simply wait patiently instead of driving around him. These details are superficial, and also pretty ordinary; you wouldn’t necessarily expect the NPCs to be smart, except for the fact that everything else feels so real. Small but pervasive bugs, especially animation glitches, can also serve as a reminder that it’s all still just a game. 

But as much as the individual pieces that make up Cyberpunk 2077 are familiar, the resulting whole is unlike anything else. I spent my time in Night City imaging to be V, or at least my idea of V, laboring over the choices big and small, not because they were going to change the world or unlock a more satisfying ending, but because they mattered in the moment to me.  Sometimes this meant a story would play out totally differently, and sometimes – as in the decision to use non-lethal force – it was just a moral decision based on my character. Over the course of about 70 hours – longer than I ever spent in The Witcher 3 – my relationship with Johnny Silverhand had evolved, from mutally antagonistic, to prison cell mates making the best of a bad system, to something approaching friendship. I even let him “drive” the body for a bit to wrap up some unfinished business. After one such quest, Johnny looked at me with some relief and said now it’s time to get back to my needs, and it was only then that I felt “right” about starting the final mission and end my time with Cyberpunk. Not because I had leveled up enough, not because I had checked off every interesting mission, but because it felt like what V would do. If there was any doubt that Cyberpunk is a true role-play"

1609609147,"Great game!
I was waiting for the game since its first annonce. And the game overdue all my expectations!
It is first game since i was a kid which glued me to the screen.
You can definitely say this game made with love and passion by just walking around and exploring the city.
Story line is so interesting, that i cant stop playing. I dont getting bored playing 12 hours in row.
Will defenetely replay the game few more times using another characters and decisions.

1609609146,"Great story and narrative, lots of bugs but not majority of them are game breaking.

1609609051,"As of right now (73 hours played), I'm on my 2nd run of the game. I started playing with very high expectations. The game is getting a lot of criticism over it's bugs and lack of optimization, my take on this is the following: Yes, as of now, the game is very poorly optimized, my 1060 can put out an average of 30 fps on medium-high settings, which is disappointing, the game still looks gorgeous , but I did hope for more. In my opinion, the bugs aren't that big of an issue, they're pretty rare and the internet is making them look way more frequent than they really are. Blaming CDPR for the games bugs and lack of optimization is a dumb thing to do because the whole internet pressured them to release the game even though CDPR said time and time again that it is still not ready. Besides those issues almost every aspect of this game is absolutely amazing, it has a rich and flexible story that your decisions really do effect (and it shows), the acting and characters are amazing and the attention to detail is absolutely mind blowing. Exploring the city is extremely fun and at times I found myself driving with no intention of getting anywhere, just exploring the city. The amount of different side-missions this game offers is unreal and the fact that a lot of those missions effect the main storyline and the ending you get is very interesting to think about and experience. One point that I didn't like was how underwhelming and not special the ending to my first playthrough was, I expected extreme, action-packed events with crazy-hard decisions to take place but I did not get any of them, there was one big decision that ruled the type of ending I got and nothing from there, which was disappointing.
My final score for this game overall is 8/10."
1609609007,An RPG
1609608945,Good story based title. Has bugs. They need to be fixed. Hopefully will get fixed soon.

Police teleport/spawn on top of you commiting a crime, witnessing don't matter.
No rep system, kill thousands of any faction, nothing changes. 

go play any GTA or saints row game and pretend you are a cyborg and you'll have 1000% a better time. Even the silly ones are more immersive and believeable than this shitshow.

1609607796,"Good game, patches helped, needs work but good game."
1609607763,This game is everything i wanted Neuromancer to be in 1988. Good things come to those who wait. 10 out of 10 would wait 32 years for this again.
1609607663,"i liked the game. whatever the witcher was good at, this game was good at. I like the characters, the plot (kinda), the side missions (even the gigs were quite fun). However, whatever they had little experience in, i.e. police, shooting based combat (never tried melee), stealth, crafting, i found kind of lacking. Bugs wise, it ranged from being completely minor to somewhat annoying in my playthrough. Nothing game breaking for me (1.06 version).

Based on my preferences i like the game quite a lot and am happy with having paid full price for it. I am glad i found time to play it. I do hope that the corp learns from this. I feel that the world can be shrunk slightly since its mostly empty space, maybe reduce the number of gigs and focus their resources more on the story, characters where their strength lies and of course improve combat. There is no need for a massively large world in my opinion."

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2319367942"
1609607320,"Firstly, let it be known that the buggy state this game was released in was an utter cock up that can only be blamed on the Corpos that wanted it out before Christmas - Sony and Microsoft. Yes, CD Could have tried to fight back again to get another delay but then you have cheesed off fans and shareholders that'll be likely to drop you.

Is the game good? Yes, it's amazing. The environments are beautiful, the gameplay is great and the story is one of the best written I've came across in a long time... aside from the cruel undertones that constantly play on V throughout - like come on, we all would have liked at least one good end for V and Johnny even if you'd make it insanely hard to get. Problem is the bugs that'll plague a lot of quests. Mostly checkpointing issues, occasional clipping problems and one during Panam's story that if you die and respawn you'll respawn in her position in the car meaning you'll get one of the most simultaneously hilarious and also downright horrifying looks into the internals of her model.

Did this game deserve the flack it got? No. Absolutely not. Given this game appeared to get more flack than Ubisoft's screw up otherwise known as Assassin's Creed Unity and that game came out LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE after 5 or 6 years of development. People also tried to compare Cyberpunk's release to the still disastrous and terrible Fallout 76 from Bethesda - even though that game was terrible right down to it's core idea. This game had a lot of care put in, and if anything, the disaster of its release expedited the bugfixes massively, this game could easily have ended up being a 2021, 2022 or even later release if they decided to keep delaying over and over again to try fix it all in house with a couple hundred testers."
1609607258,"Despite all the bugs and technical problems which will be solved with time, I enjoyed the game A LOT. I've been waiting for a good RPG game for a long time so I had high expectations and this game delivered. Amazing world filled with interesting characters, places and things to do. Never got bored and I will play the game again to do all the sidequests I missed in my first playthrough. 

If you have your doubts then wait a couple of months for all the problems to be fixed and you will have a great time as I did.

1609607148,"I had absolutely no issues with this game. It ran great, looked beautiful and had one of the most amazing story lines of any game I've ever played. Single-Player games aren't dead and this is proof. I just wish consumers would've given the developers more time to optimize the game for other platforms. By rushing them, it's obvious we missed out on a lot of fun little details. 10/10 amazing."
1609607063,Great game but it needs more features and polishing.
1609607002,"It is a good game, though there are some severe issues with bugs which need to be fixed. Though they likely will be patched over time thankfully."
1609606953,The game itself has errors obviously with optimization and there are quite a few glitches you will experience throughout the game. However the story is amazing and there are at least 5 different endings to the game which all take you on a ride! I will be playing out each ending and 100% recommend this game to anyone who has the hardware to run it at a playable frame rate!
1609606807,gaem is bad
1609606772,"Cyberpunk is subjective. To some, a marvel or masterpiece. To others, a bug-ridden mess deserved of all criticism whether from players or observers. It could be an immersive RPG with a rich, dense world with lots to explore. And for others, a decent shooter with a bit too much text and numbers for their liking. To me, it is a game with problems, but certainly has the largest gem imaginable hidden in the rough. Cyberpunk 2077 has been an experience of a lifetime and I am proud to say I pre-ordered it, but that does not excuse the issues that are packed with it.

I have to this point had one broken questline with numerous (catalogued in my screenshots) graphical and world bugs. It can still be enjoyed with an open mind and I would whole-heartedly recommend to someone with the minor caveat to expect issue.

Wastag's Score: 89"

1609606475,The Game has a Few Issues and needs some time to be patched. I would  wait until after the JAN patch before buying. The story is much shorter than I expected it to be do not go in expecting The Witcher 3 amount of content. None the Less it is a very fun game and needs some tweaking. The first DLC is going to be free as well and CD projekts track record for DLC is a good one.

1609606384,"This is a shallow, unfished game. Graphics and Story are great, But there are lots of flaws gameplay wise. you cant do anything inside the city besides side quests and story. feels more like a visual playground with no toys. Wish Project Red would have delayed the game by a year or two so we could get everything they promised. Right now this game feels like 60%-70% complete"
1609606369,Great time sink! 95% of the glitches don't affect the game in a negative manor!
1609606294,"Likes: Story, Weapons, Combat, Upgrades, Leveling up mechanics, Clothing, Graphics.

Dislikes: The driving, the amount of bugs, unoptimized, low FPS even with good card, stupid police mechanics, zoomed in mini map.

This game is like a combination of Fallout 4 and GTA V except with graphics through the roof. It doesn't quite have the fun customization as Fallout 4 but what it does have is the same amount of bugs as Fallout 4 which I find acceptable considering Fallout 4 is many years old. I learned that somewhat buggy games can still be fun after playing Fallout 76 a year after release.

One thing that I strongly dislike about this game is the police mechanics. If you ever want to run into a group of people like one would casually do in GTA 5, DON'T. If you become wanted in this game the police will randomly spawn all around you. The more wanted you become the more police will spawn all around you. And when I say all around you I mean you will see them spawn in RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU and then shoot you. If you run into a group of people it's an instant 5 stars (very similar to GTA) and the police will spawn all around you and instantly blow you up within 2 seconds. That is not a joke it will happen. Another big problem which some will find weird is the car brake mechanics in this game. When you press S when driving you usually expect some sort of slow down or stop. In cyber punk it take anywhere from 1-3 seconds for you to even start slowing down which leads to a lot of crashes and missed turns. Another problem which goes hand in hand with the last one is the zoomed in mini map. When you're going fast in this game you often miss your turn because you simply don't see it in time because of how zoomed in the map is, and that in combination with the brake mechanics 70% of the time results in you missing your turn and having to turn around to go back. Very annoying. 

In the end I recommend this game for the people with RTX graphics card of any type and you might be able to sneak away with a GTX 1080. If you don't have a newer gen GPU then I would say no. You won't get any high FPS but that's okay with this type of game because there is no competition with other people but I would still like to see some optimization from the developers. 

I hope this helps anyone!"
1609606273,"TLDR: There are quite a few bugs but this game was still very enjoyable.

There are bugs and lots of them. The devs are actively getting rid of them.

This game is extremely short if you don't do side missions. That said the majority of this game's story is in side missions. There are plenty of ""fetch quests"" but then there are tons of story driven and powerful missions. Some of these missions seem completely irrelivant at face value; but the moments you experience in some of those side quests have forced me to stop and truely think about them with the same gravity of my choices.
Cyberpunk 2077's core gameplay borrows concepts from things like GTA, AC, the Witcher. You'll get to use a wide arrangement of guns and abilities. You can play a stealthy ninja who murdures everyone with a sword. You can be a tech wizard causing people to light of fire, be shocked to death, or even just make them kill themselves.  Honestly however you want to build your character there is a way to make it work. Craft gets allot of flack but being able to craft a legendary handgun that does 30k damage a hit makes it pretty powerful even without crafting skills. No matter how you want to play there is a way to make it work.

Al in all it a great game and will get better once the bugs are sorted."
1609606263,"Honestly, if your pc can handle it, its a really well made game. I never expected it to be the game changer that the hype led it to believe, so my expectations were tempered a bit."
1609622201,"- The story is great but the endings make it feel entirely pointless.
- The game is poorly optimized and contains boatloads of bugs.
- There are plenty of exploits.
- The city is beautiful, but feels completely dead.
- Driving mechanics feel like V is always having a stroke while driving.

My current opinion is probably my own fault, because I expected a decent game with a satisfying closure."
1609663288,"I'm not going to complain about bugs (which i hope devs will fix soon) or optimization (which is fine, i ran this on a 960 and a 2080s perfectly fine, maybe ya'll doing something wrong with your settings). Im talking about the promises that the game does but never fulfill.

First of all, the city is not even close to be alive. NPCs are brainless zombies who roam around with absolutely no response to V's actions. For example: i ran into a drug dealer, he was sitting on the side of the road talking to the phone while is motorbike was parked right next to him. I stole his bike and he dind't gave a single fuck. I went back, parked the bike and spoke to him which replied ""do i know you?"". Wow, really?
Another time i ran into mobsters kicking a poor tied dude lying on the ground. I killed the mobsters and went to help this poor soul. Sadly, i could not release him from his invisible handcuffs and when i spoke to him he said ""do i know you?"". Nice.
There are an infinite amount of shops around the city, and you can't do anything with them. Do you wanna eat some sushi? Well fuck you, go to a specific vendor and buy it from an HUD and eat it from your fucking bag, does this look like a ""living, deep, detailed city"" where you can enjoy some simple animation? Fuck off!

SEX AND NUDITY! No, you can just see your peepee or boobies in the menu, nothing more. As soon as you leave the menù a magic pair of pants appear and thats it. Dreaming of slaying innocents with a katana while naked? Well, your dream will stay a dream. They probably did this to prevent people from going naked near kids (there are kids but are not interactive, not killable and ugly as fuck. Why? Why would they place them if they ruin the fun?). Speaking of sex, there are few people which you can have sex with. Once. Yeah! Main characters are FFFFble only ONCE. Then you gotta go to whores. And the amazing amount of whores iiiiiiis: 2! A male and a female! Which, once paid, will give you an ugly sex scene which is only the same.

Let's get to the juicy point of this negative revewi. Cyberpunk promised us soooo much and gave us soooo little things. There aren't that many cars you can drive and even less you can buy. Weapons are just few and retextured based on rarity. 0 customiziation whatsoever. Why would you promise a giant world where the player can get into and then you don't even let me change the fucking color of my car? REALLY? I was hoping to customize, swap wheels, add turbos, change engine to my vehicles but no. Nothing. Literally zero customization. And another negative note is the engine sounds, jesus they are so low and ugly. You put into the game a [spoiler] goddamn porsche, you paid rights for it and you spent a lot of time creating lore and models for it [/spoiler] and you give it the most awful fucking sound a car can have. Thanks, i'll keep driving a shitty bike to feel i have a strong engine going.
Cloths are ok, even you can't reskin them. Good stat? Good mods? Looks ugly with your brand new fisherman hat? Well fuck you, gotta stick to that. You can reskin the entire character to some other thing but you can't change the appearance of a single item. I'd like to know if someone has been luckyer than me because i found only 1 reskin cloth but it was shite, never saw another one for the rest of the game.
Weapon customization? 2 slots, 1 for the scope (many of those are buggy) and 1 for the silencer slot. No muzzles, no grips, no custom skins, nothing.
Housing? Nha. Seems like it was cut content but i'm not sure. I felt pretty bummed about this. Made millions? Guess i will keep living around shitty apartments.

Body mods. God i was soooo hyped about them. ""I can't wait to see how my character will look once fully modded"" i used to say. Well guess what? Doesnt matter which mods or body implant you will do, nothing will change aestethically. Only arms will change based on which cyberware you install. Why? There are people with arms, legs, torso, head modded all over the game but the players dont. What the fuck?

This game promise a big living city with a lot of customization and stuff to do. But it's just a Far Cry reskinned with some cool visuals."
1609606039,Gasssssssss
1609605989,"had some weird visual bugs, but the game itself is grate"
1609605954,"Absolute killer of a game - personally I think they have outdone themselves with this. The world is just breathtakingly full of life, there is nothing like this. The graphics obviously make this even nicer, although this does not affect the content and overall gaming experience - of course it certainly doesn't hurt if you can make this look the way it was intended. There are some bugs still at the time of this review, and some of them are more annoying than others, but nothing was a mood killer or show stopper (all my quests worked fine), we are talking glitches and graphic bugs - all of which was surprising, but nothing bad. The only real downside I can say is the short main story, it just screams for more! However, I would totally and 101% recommend this game, although I would do so with the mention of a system which can provide the necessary power."
1609605925,good
1609605799,LIFE IS A GLITCH. STILL AN AMAZING GAME.
1609605756,"i didn't run into many problems, only small ones.
the story is good some main missions change to side missions that still can impact the main missions.
the gun play is decent and there are more than 1 way to play so that allot of fun"
1609607100,"Try to make this short as possible and to the point. First of all, I'm a massive fan of Cd Projekt Red and have been from the first Witcher video game. But to Cyberpunk 2077, with 150 hours point into it, and try to be as honest as possible.
-The life paths are pointless besides the first 20 min or so intro and only have a few dialogue options that do not change anything about the story or add to the missions/quest/side jobs.
-The crafting system is tedious, but I think it is worth it if they can fix the bugs that come with it. Even with patch 1.06, I still have come across problems that the more you craft, the more bugs pop up, and the ones that affect missions.
-Driving in the first person with a car is a nightmare. but not for motorcycles 
-Kinda disappointed with the doomsday clock and wish that there was a different approach where we could become whoever we wanted, good/evil/greedy. Something else besides the set course we are given where we are all kinds of F beside one ending. But I still think the main story was outstanding, with the different variations that come with them.
-Wish there were more upgrades besides the few we have depending on how you create your character.
-I wish there were more character creation options.
-Ai is not too great
-Bugs and unfinished, but I have played worse. I'm looking at you, Skyrim/Oblivian.
-the calls on the phone just because you walked near somewhere, and then they switch your mission to the one you are near just because you stumbled across Is annoying.
Overall, I still love this game and think it is worth it, or until it is finished/updated. Remarkable story that even adds more to cyberpunk 2020, with unique characters and missions that feel different and not the same thing over and over. Here is hoping it gets better as time goes on and fixed hopefully before 2077."
1609605589,It's so disappointing I had to buy AC Valhalla.
1609605542,"I personally love this game. I like the story, and the characters have depth and make you care about them. The graphics are beautiful and I personal had very little bug issues (on PC obviously). When they did happen, they were mostly cosmetic or my car loading in and rampaging through the streets...which is hilarious XP. I totally think it is worth the cost, even if there are some buggy issues. I will say the only thing that I was a little let down by was the ending. I wish it could have been more than what it was. But overall I'm very satisfied with the game!"
1609605536,"For fans of the genre, true worshippers of Blade Runner movies, the Altered Carbon series and the Deus Ex games, this is paradise. I could spend nights just cruising through the game world, enjoying the atmosphere.

For people who expect just a GTA part playing in the future, and those who just want to whine about graphic bugs, thinking such a massive game development will be running smoothly on every system from day one: f*** off and go back to playing Minecraft or My Little Farm on your freakin' cell phone."
1609605516,"this game is one of the single best gaming experiences that ive had in years. truly a work of art, theres so much depth and so much to do. its without a doubt worth a try if you enjoy an open world experience."

1609604956,Despite bugs and odd behavior the story is really good. If you only focus on negative stuff then stop playing games altogether.

1609604837,"I think the game has a great story, style and is a lot better than all the crap reviews I see for it. Sure the game could be less glitchy and should have been released probably another year from now and definitely not for older gen consoles. IMO this game shouldn't even be on a console as its ahead of its time and looks and runs great on a higher end PC. The developers should be proud of all the hard work they put in and I'm sure they will work hard on fixing the issues and adding in a lot of DLC. I'm hoping for official Modding Tools so I can add in stuff as well. :)  -Z"
1609604805,10/10
1609604670,despite minor glitches at launch this game is FANTASTIC
1609604669,"I was expecting this game to be incredible after my experience with the Witcher 3, but honestly the experience is no where near as good. The world looks amazing but other than that there's nothing to it, the npcs are all boring and dont really do much and there are no random events resulting in the city becoming stale in a matter of hours. The AI is absolutely terrible, pedestrians barely react to you and police spawn right on you whenever you commit a crime which is pretty infuriating, games like san andreas and driver which are 15+ years old have better AI than Cyberpunk.

The main quest and side quests are probably the best part about this game, the main story characters are all really good and kept me entertained for a few hours however after this there is nothing to do in the game.

In my opinion this game could have done with another year of development because right now it is absolutely not worth the £50 asking price."
1609604586,"The amount of marketing hype that was put into the game was the biggest downfall. Is it the best modern RPG ever that re-invents? No. However, the overall experience is good when compared to other Action RPG titles such as Fallout 4 or Deus Ex MKD. 

Graphically the game is wonderful (when there aren’t technical glitches). Performance isn’t bad when the correct settings are selected, even when using an older i7-3770 with a newer RX 5700

One major issue with the quest design is that any choice through dialogue only affects the conversational response from other characters and not major changes in the overall environment / plot. This isn’t always the case, though is also the victim of marketing that pushed plot choice. 

Technical issues on PC that I ran into include freezing of sound, animation, and environmental interaction. This is generally resolved with pausing and temporarily minimizing and waiting a few minutes, or having to forcefully close. This tends to just rip you out of the immersion that is present. 

Good game if you go in expecting a decent FPS RPG, though it doesn’t re-invent or introduce any mechanics that are industry changing."
1609604550,"Yes, it does have a lot of bugs, but alot of them are minor and rarely prevent a quest form progressing 

The story is incredible and definitely worth 60$ 

Combat is also amazing, but ive seen people complain about it which i still dont understand

Now for all the cut features, i wish more people gave CDPR time to update the game as i believe it will be worth the wait and even though the fact that they have lied about almost everything theyve shown i still think they should get another chance

But the performance isnt really the game's strong point, im playing on the lowest settings with the following specs:
Radeon RX 570 (8gb vram)
Ryzen 5 2600
and 8gb ram
But even with these specs i still get ~40 fps whereas if the game was optimized properly, id get 60 with medium settings (most likely)

All in all, great game"
1609604536,"The game has occasional bugs, but the developer has been releasing hotfixes to correct these. The story and gameplay is great and I even spend time just driving around and enjoying the city."
1609604497,"Great RPG game with lots of features and possibilties. Story is interesting and compelling. Minor bugs, not very annoying on PC versions."

1609604236,fun
1609603988,"Cyberpunk has an issue not only because of its poor release state but also because it fails to deliver in a lot of aspects of the game. The game is an RPG and whenever it focuses on the RP part, it absolutely delivers. The story is fantastic, the characters are memorable and everything around those characters feels alive. Characters drive the plot instead of the opposite.
However the game underdelivers or at worst fails to deliver on pretty much everything else. It's open world is bloated with same-y missions that cover up some excellent side jobs because of the sheer number of them. It's character, level and loot progression is at best broken. The city is a mess of poorly designed systems and mechanics.
Look, I can talk about this game for hours on end but the point is, this is a good game but it's not the second coming of christ people expected it to be. For me, that's ok. For other people I'd say wait for a heavy sale or skip all-together.

1609603855,"damn this game is full of bugs... but I really enjoy to play it. Recommend to play and pay ^_^
It's a pity, but when it will be fixed, it seems... everyone will forget this game. Also I can't say that I want to go through it, a second time. This game is ""One Time Adventure"""
1609603736,"I like the size and look of this open world RPG. The story line is alright and It's pretty well written. I know people have had issues with this release, but fortunately for me, I haven't. There was one place where it didn't update q quest as expected, but I just used another way through it and everything worked out fine. I would recommend the PC version to a friend with a decent rig, but I have no experience with any of the console versions. All in all, I can see a future for this title, If CDPR works out the kinks for my console brothers and sisters."

1609603517,"Love the futuristic feel to the game. Plays sort of like a first person GTA RPG but with a lot more content. There are some bugs but nothing that make the game ""unplayable"" like Fall Out 76. I wish I had an updated GPU to make the game look even better but playing on Medium and Low still look pretty good and give me the extra frames. I'm 80 hours in and I've barley scrapped the surface of the main missions because of all the side stuff to do which is just as fun."

1609603464,"A blend of Blade Runner, Skyrim and GTA.  Plenty of bugs, but with a 2070 super I get ray-tracing at around 50fps and it is gorgeous and fun. 

Game-play is solid, but the main strength is the narrative and its associated direction, voice acting and motion capture.  Add spices of gorgeous graphics and you have yourself a (so-far / about 20 hours in) very memorable main story-line. 

Probably wiser to wait for a few patches but if you have a solid GPU and like the things I mentioned, I would give it a shot."
1609603435,"It's open world Dues Ex, If you loved that you'll love this and vice versa. You always need to go from point A to point B with some minor decisions along the way, but how you build your character opens up possibilities for which path you'll take. Lot's of options and great perks to build the kinda character you want and feel super powerful.
.
Most of my compliants would be minor stuff, you will encounter some bugs, that's just a given, but the ones I've experienced  they've been minor or could be fixed with a quick reload. 

I also wish some clothes crafting recipes were easier to get, some of the legendary ones can only be found in shops and the rng for the shop selling it seems very low, statwise there won't be much difference between legendary clothes gear some of which you can find just by exploring so the difference between legendary clothes is just a cosmetic thing so I can't really see why the rng on shops selling the recipes is so bad."

1609603234,"Story 9/10. A lot of decision making, what I liked the most.
Found a lot of minor visual bugs, human models collide with each other. On the other hand, none of them are game-breakers."
1609603206,The glitches make it better
1609603457,"First of all, i am not an obsessive person with the bugs. I think it is okay to have some minor bugs in games, especially in massive games like Cyberpunk 2077. 
BUT, the bugs in this game are the worst kind. For example, you are in the middle of a very important conversation with a cyber goddess in matrix, you try to focus on the conversation and try to understand the story but the techno music with only one beat started 10 mins ago in a car chase scene NEVER STOPS until you restart the game and ruins the whole mood of the scene.

Another example, you are in a very important cutscene that your life depends on it. You try to focus on the events but you see weird shaped arms and hands floating like they are inside of a snow globe. And after that scene just forget your arms because you will not see them ever again until you RESTART THE F*CKING GAME.

Another example, you are in a mission where the guns are prohibited in crowds. Game only lets you walk without weapons in that scene naturally(you can't attack). Then you see some of the civilians are afraid of you suddenly, they crawl and beg for their lives for no reason? You say ""oh ok it is just a bug, i must only walk anyways"" then BOOM, you see your path is blocked by a crawling civilian(there is only 1 person passage space in crowd and that civilians crawling body covers the whole passage). Hmm how to solve this? RESTART THE F*CKING GAME.

Oh, you want to play stealthy? Get ready for some high quality frustration. I waited behind of an enemy for the F button to appear more than i waited for the public transportation to arrive in my whole life.

In conclusion, despite my rant over there i really like this game. I just don't want these bugs to ruin this beautiful experience. Until the major bugs are fixed i feel obliged to give this game a downvote. I hope developers fix the game soon and i can recommend this masterpiece with a well deserved thumbs up."
1609918226,"TL;DR: Please Give Me a Realism Mode. Realism Means Players Experience Less Integers

Dear CD Projekt Red
Your implementation of ray-tracing is impressive, and the AI/pathing is good (shame about the way that samurai dodge-run thing gets them stuck in fences). 
Sadly, the arcade-/WoW-style gameplay/mechanics are not to my taste. I think you probably just thought it was safe to give your RPG those D&D elements that so many gamers are so comfortable with. The thing is, it just isn’t suited to the sort of realism that you’re chasing in a game like this. That stylisation of the game mechanics, in the middle of increasing graphical realism, is *wrong*. 
So I will give you another AUD89 for a really good realism mode, basically a whole new game, without a full production cycle. No need to do all the art again, get more actors back in the studio, or pay low wages for more bad writing, but neither am I asking for something as simple as a harder hard mode – I want a more persuasive game design, and maybe a game that requires a little less grind for the reward.
Here is what I want:
Remove item ‘levelling’ (where the same item design comes in different ‘levels’), 
> remove integer-based levelling of damage and armour and health (items and characters) and replace with a check system and a not-too-time-consuming wear-and-tear system
> remove player-progression-tied loot-levelling, and remove general NPC skill-levelling in the open world (boss skill-levelling is at your discretion, I have no preference, as it has no effect on my immersion).
> Remove main-ability-points choices. You will have to remove a lot of existing perks as well, since they are part of the reductively quantitative game mechanics (levelling) system – all those damage multipliers make no more sense than grenade-damage-mitigating t-shirts. Save me some time and decision-making: let post-character-creation changes to base strength and base accuracy be completely trained, rather than chosen as part of levelling up. You can keep perks, everyone loves perks. You just need to lose the large number of perks to do with ‘critical damage’ (which is redefined under realism) and other inexplicable non-qualitative adjustments.  Obviously when I shoot someone in the head with a big gun they need to have a good reason to not die. You can make gunfire less accurate for less skill. See if you can’t make the gunsway look like real gunsway, with a really high-def sight, and also, just make recoil and unsupported firing positions and marching fire do what they do in real life. Then add in armour and cybernetic armour, and even advanced light armours that look like regular old clothes if you want – but you ought to say what they are, and they ought to provide only specific protection. They should probably be expensive. I hate to say that armour or weapons should be destructible, but yeah, that too. It doesn’t have to feel like there is no reason to kick around with anything but a semi-automatic rifle and grenades, but the persuasive realism will come from intuitive (or persuasive) gameplay mechanics which replace the reductively quantitative levelling system of this base game. The game can be easier at the same time. Let me fast-travel from any place to any other place by any available means. I don’t mind if I can get ambushed, but let me choose to fast travel to my apartment or a fence with some hope of saving myself time. Since the game is ‘cyberpunk’, let all the traditional heads-up stuff be replaced by optional cyberware and other hardware (and make it explicit – cash in on this – it’s cool. I hardly notice the medical thing when he wakes up because it’s just window-dressing – let it be really integrated into the game). Give me sweet car crashes so I have some reason to buy good cars. Give me autopilot and let me skip the journey. Now that you’ve teased me with that prickly sky-ambulance, let me earn heaps on interesting side-missions and give the sky some surfaces and let me fly planned routes with my own licenced air vehicle.
I love the idea of this game. People spend a lot of money on hardware. I am not averse to spending more than I ever have on a single game before in order to get you to make this work. I would rather spend as much again on this game and have all this that I'm talking about done well than wait for you to start a new production cycle and make all the mistakes again and pay for a new story and new gameplay with incremental improvements and its own failures in design and execution. Et cetera. Try it. Take another two years and come back to me with Cyberpunk 2077: Realism. 

Update (played 45 more hours!): The 'story elements' suffer from mindlessly received values / nihilism within which environment no meaningful discussion of preoccupation with surfaces, culture, and the shortcomings of pragmatism as a replacement for a whole morality (integrity) is likely to emerge. ESPECIALLY when story is just trimming, you need smart, coherent, well-informed writing - without any sincere values, that well-informed overview is what pulls back the painting and makes something consistent. And if you wanted to do Picasso without balance, then well done, AAA+. Also, it is disrespectful to human autonomy to insert special mods into the game for weapons to pander to absolutist views of the sacred value of the perfect rhythm of the lizard brain. It was amusing for me to read 'pacifier', right next-door, on a weapon mod which increased critical damage. The relevance of the Frankfurt School is more clear than ever."
1609603071,"Only in the first few days of playing did I really experience any bugs that gave me some kind of doubt about it. 99% of which seem to be fixed now. The media is dumb, they shouldn't sue, this is an amazing game that is only going to get better with updates and DLC."
1609602961,"I've got a good computer, so I haven't run into the bugs others have. Occasionally, I see an NPC T posing, but that's more or less the extent of my issues. 

Story-wise, I haven't had an RPG pull me in like this since my early days of Mass Effect. Gameplay-wise, I think this is the smoothest and most polished RPG system I've played. Everything feels useful, balanced characters don't feel like handicapping yourself, and are actually fun, each attribute feels like it has fun builds and adds value. 

The world is huge, vibrant, and feels alive on a scale that other games have trouble matching. Night City feels like a CITY, unlike cities in Assassin's Creed, which you can cross in less than 5 minutes on foot. 

Enemy AI could use some tweaking for sure, but I'm more than happy with the money I spent."
1609602926,is gud
1609602869,Other than a couple bugs this game is pretty fun with some soild graphics.
1609602738,i dont normally write reviews but i felt like cyberpunk earned one. At the start i was a bit put off with how buggy it was and i wasn't sure where i was or what i was doing but after i spent 14 hours in the begining area and i was let out to do my own thing i was blown away. This game even though it isn't perfect and its buggy as all hell it has been one of few games to keep my attention held for over 50+ hours in a long time give the dev time to fix it because they will just like they did with the witcher 3. This game hooks you in makes you feel for the world including all the good things and the bad. It makes you hate people love them and over all it really does feel like your in a diffrent world when you play it. Over all i would give it a 9/10 give it a shot and make sure you have the time to play it because its not a game you can play for an hour and then stop.
1609602737,good game but restart couple of time because bug
1609602683,bad.
1609602557,"After completing the game (all side quests done, all gigs done, all crimes in progress done), I'm not willing to call this game better than a 5/10 at the current time, and it's just a little bit too frustrating to play.

So, firstly, the story. It's decent, but without giving away any spoilers I think half the endings are a bit underwhelming and can only be called ""alright."" The main story can be rushed through in under 20 hours, but you'll lock off endings by not doing important side quests, and if you include only the important side quests you'll end up doing around 30-40 hours. Including the unimportant side quests but not the gigs, you're probably looking at about 50-60 hours of content.

Secondly, the world. Honestly, I wish the crimes in progress and side gigs weren't in the game. They basically make the game needlessly long to complete and there's mostly no reason to complete them unless you have 20 technical ability and are crafting spec hunting. Only a few of the side gigs have rewards I would call meaningful outside of simple xp, but xp gain rates could be balanced for the removal of the side gigs and the crimes in progress and the game's narrative and gameplay would only benefit. That said, Night City is pretty cool, the cars look good, and there are plenty of things to do if you want that experience. Unfortunately, the traffic system sucks, but that bleeds into a later point.

Thirdly, the combat. Honestly, it's bad. It's too level gated and stat influenced, so if you build certain ways you die in 2 shots, but if you build in other ways you are basically invincible and can only die to bugs and certain instant kill mechanics. The gun play is serviceable at most. It's not the best I've ever experienced, but it's not the worst either. It's just okay. Quick hacks are pretty bad in combat, because they typically take too long to use and don't do very much for their cost.

Fourthly, the stealth. This is one of the worst aspects of the game. Stealth is too basic, enemies have 3 general states (unaware, unaware but alarmed, in combat), going from unaware to in combat simply requires that they see you for a sufficient length of time to clock you (which depends on their difficulty, level of awareness, distance from you, and LoS), and there are a very limited number of actions which you can perform. Stealth takedowns are serviceable but clunky, and boring beyond that. Stealth melee/ranged builds are pretty pointless as far as I can tell, maybe with a suppressed sniper or sufficiently powerful pistol you can get something done, but if you were in melee range you could already perform stealth takedowns, which are more reliable. Stealth quick hacking is literally broken, and getting 20 intelligence gives you the ability to clear out entire encounters before even stepping into the arena since you can just ping something and then hack all the enemies through a wall so they can never find you or enter combat.

Fifthly, the quick hacking. It's boring. There is nothing more to say about this. You hold tab, look at something, select a hack, and hit f. There is nothing more to it than that, except you have the option to enter a ""breach protocol"" which you will almost never do due to its utter pointlessness. You also won't be hacking any terminals to control defenses because you hack cameras and turrets individually. There is nothing interesting to it, there are no challenges to it, if you run out of RAM you just wait until it has recharged, and once you start getting to the higher amounts of intelligence you won't really have to wait much at all.

Sixth, the driving. It is okay. It's floaty, drifts are incredibly difficult to pull off, driving with keyboard and mouse is terrible, and the traffic system basically doesn't exist. I've found it relatively difficult to get vehicles to make slight changes in direction without spinning out of control at higher speeds, and forget about drifting into your turns. The NPC vehicles don't actually follow any traffic laws, the lights are always green when you get to them, NPCs don't follow them anyway, and they'll often just stop in the middle of the road for no reason. Basically, it's like driving in actual LA, except the lights in LA are always red when you get to them instead of green.

Honestly, there's a lot more that's wrong with this game (the perks suck and some of them are literally pointless, the massive amount of bugs, the dialogue and relationship system, the existence of the corpo backstory (since it's so out of place and the game was clearly written with nomad or street kid in mind), and other smaller points), but we'd be here all day, so I suppose this will have to do.

Unfortunately, I don't think I can in good conscience recommend this game in its current state. Even when all the bugs are fixed, the core gameplay loop is a problem in and of itself and it needs serious work. If I were to remove the bugs from the equation entirely, I still wouldn't give the game higher than a 6/10, and I wouldn't recommend it except on sale for about 75% off or more.

"
1609602445,"I bought this game with no expectations because I knew over-hyped games tend to disappoint. After playing through the game I can say its a great game and totally worth playing. The story is intriguing and I enjoyed it a lot! There are a few dialogues I encountered that didn't make sense if you didn't do a sidemission in a specific order but these are minor and rare.
Sure the game is a glitch fest but I imagine this was mostly due to pressure because of the hype and delays that came during the production. With that said the game is playable and I didn't encounter any game breaking glitches that would prevent me from finishing the game.
All in all if you are buying the game because of the story its completely worth it and I hope the bugs get patched eventually."
1609602461,awesome game!!!!! please make a multiplayer option too!!!!
1609602401,"Cyberpunk 2077 is - gta 4 level of open world- fallout lvl of bugs - ui level of ps2 game and story of fifa football mananger 2020

Can't recommend AAA game price for a alpha game. Unfinished and Cut to bare bones and you can tell. 

Nothing is next-gen about this game unless you have a 3070 to actually run the game to 60 fps. 

It is not all bad but not worth the price point. 

They will be trying to fix the core mechanics of this game for years and I will still be leery of CDPR in the future.

The more you play the more you realize stuff is missing. 

TLDR: Game is in alpha after 8 years with no signs of life. Cannot recommend at this time for this price."
1609602284,"The skeleton of a great game, but still too buggy for me to be able to recommend it, sadly."
1609602255,buggy or not im havin fun i play with a big hammer and smash its very fun
1609602078,great and beautiful game. UI is buggy though needs fixing.
1609602022,"For PC: Fuckin Masterpiece! Fun for at least 80hrs. Replayability not rly given, but that is not so important. Do yourself a favor and play it on hard! Normal is too boring and too easy."
1609601962,Buggy and unplayable
1609601762,one of the best ive ever played. really fun and engrossing. all of my bug issues have been superficial.
1609601748,Pretty fun the glitches didnt really show up for me and when they did it was pretty hilarious. I think people gave this game a hard time because they were just sad and mad because of all the events that happened in 2020.
1609601733,"So.. Yes this game has bugs, but lets be honest, this was released roughly the same time as Call of Duty: Cold War and that was also riddled with bugs and they have been bangin' their drum for about 10 or so years now, people are quick to jump on CDPR because they promised an ambitious game. In my opinion they delivered, what also impresses me is that they built their own engine for this game from the ground up, they didnt go to EPIC to or anyone else just borrow theirs, they believed in their idea so much so that they actually decided to put in that much effort.

Don't get me wrong their engine is rough at the moment but I want to think of this game as a *very good* stepping stone to something they can definitely refine. I paid full price for this and I honestly think it was worth it, the atmosphere was great, I truly felt like I was in the game, even the territories were so good I felt that I had gone from something out of Mass Effect and then walked into Fallout territory, I mean that is impressive to have such a stark change in a game but yet make it all feel so natural.

Characters were slightly hit and miss, some of them you got really attached to and others you couldn't give a flying **** about, that said they all progressed the story in a very emotive manner even if you did dislike them as a character.

All in all, I enjoyed it, if you like games like Mass Effect then you really should play this. You would do yourself a disservice not to, it is however your choice how much you are willing to pay, £50 was well worth it in my opinion."
1609601733,"Despite the game being overhyped, being released too early, and the game-breaking bugs and performance issues, I still enjoy this game. 

The story invests me into my character (penis slider joke here) and the game gives me plenty of things to do in between main story quests. There are not many random events that I have experienced, if at all, but by actively seeking out side quests, I have no reason to need them. At the time of this review, the game is a buggy mess though. Trees going wobbly, dialog not playing, quests not updating after completion, and screen effects not disappearing. Performance on my PC is not the best, but I get medium settings at around 80-90 frames a second (granted I have a R9-3900X and a 2060, a little overkill).

End of the day, if someone asks me if they should buy the game now, I would say no. Wait for a few performance patches and maybe a free DLC or two to come out, that way many of the big bugs that are currently in the game are fixed."
1609601584,yeah its a pretty good game....needs more penis customization tho
1609601582,"gut gem, mny buggers"
1609680431, Don't punch microwaves :) 
1609601362,"Aside from the small glitches and other bugs, this game is great."
1609601356,Overall excellent title.  It has some issues to work out but they are overshadowed by the depth of gameplay and story.  Looking forward to the DLC
1609601292,its fun despite the bugs
1609601251,"I'll try to replay it again in 6 months to a year. Bugs are still really bad after multiple patches. The AI is some of the worst I've ever seen. The game looks beautiful, but the second you try to interact with the world in any meaningful way, the illusion comes crashing down . CDPR  straight up lied about a bunch of features in this game."
1609601123,"The game was rushed by the community and death threats, so yeah it is a bit buggy. But on PC it plays well enough to appreciate the masterpiece it is. I love this game"
1609601108,"Great characters and story, fun stealth and combat, decent open world to explore. Pick this up if you are fond of RPGs and love movies such as Blade Runner and Akira."
1609600818,the bugs are what makes it fun. After plugging 87 hours into it. 100% its worth the money. I wasnt a fan of the witcher but loved this. Gta style gameplay in a cool setting with some amazing character writing well worth the £50
1609600568,"Even though its recommended hardware will only get you 50fps at 1080p using low-medium settings it's a great fucking game, and in my opinion the bugs add to the experience. Hopefully in a few months when its not buggy and actually optimized it can be called an incredible game."
1609600564,Great Story. Great Graphics. One of the best Games I've ever played!
1609600562,Don't let the salty Journalists ruin this game for you its amazing but read the Spec recommendations before you pick it up
1609600497,Dont play it its boring af its really buggy and just sucks in general
1609600495,期待2077年终极版
1609600461,"Yes, it has several bugs, but nothing that makes it unplayable. There are so many engaging missions and side missions that I'll be playing it for a very long time. Very entertaining."
1609600357,"Tried turn a blind eye on these bugs.
But these bugs really sucked the fun out of it.

Starting to get really annoyed with it."
1609600356,"Despite all the mentions of bugs and glitches, the game is really good when it comes down to storyline, sound (the music), and in general things to do. The game lacks some features but hopefully, more things will come later on. With all that said, I can still recommend the game."
1609600340,i dont know why people dislike this game it dosen't glich as much as skyrim and depinding on what ending you get you will be crying
1609600243,"In this state game could have the best plot, gameplay, AI and living city in the history of gaming, but it's so broken, that it completely drives away the pleasure from me. I'm literally forcing myself through - Skyrim before patches was working better than this, and I'm far from exaggerating. I really really really wanted to like Cyberpunk and I admit that story is good, gunplay is fun (a little bit on a looter-shooter side such as Destiny or Borderlands), but after constant issues with bugged animations, mechanics, flying thorugh textures, missing/silent dialogues, I've found myself more often praying so I could finally play peacefully, than playing."
1609600125,"fuck CDPR, but yeah, I had fun and would definitely recommend it

great NPCs, soundtrack, atmosphere"
1609600124,"Game is gorgeous and fun as hell. Even the side quests are really interesting and fun.
But it's also buggy as hell, and it feels like tons of content got cut.
So If you can wait to get this on a ""GoTY edition"" in a couple of years with all the DLCs and issues fixed, do that. 
I'd say it's going to be a masterpiece once they finish finishing it."
1609600157,"Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines is another video game, based on a pen and paper game, with a wonderful, rich world.  It is widely regarded as one of the best games of all time among those that have played it, up there with the likes of KOTOR. 

 I've felt anxiety about whether Bloodlines 2 will be good, after following its development.  If it isn't, I'll survive, because I got everything I wanted from a Bloodlines sequel from this game.

Yes.  There are bugs, and there's a few things I'd change, but it's an amazing game that I've already sunk hundreds of hours into, and I'm planning to sink hundreds more.

CD Project Red, hear me.  I don't wan't free DLC.  I will happily pay for the DLC, to help you out of your bullshit legal troubles, and to facilitate even more, in a cycle I hope never ends."
1609600009,Nay-Sayers be damned... This game is the best Single player game of the decade.

This is one of the best story games I have played. It plays a lot like Outer Worlds + the Fallout Franchise. People complain about everything being to short but that's because they rush through the story. I'm a bit over 40 hours in so far and I am still mid-way into the campaign. I've been focusing on building my character to a stealthy build and doing all the side paths. All of this and I'm only in the corpo story. There's two others still to do. I will say though that if your computer is not high end you'll end up struggling performance wise. The game is the most beautiful game I have ever seen.
I only have two cons for the game. The first con being how resource hungry and not optimized a lot of it is. It has gotten a lot better since launch and I'm assuming their gonna continue optimizing. The second con being how buggy the game is. So many glitches and game crashing. Most of these are harmless and most of the time funny except one major glitch I encounter. Sometimes randomly exiting a vehicle or hopping a window or something similar my screen flickers insanely with what seems to be my hair/head constantly coming in and out of view and the only fix I have so far is the save and reload the save"
1609599878,Black dog in my head. Guiding me to the end
1609599764,"The best full price early access game I've played all 2020.
Give it another year or two: when they've fixed up the bugs and finished the content, and when your PC specs are a few years beefier, then this gem is really going to shine."
1609599639,"Despite the glitches, It's a massive game with tons of material. Very much adult related. The map was developed with a lot of incredible detail. Just wish it was multiplayer."
1609599614,"lets forget the buggy start and the weird npc AI 
Other than that, the game is pretty amazing. Not really a big main campaign, in fact the side quests are more engrossing.
After the latest patch 1.06, the game is very much stable and a lot of stuff has improved overall. 
The inventory management is cluttered but you'd get used to it eventually.
KUSANAGI is a SICC bike. period.
And overall, I loved my play through and would love to visit night city again.

Has a lot of ground for a sequel. Play this if you're breath taking. 
8.5/10 :D"
1609599449,"Cyberpunk 2077 is a work of awe-inspiring ambition, dazzling with its massive scale and creative vision. The world of Night City is a metropolis of futuristic art, stealing your eye with stunning neon-lit architecture and streets filled with citizens made of flesh and metal. Night City is an open world that immediately pulls you in and keeps you engaged with its dark narrative, meaningful player choice, and overwhelming amount of side content.

Your lens into this tech-obsessed society is the protagonist simply named V, a cyberpunk who you fully design, including their voice, backstory (which subtly alters the narrative), and even their genitals. I spent far too much time creating my look, even though I rarely saw it during play due to the mostly first-person perspective. V is fun to control thanks to immense amounts of cybertech.

V, has an interesting story to tell. It goes places I didn’t expect and gets wild toward the end. The narrative hits its stride when V meets Johnny Silverhand, a former terrorist who is now a digital construct that lives in V’s mind. Silverhand’s thoughts and dark ambitions are twisted and dangerous, leading to great conversational choices and decisions that allow players to shape the story and action. The biggest allure of Silverhand is how he’s brought to life by actor Keanu Reeves, who looks and sounds as awesome in the role as he does in any film on the silver screen. Given how wonderful some of the other characters are (with their own long and fantastic arcs), Reeves doesn’t steal the show – but Silverhand is a constant throughout most of the game and helps save V from being too overbearing.

Silverhand will bring a smile to your face, but Cyberpunk 2077 doesn’t have many joyous bones in its body, and is often heavy in the delivery of its dark content. Night City may be vibrant, but it's home mostly to evil people doing terrible things.

Almost every mission-giver or notable character is vividly brought to life in voice, animation, and by the crazy amounts of detail on their body. The same can be said for many of the locations they inhabit; an outstanding level of detail in the world makes each unique area a sight to behold. I can’t stress this enough; exploring Night City is a huge hook that CD Projekt Red knocks out of the park.

Some of the more memorable characters and story arcs are tucked off to the side, and you may never see them if you don’t veer off of the critical path. I don’t know how many dozens (or hundreds) of hours of side content are around it, but the mission log just keeps growing as you play. While the main story sequences often end with cliffhangers that demand resolution and the thought that you should continue on that path, the best way to experience Cyberpunk 2077 is to see what the city has to offer. Walk into a crowded market, explore a mysterious question mark on your map, and take on the side missions that the denizens are offering – just surrender yourself to moment-to-moment discovery.

CD Projekt Red wants you to soak in the beauty of the world, but also demands you spend plenty of time in menus assigning new abilities, crafting, and sorting through heaps of loot. That isn’t a knock against the game. It’s all handled quite well. Any room you enter could have numerous items to pick up, as well as world-building text you can read. The amount of leveling you can do is immense, which is reflected on sprawling ability charts that take considerable amounts of time to fill out. If you only focus on the critical path, you barely scratch the surface of the abilities, which carry significant advantages to combat, stealth, hacking, and dialogue. It’s amazing how much you can improve and expand upon V’s standard attributes. I also love how doing various things helps improve V in those fields.

Using cyberware and abilities to mess with enemies is good fun, such as cooking a grenade in an enemy's pocket. Hacking cameras and activating devices from afar to distract foes makes stealth satisfying. I enjoyed creeping through environments, hacking the cameras and turrets as I went. I leaned more on stealth than expected. The weapons you obtain feel awesome (and give good reason to track down the legendary and iconic versions), but the enemy A.I. isn’t great, leading to headshots being delivered like they are going out of style. Some enemies think they are hidden behind thin railings, others charge foolishly toward you and then stop without any cover around them. Harder missions (which are nicely indicated on the log) are a little more intense given the spike in difficulty, but the adversaries are still easy to manipulate, unless they are an aggressive boss or cyber ninja that crowds you quickly.

Johnny Silverhand sadly isn’t the only glitch in Cyberpunk 2077. Not since The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim have I played a game that is riddled with so many graphical bugs at launch. The danger of entering a seedy bar loses its bite when one of its patrons stands motionless in a T-pose. Little visual hitches in the environment and characters occur frequently, and they’re jarring, but I rarely ran into anything that affected gameplay. The only major issues I experienced were I could no longer look down the sight of my guns during one mission – reloading my save fixed the issue. I also had a digitized visual effect remain after a cutscene. Again, I had to reload and replay a sequence to get the proper outcome. Regardless, the frequency of the odd visual moments hurts immersion, and can outright ruin a suspenseful moment.

Cyberpunk 2077 is dark and disturbing at times, but the majority of its content is fascinating, and loaded with depth through the various RPG systems and lore. I thoroughly enjoyed my time in Night City, and Johnny Silverhand is a great partner to see the sights with. Cyberpunk 2077 doesn’t overstay its welcome with its critical-path story, and invites players to jack in and stay for hundreds of hours of unique content should they want to.

[h1]8.5/10[/h1]

PROS:
➕ Interesting, well written characters throughout the entire game
➕ Amazing voice acting
➕ ""Side"" quests, which often don't fall short to the main quest but are just optional
➕ Incredible amount of variation to build your perfect playstyle

CONS:
➖ Some technical issues/bugs, but nothing gamebreaking
➖ AI is sometimes stupid
➖ Transmog needed"
1609599448,"even with all the bugs and glitches, it is a fun game to play, 8 years to develop? well i never heard of the game till about 6 months ago, so i guess i did not have any weird over the top expectations that some who are giving negative reviews . 
it is a simplistic, yet complicated game at same time,  IKR, weird. 
it has a fallout/ borderlands feel to it, if you liked those games you will feel at home with cp2077."
1609599355,GOOD GAME
1609599325,"Holy Crap! This game transports you to another time. It is addicting. With a fusion of Deus EX, Syndicate, an Watch Dogs. Cyberpunk is so densely packed with items, NPCs, and missions. I can not stop playing. Only experienced minor bugs so far and runs totally fine on my 1070."
1609599281,"Still buggy, but generally a fun game."
1609599161,"Great Story. While there are many immersion breaking bugs, I have not found anything game breaking after 35 hours. Quality animations. Good depth of gameplay loop. A bit gear dependant. Good atmosphere. Major issue of locking you out of save when you are interacting with story elements, which has caused me to have to either let my cpu and gpu run while paused or tell my wife I will be done in 5 minutes ten times in a row. Pretty strong stealth gameplay. Glitchy but serviceable pacifist mode.
Over all, a good game that is only held bacj from greatness by bugs and glitches. If you like bethesda environmental story telling, bioware rpg and witcher combat (i know it is not great), then you will love this game."
1609599042,"This is an awesome early access game with a great story! Wait what? It's not Early Access? Yikes
Either way it's still a fun game despite the lack of interesting features and bad glitches/bugs. The upsides are that atleast CD is coming out with hotfixes regularly. So what I say about the game is prone to change for the better or worse depending on the devs.

Pros:
+Fun/Good story with tons of decisions in between
+Endless side missions
+Hilarious easter eggs
+Well-made characters

Cons:
-No Subway (However there is fast travel)
-No Vehicle Customization (Makes no sense that you can customize your body, but not a vehicle)
-Bad Glitches/Bugs (i.e. Foliage can be seen through objects in map, getting stuck or slowed down randomly, characters not holding objects right, cars getting launched or stuck in ground for no reason, and many more)
-Wonky AI (Snipers track you through walls, cars will randomly stop in the middle of intersections or ram into your car, cars don't seem to stop for pedestrians sometimes, enemies will bomb rush you over taking cover, and other problems)
-Weapon customization is trash (Some weapons don't allow attachments, some allow one, and some allow two. There's not enough attachments for weapons and not even a option to customize a weapon skin)
-Combat could be better (but it's not the worst I've seen)
-Trash shopping system (You will sell a gun for 300, and would have to buy it back for 3000. As for clothes, you don't even get to try on the clothes before you buy them to see if you like them)

Even with all the cons out weighing the pros, it's still a fun game regardless and recommend it people if they want to play it... however I suggest you have a half-decent computer to run it. If you can barely run Battlefield 3 on yours, then you won't be able to run this on there... at least not well.
As a conclusion, I think this game will definitely get better over time as CD rolls out with updates and will probably be up there and compete with GTA. Right now it seems like it's only competing with Saints Row."
1609598935,good game
1609598701,BEST GAME EVER
1609598690,Amazing 72 Hours on steam over 100 on PS5
1609598586,"This game is great.
I had a ton of fun playing, great story, beautiful art design, amazing world... but also at the moment it has a ton of bugs.

If you really do not care about seen some weird shit going on, you can buy the game now and have fun with it, but I would recommend wait for a few patches to do that."
1609598578,Great game <3
1609598496,Very good games this plays with me when this is dark
1609598187,good game
1609598181,I love this game.
1609598180,"Buggy, broken quests, soft locks, visual bugs, shit performance even above recommended specs on minimum settings, shallow open world, better played as a linear story game. 

Combat system and scaling is just awful. Given broken weapons that trivialize EVERY ENCOUNTER for the rest of the game early, many of the armor modifications are broken, weapon damage numbers and DPS are totally inaccurate, stats are inaccurate. Really don't know what plan they had for this game or where all their money went, but it didn't go into designing fun gameplay or combat, thats for sure. The story is pretty engaging and a lot of the characters are really cool, even if you don't get to really decide how the story plays out much at all."
1609598167,"If you are a person who enjoys good stories, gun play, detailed environments, and true RPGs then you are going to love this game. I would say the game is worth buying on full price but if it is on a discounted price then it is a must buy even if it's a 20-30% cut.

83 hrs to finish my first run, it is one hell of a game. I enjoyed it a lot. I have seen people complain about bugs and a lot of complains on the quality of the game. But I have personally not experienced any game breaking bugs, there were a few visual bugs which might break immersion but it is no where near the stuff I have been hearing about the game. I might just be lucky that I did not experience bugs so until I do and have a bad experience with the game; I am going to stick to 'I have no idea what people are complaining about.' 

The game might not be a game might set a extremely high benchmark for RPG games but it definitely is one of the best games I have every played and raised the benchmark significantly for RPG games.
The amount of detail in this game is just insane and also the game is truly amazing in the RPG genre. If people are coming to this game expecting it to be like GTA then you will be disappointed and its a good thing as GTA is not a RPG."
1609598142,"If you're here for a Witcher 3 type experience, you wont find it.  Think bad GTA mixed with mass effect andromeda story.  buy it when it's worth $20."
1609597934,"Unless you're rocking a completely new setup, you're most likely in for a unoptimized experience. I was barely able to push 45FPS on a mid-high range PC."
1609597775,"[b]Don't let my hours fool you, I needed to get this to 100% before writing this review so I can say that i have done and seen everything.[/b] 

I really wanted to love this game. 
It's probably the only game that I've gotten genuinely excited for in years and i avoided pretty much all the promotional stuff just so I could go in blind and experience the game without any prior bias or expectations. 

The city looks absolutely stunning, at the start of the game I would often just drive around and enjoy the scenery, completely immersed in the city's neon lights and feeling excited about all the things I would do until I realized it's an empty facade, beautiful but hollow.   

Many people have put this better than me but here's a list of things i was disappointed with in no particular order. 

[list]
    [*] [b]BUGS[/b]
All games have bugs, but this is the biggest release ever from a major studio with over 300 million USD put into the game and the state in which the game released is unacceptable. You cannot defend this, it's not close to being a finished product and game companies should not be getting away with this. Everyone has a different tolerance level for this but when the game continues to crash randomly it really takes me out of the immersion. Same with scripted parts that are supposed to be serious and emotional. It's impossible to take something seriously when you see characters T-posing in the background. Several times during scripted scenes when i was a passenger in a car the driver would run over pedestrians and not react at all, which was hilarious but obviously breaks the immersion.   
Many times during missions the enemy would just spot me through walls and since i tried going for a stealthy hacker build it really ruined a lot of missions for me. Other times i would be in shootouts and the enemy wouldn't react to me at all. Just crouch behind an object while i walked around picking them off.  

    [*] [b]CHOICES DON'T MATTER[/b]
I chose to play as a street kid and had a friend that chose to go the corpo route. During the opening sequences we would talk about how vastly different our paths were and how cool it was that we got completely different games. However, we quickly realized that we were doing the exact same things after a while. Apart from dialogue options that don't change anything the lifestyle choices affects nothing of the story. 
At the start i was really immersed in choosing my response, quickly trying to think what i should say but that all falls apart when you realize that no matter what you choose the game will play out the same way. Literally only 1 choice at the end matters which decides which ending you get. 
There are gangs that control different parts of the city and at first i didn't want to kill certain gangmembers because i wanted to be on their good side, but you can kill countless gangsters and nothing changes. The factions don't act differently towards you at all.
Deciding what build to make your character might seem important at first, since i went stealth/hacker i figured that would affect the gameplay but barely does. You will have a mission where need to enter a building and the main door will have a Intelligence check to open which might be too high for you, however literally next to it there will be a window that uses a Technical Ability check to open and at the back there will be a door with a Body check. I liked this initially but I quickly realized that speccing stealth/hacker is pointless as the game goes on. Since there's always a way around things, the fastest and easiest way to go through missions is just to go in killing everyone since you'll get to a point were you one-shot everyone. 
I understand that i could still choose to go stealthy, but so many times the game glitches out and enemies see me through walls halfway through a mission that it just looses any charm of trying to role play. 
Being highly skilled in a specific build doesn't really affect the rest of the story, there are dialogue options but once again they don't change anything.    

    [*] [b]EMPTY WORLD[/b]
There is nothing to do in the world apart from the main quest, side quests and the NCPD scanner events which are basically the exact same thing over and over. And sure, there are quite a few quests to do, but the world just feels empty outside of the scripted parts. If you stop doing quests there is nothing else to do. No minigames, no small side activities to keep you occupied. The fact that so many people have pointed out how much more immersive the world of GTA: San Andreas is and how much more there is to do in that game that isn't related to the main story or just another side quest speaks for itself. A side note i just thought of is that V is the only person in Night City that actually uses a motorcycle. Not a massive issue but it adds to the feeling of cut and paste characters.   

    [*] [b]LACK OF CUSTOMIZATION[/b]
This really bugged me. One of the few things i had read about this game beforehand was how you could customize your genitals. While i thought it was kinda funny and pointless at the time, it gave me hope that there would be so much to do in this game if they had the time to add such an insignificant mechanic to the game. You can customize your junk, but at least in my playthrough it never affected anything, maybe one dialogue option but i honestly can't remember. The character customization is pointless since the only time you see your character is when you activate a mirror, but once you're done creating your character that's it. There is no further customization to be had. Minor changes if you install cyberware but in a game that's supposed to focus on the cyberpunk genre it's crazy how lackluster this is, there's nowhere you can go and change your appearance. 
You also can't customize you apartment, your cars, upgrading weapons doesn't change their look and there's no way to change your clothes but keep the same stat, meaning you will look like a blind person dressed you picking items at random during most of the game if you want gear with good stats rather than looking good.      

    [*][b]NO NPC AI[/b]
This has been covered by many people, but the NPC AI is basically non-existent which just adds to the world feeling empty. Blow up a grenade on the freeway and all NPCs will exit their cars and crouch next to them in fear in unison. Kill someone inside a building and exit to see NPCs running away in fear or cowering where they stand. All NPCs seem to have a set route that they use, and anything effecting that will just cause them to stop. Also the wanted system is completely useless. Not only do cops just magically spawn behind you whenever you kill a civilian but they can't use their cars, meaning that you just got to drive a few blocks away and your wanted level is gone. You can go back to the same cops immediately afterwards and they won't recognize you.      
[/list]

There is more to say but this covers my major issues with the game. 

I am well aware that the board of CDPR pressured them into releasing this game in time for Christmas and a lot of people are pointing to that as to why the game isn't ready, but at the end of the day that is just another excuse. This game has been in development for 8+ years, postponing another couple of months wouldn't change that much. Hopefully some bugs and glitches could be worked out but unfortunately the core of what the game is doesn't hold up. 
If you enjoyed the game and liked it that's absolutely fine and you're not wrong for doing so, this is just my personal opinion and experience. 

I'd like to end this with a quote from Jackie Chan.

[i]""Whenever you do, do the best you can. Because the film lives forever. 'No, because, you know, that day it was raining, and the actor didn't have time.' I said, would you go to every theater and tell the audience? No! The audience in the theater see good movie, bad movie. That's all!""[/i]  - Jackie Chan

1609597705,very much enjoyed playing this game
1609597631,"there is a radio station just for black metal. 10/10

jk, this game is filled with flaws and broken mechanics
-horrible gun play
-artificial difficulty
-inability to hack through walls is just dumb, and hacking in general doesnt work (because of prop/mesh collisions)
-AI feels lifeless
-movement is so unnatural, because there is no movement inertia (like seriously... even Halo and Doom games have this and they are old af)
-bugs... LOTS OF BUGS

but i still recommend this game, just because i absolutely love cyberpunk (subgenre) and the artists really did their work well"
1609597514,"Story good, side EXCELLENT, combat with guns ok, combat with akatana EXCELLENT, driving bad..."
1609597365,While there are bugs the game is awesome.
1609597358,Great game have sunk over 60 hours into it doing the side quests and discover new things when I play.
1609634755,"If you enjoy the RPG genre, or science fiction in general, I'd be real surprised if you were disappointed by Cyberpunk 2077.  The game offers a captivating story and a wide array of interesting characters as long as you don't stare too intently at its shortcomings: it's hampered by a breathtaking number of bugs and an absolutely lackluster combat system.  Despite the flaws, it's quite apparent to me that this game's development was a massive undertaking, a labor of love, and that it deserved more time to be polished up to a fine shine.

If you aren't the type of player to put aside your initial reaction to all the frustrating hiccups that are part and parcel for a game of this scope and magnitude, kick back and wait for a while longer while CDPR continues to patch out the kinks. If you're in search of an innovative combat system with tight controls and uniquely challenging gameplay mechanics, look elsewhere."
1609597244,awesome
1609932379,Biggest disapointment of the year fuck this game doesnt even run on next gen hardware so much content was cut from the game and the thing still runs like dogs*hit. everyone has their own hypothesis as whats wrong with my pc but no one factors in that this game was screwed on launch and still is.
1609597081,"Simply put, the gameplay is only average but the characters, story and world design are superb."
1609597052,"It is solid game, but nothing revolutionary.
If you liked Witcher and never played Cyberpunk 2020, then you may like it.
They put together Witcher mechanics and Cyberpunk world. There is nothing from original CP2020 mechanics. 
So for me it is not Cyberpunk but Witcher 2077. And that is Very Disappointing.

"
1609597003,"the game was working fine the first 2 days, after that all the glitches and bugs people talked about started showing up on me, i lost my save games more times than i can count, the game sometimes refuses to load textures and loads more... today i decided to give the game another shot since my refund was refused, and i cant get past the new character creation, for some reason when you go to select skin color or whatever, your arrow just keeps going up to the first option.. so save your money for now because steam refuses to give you a refund and buy the game when is actually worth it."
1609596951,"Yes there was a long wait for this game and the hype was huge and the bad press about the bugs and quality BUT
cyberpunk is a great game though the hype was a bit of a reach. Gameplay is solid and can be extremely fun just running around doing side missions. Plenty of loot and weaponry to play with, a depth of world that if you take the time will find wonders. My only downfall is the length of the story mode missions, it went a little fast as I spent most time running around side quests. Overall I would say the game is well worth playing."
1609596920,"amazing on pc but sadly on consoles its very glitchy, i played it on a xbox one s and it was such low quality and very laggy. if  you can i highly suggest getting it here."
1609596837,"Unfortunately not what anyone have anticipated...
+'s:
Story is interesting, lore is there, there's voice acting for even the smallest side-mini-quests, graphics are REALLY good (and I've played on mid-high, not on ultra RT ;>).

?'s:
Game is kinda easy - so it's fun to just play around...but yea, it may be unsatisfactory for try-hards.

-'s:
Lotta bugs - in quests, in movement, in AI, in achievements...I'm on 1.06 and trust me, You'd prefer waiting. AI is dumb. NPCs on the street are really poorly made - weird reactions to you and weird responses. Whole progression/skills system is not balanced and not as rewarding. Cyberware does more than skills/perks right now. Driving - it's a chore...basically you speed up as fast as you can and take every corner on hand break - much easier on motorcycles.

Right now it's a really beautifull game that is ok to play - is what I would say if there wasnt any hype for this game...but the marketing has been built up to VERY high level and the delivered goods are not as good as promised...kinda ""no-mans sky syndrome"" but with very nice graphics and story ;D"
1609596837,"The side quests are the real heart and soul of this game,
make sure to do all of them to not miss out on what CP2077 really has to offer

also wait abit for all the bugs to be fixed, they are pretty bad and got worse the further I progressed but most got fixed with a reload of a prior save point"

1609596649,chaos!!
1609596626,"Cyberpunk 2077 really puts me on the fence when i have to decide if I would, or not, recommend it to other players, on one hand the game is buggy, poorly optimized and the combat is stale, on the other it is a game with one of the best stories i have ever seen, even making me shed a tear or two in certain scenes. In my humble opinion, the great story out-weights the game's problems. That being said, it still is recommendable that you wait at least a couple of weeks to buy it, CD Projekt Red is working every day fixing their mistakes, and, once they are all fixed, this game will be a work of art."
1609596625,Penis 2 10/10
1609596616,"Before we start, i would like to make some things clear:  I will be only judging the game itself here, not CDPR, I also only played the PC version and so I cant speak for this game on its other ports. Be aware that english is not my main language, so keep that in mind while reading this.
Let me start this of by answering three important questions : Is this a revolitonal game which changed the gaming industry ? No, not by a long shot. Is it an underdeveloped piece of trash that is outclassed by GTA ? No, absolutelly not. This brings us to the final question : What is Cyberpunk 2077 ? 
Cyberpunk 2077 was meant to be a large open RPG where you decide how you go about doing things, whether building lasting relationships, making enemies, choosing how to aproach and resolve conflicts, whether by bullets, hammers, blades or by words. After completing the main story, all the mayor side quests and dozens of gigs, i can safely say that the game has acheved most of the thigs it set out to do. 
The first thing i would like to get out of the way are the bugs. in my experince i did see afair number of them, however most of them included small thing, such as textures taking longer to load properly and character mouths not moving. The is alos and ungodly amount of pop-in. There were 2 gigs i could not finish beacse the refused to progress, which was the only time the bugs really annoyed me, but thats about it. these thing may differ among other players. 
The story and characters are very well written. I have not met a single character who felt out of place or had bad dialoge. The story is deep, emotional and intriguing. It constantly keeps you interested in the world thats around you and how you are affecting it. That said, i does have its shortcomings. Some character archs are handeled rather poorly and it seems as if there are parts of the story which are missing, as if they were cut out and never really patched up. 
As it is in most games, gameplay is the most important part of the game, and you can clearly see that alot of thouth and work was put into it. There is a wide variety of weapons, atributes, bonuses, perks and cybeware to choose from, to allow you to play as you wish, although some are better that others. i found myself constatly compering gear and choosing which perk will suit me best. The combat is fast and engaging, with enemies packing some serious gear at times, but the game is mostly balanced. While the combat itself is a lot of fun there is a big issue in here, my biggest with the game i have, and that is the AI. To say that the AI in this game is dumb is an understatement of the years. This game probably has the dumbest enemy/civilian Ai I have ever seen. Enemies sometimes stay in the middle of the fight without attacking in any sort of way. Sometimes, they will get stuck in the ground or in their cover and wont do a thing, or they will start shooting the opposite direction of you. I once went into a fist fight and the enemy didnt throw a single punch. 
The last part of the game to talk about is the graphics and soundtrack. The city and its outskirts are beutifull and filled with details. each part of Night city looks and feels different, with different people and gangs living in them. Each shop, bar or a street sigh tells you exactly what kind of place it is and who is in charge of it. The sondtrack of this game is fenomenal. Each song on the radio, or music that starts with combat feels right. Sometimes i would stop for a sec and just listen to certain song or backround music to a moment.
In my eyes, Cyberpunk 2077 is a flawed masterpiece. I do believe that with time and work. It will one day reach the hights it was meant to. Thas why i give it 8/10.

1609596502,This is an unfinished mess.
1609596502,"Bugs and glitches aside i LOVE this game,  The story has me captivated and engaged wishing for more!"
1609596459,"I waited a good while to do this review. I have played for a good few hours and I really gave it a chance with the bugs. I will start from the beginning prolog the story and missions are great characters great, but this was all made for marketing and E3. Once the game finally opens up in act 1 it is very hollow side quests are boring and much of the same. Same with the other 2 acts. I wanted to love this game but it's bad at sleath bad shooting it's bad at RPG it's just an empty hollow game. The city is a dead wasteland no need to explore visually stunning but that's all. The main story is so short it's unbelievable short for what they said."
1609596384,"PC version is good. I never read all the pre-release hype, so I'm quite enjoying the DeusEx/GTA hybrid, though have to say as negatives: the character development is a bit woolly, and also, the game is relatively easy... way too many ways to take people out."
1609596217,"Despite the frustrations with launch, Cyberpunk 2077 fails only to disappoint. An immersive world, an engaging story, and an open world that, while it does feel shallow, has limitless potential. 

Once this game's technical issues are fixed, it will be a masterpiece.

1609596092,"Though the game was delayed and it has its bugs, I have enjoyed the story and the game-play. I would expect to get some fixes in future to complete the busted quests and, of course, some nasty DLCs to shoot some more goons!"

1609595852,Very enjoying gameplay.. i would like to recommend to anyone feeling wanna be i year 2077 haha btw this game awesome
1609595767,"Regardless of some gameplay & graphical glitches, it is indeed a great game, a meticulously created and beautiful world."
1609595691,ye you should wait till like they work on some of the major problems. Story is a shitshow too tho so dont expect too much.
1609595659,"story on par with an equivalent rockstar game, software engineering not. Bugs persist but they are usually not game breaking. With optimized settings, game runs very smooth and looks very good with lots of detail. Driving feels good, a little too easy to slide. Side quests are just as good as the main quests."
1609595615,Honestly worth the wait! I dont see why people are complaining so much... Its honestly fucking amazing. It comes with a few bugs but with such a big and amazing game what do you expect. 100% worth it!
1609595583,Go in without expectation and you'll get lost in the future.
1609595567,"Underneath all the known issues there's a good game to be found here. Compared to Witcher 3 it *does* feel a bit short. The game relies heavily on side quests (some of which should be correctly labelled as ""Companion quests"" imo), because the main quest alone feels a bit short. 

I would wait for DLC before buying the game."
1609595533,"[b]It's a different game, I sense the developers' attention into making this a unique game, but unfortunately it fails to intrigue me into playing it again if I ever will finish it's story.[/b] Story is great and mechanics are quite acceptable. It just feels like something came out of rush and pressure.[b] Maybe we've put too much faith into believing it as an extraordinary game.[/b] Anyhow, if you let me compare it with my favorite game ""Grand Theft Auto V"" (Ignoring the fact that Rockstar is turning it into a money printer...), ""Cyberpunk 2077"" lack a certain ambiance. It just doesn't feel right, maybe because of the complicated systems, maybe because of the crappy driving mechanisms......this list goes on and on. 
At last, I'm still giving this game a recommendation due to respect to the developers of CD Projekt, their courage in making this game, and of course, my love to Keanu Reeves."
1609595460,"The game is good, minor visual glitches, anything that is bad just reload the game. 

Is it ground No not really but you can thank the hype train for it.

Did it need more time in the oven, yes but thank business men for that not the devs

Is the story good YES, its bloody CD red, side missions AWESOME, random events fun and entertaining INCLUDING the not so important sides.

Over all solid 8/10 its awesome."
1609595409,"Never has a game been both so wonderful and so broken. Whether you can cope with this depends on:

a) Your rig. if your PC is weaksauce, don't even bother.
b) can you tolerate really weird ass bugs.

If you can, you're good to go. If not, wait like a year. I'm going to be replaying this in that time with a different character because I loved it so much."
1609595365,"Massive city, addictive gameplay"
1609595343,Awesome! Don't listen to the haters!
1609595267,"Most likely not what you're expecting. All bugs and glitches aside the game is really enjoyable! Story is fun and the side quests offer a lot of content but the world as a whole feels empty, you get thrown in a map with seemingly endless side quests which lures you into thinking the world is full of activities which isn't the case. No barber, no cosmetic surgeons... you cant even repaint your nails. Lack of customization for your car/apartment/V/guns/etc feels like cut content. 

TLDR 
- Solid 7/10 With room to improve
PROS
-Good story + Side quest
-Beautiful looking world
CONS
-Glitches, Bugs
-Cut content

1609595189,"Forget what you hear from""journalists"" this game isn't the be all end all of rpgs but it gets a lot of things right. Pc version works great compared to non current gen consoles"
1609595172,"If you step back from the expectations, it's a good game. If you like the recent Elder Scrolls or Fallout games, then it's like those but much, much better."
1609595054,"I'm really hoping that I will be able to come back and turn this to a positive review, but right now, it's a thumbs down. It was a close call, there is a lot to love in this game, but the number of glitches and niggles and strange gameplay choices mean that I cannot say to someone right now 'oh, please do go and spend 60 euros' in good faith if they are still undecided. I won't go into the bugs and glitches in this review as they are already heavily reported and they will be the first things CDPR will work on, but they have helped bring this down to a negative review. Instead, I want to focus on the points that I feel negatively impact the game beyond simple bugs.

For me, the one big thing I cannot get past is that this does not match up to other huge open world RPG games because it just feels wrong. Within minutes of being given free run of Night City, little issues start to turn up everywhere. One of the thoughts I keep on coming back to when playing is 'Man, GTA has spoiled me' The driving aspects of this game bug me way more than I thought it was possible. Some of my top gripes around driving and travel:

* Handling, acceleration and braking on cars and bikes is awful. More often than not, you will either be limiting your speed or having a frustrating number of crashes. And you can't pull wheelies on a bike!
* The mini-map! When driving, the amount of map shown is still a tight zoom, the same as in on-foot mode. It is infuriatingly easy to miss a turn because it pops onto the map at the last second unless you are once again limiting your speed (which is not what this game should be about!)
* The pathfinding AI is way too jumpy. Even in a car at speed and even with just such a small amount of the mini-map shown, it will still often recalculate, switching lanes and sometimes even indicating entirely new routes at the last second.
* Entering and exiting vehicles is a pain in the proverbial. You have to be very close and often in quite specific areas of the vehicle to indicate your intention to enter.

UI

In general, the UI could just use tweaking. So far, nothing feels very intuitive nor streamlined, you often end up going through one or two menu pages to get to where you want, when there could be sub-pages or no need to even come out of the game entirely to access some things. As already mentioned, the mini-map is a big issue for me and maybe it would be an improvement to have some kind of subtle AR overlay in the game world (that can be turned off and on) to help you navigate, especially when on foot and in an area with multiple levels and a simplistic map view doesn't give you an accurate idea of the route to your location.

A huge gripe from me, which has a massive effect on gameplay, is how crowded the map is right from the start. Every POI is slapped on there, including crimes and encounters that could trigger dynamically when you're in the area, but sit on your map, waiting for you to go and start them (how did anyone think that having assaults just sat days waiting for you to go deal with them would not be immersion breaking). I completed the graffiti tarot collecting mission in under half an hour, because every single location is right there. The map is crowded and far too helpful (which sucks a lot of the marrow from the bones of the game)

The inventory is also just clunky, with it being separated into three completely different sections which could be unified into one. The sorting often makes no sense (group the alcohol together! I will just sell it, so stop making me have to hunt for it) and whilst I appreciate the level of detail, having your consumable page filled with fifty types of soft drink that all do the same thing but take up different slots is frustrating: here, I would advocate the use of a sub-menu.

Gameplay

The game is good and the writing is excellent, but all of these little issues around it lessen the experience. As mentioned, the glut of map points, many of them indicating events that shouldn't just be waiting for you to go start them, really take away from the 'living, breathing city' feel a game like this should have. At the start of the game, you are absolutely bombarded with new side- and mini-quests, overwhelming you and filling up your journal, cluttering your map and would be much better if spread out a little more through the course of the game.

Likewise, entering a new area has the same basic effect: some faction leader for that area will suddenly be aware of your presence on their turf and within moments give you a call to offer you jobs and vehicles. When I speed ran the graffiti tarot mission, I went across the map and within the space of ten minutes had racked up seven new quests from various factions just because I was motoring through their area. Completely unrealistic.

In short, the game hands you far too much. CDPR were maybe worried that Night City would feel too big... but that's the point! The main quest should be the highlight of the game itself and side missions and mini-quests and optional encounters should be found, giving you a sense of discovery, not just thrown at you in such quantity and with so little grace that they lose all meaning.

I can see a great game in here. None of what I have mentioned above is game-breaking and likely all of it could be fixed. But right now, immersion in this game is really low because of many of these issues. I find it almost impossible to feel invested in this game world in a way I've done previously. I really hope that once they've finished squishing bugs, they'll maybe start to put someof these issues right."
1609595039,very fun
1609594610,"Fun gameplay, and storyline is really good. Tho some aspects of the game could be better!"
1609594875,"It's (really) imperfect, but there's a narrative in that imperfection that just got me. Can't wait to see how it patches, and where the DLC takes it. I don't blame anyone waiting for the quality of life improvements to land, but I think there's enough there now to make it a wonderful experience. I even found some of the bugs weirdly charming (like when my handgun disappeared and I roamed around killing enemies with fingerguns for a while). "
1609594954,"The number of bugs is just off scale.
An example of what they just tried to release, what they did not complete, there is a characteristic icon that does not exist. Why did she stay? Did you cut out the functionality that you could not implement so quickly? In general, there is too much expectation for something more cool, but here is what we got."
1609594443,"This game isn't perfect (graphical and physics glitches, poor AI, it wants to be too much of everything), but despite all of this I'm enjoing it a lot (great graphics, well paced and interesting story and well written charismatic characters). In my opinion it's better to wait until february, after the big patches' roll out, and then buy it. That's my review :)"
1609594344,"Having not watched development videos and trailers beyond what started popping up on TV just before launch, I accepted what the game had to offer to me. I love the narrative. A lot. Enough so, that I almost gave this game a positive review. I ran into a few bugs, most solved by just reloading my save - which btw - save A lot! - and some that pissed me off but had some fix I could easily pull up from google / YT. The game also has somewhat decent replayability to where I'll probably be able for force 200 hours out of it.

When I played, I was immersed in the narrative, both main game and side quests, and not exactly the world. If you're trying to immerse yourself in the world, you're wasting your time. It's not going to happen. It has nothing for you in this area. The AI is some of the worst I've seen in gaming period. YT can solve your curiosity on this end, there's just too many problems to start naming them. I'd probably literally run out of characters. 

The complaining about this game is entirely justified. When I look into what was promised, CDPR flat out lied to everyone and in a way tried to steal our money. I'm not exaggerating when I say that. Some of these issues are so big, I don't know if this game can be salvaged in a way that can lend them any forgiveness. If they didn't own the Witcher IP, I would go so far as to consider never buying another game from them."
1609594179,Good
1609593931,its very good the glitches are either over hyped or just console being worse than pc so either way i dont care.

1609965180,I've played 100h and almost cried when the game ended. Awesome story line.
1609593810,Would be better with future patches but overall still a great games.
1609593807,Great game even with all the bugs. A year from now everyone will still be playing it.

1609593771,is good
1609593751,"I like running around the city, replacing my organs with technology and shooting random thugs in the street. I also love playing Cyberpunk 2077."

1609593512,"I enjoyed it. Personally I think it's worth every penny (I paid 40USD  in my local currency).

Hope it will get better in the future!"
1609593502,"If this game was finished on release, it would've been better than GTA, Red Dead, The Witcher, you name it. 

The problem is, this game is not finished."
1609593495,"Really enjoyed the story and environment they made. Car driving not well optimized for keyboard but whatever.

Actually haven't had any game breaking bugs, and only see a few minor with no real effect in game play."
1609593380,"Honestly not as bad as all the publicity it's getting regarding bugs. Yes, They're there but they don't make the game unplayable. It's like ""Why the hell is that car falling out of the sky?"" and then it wont happen again for the next 10 hours. A lot of these are being fixed or have already been fixed recently as CDPR has been fantastic with releasing patches for the major game breaking bugs. Just don't try to play on anything less that the Playstation 4 Pro or Xbox One X (Xbox Series X & PC myself). 

Personally I think we need to cut CDPR some slack here. They delayed this game a few times telling us it wasn't ready & all we did was nag them to release it... Then they released it and we are nagging that it's not ready.

Summary = Fantastic Game after 35 hours played on PC (Street Kid) & many more on Xbox Series X (Nomad).  I will be purchasing this game again when i finally receive my Playstation 5 and will play through with a Corpo backstory."
1609593068,"90 hours into first playthrough; four T poses, zero crashes, NPC dialogues sometimes mutes or they talk over themselves and a couple of cars arriving damaged but other than that its a pretty solid game, maybe not GOTY worthy just yet but still enjoyable"
1609592849,"Despite the current bugs (mostly little things, not game breaking), still a great game. Currently 150 hours in and still having a blast."
1609592803,"We lost everything

1609592587,Works on my machine
1609592343,So far the experience with the game is great. Always run into some bugs but it doesn't ruin the game. looking forward for more fixes in the future to make this gem silky smooth!
1609592281,it is a fun game for people who like to explore and just have good old fun it also comes with a bonus of have three diffrent great stories to play as well.
1609592228,graphical draw distance
1609591587,good storyline and graphics but has a few big bugs
1609600654,"It's fair to say that the game was released too early in terms of optimizations and mechanics (vehicle physics, police etc) however as others have stated, there is an amazing foundation just screaming to come out. The story is brilliantly written, the concept of the world is fantastic and constantly drawing me back in to find more and more things and the soundtrack is spot on for the genre. I could go on about other things, there are unfortunately issues.

Putting all of the technical issues aside, the game is worth playing. It will undoubtedly go down in history as an amazing game. However, CDPR needs to be held to account for the mis-expectations they themselves set, or at the very least allowed to be made without correcting when the hype became far too much and unrealistic. Personally, I would have been fine with further delays with a bit of open transparency as to what the current situation of the build really was. Were they too ambitious with all of the platforms - for sure they were. The impact on the dev timeline with sorting the [i]PS4[/i] and [i]xBox One[/i] builds will be substantial, as this will take resources away from DLC and feature updates.

As someone who works in the software development world, I can say we call this ""expectation management"", which I feel was very poorly managed. They should have actively clarified things being discussed that they knew were incorrect rather than clearly try and add it into the scope of the game purely because people wanted it (this is called ""scope creep""). Personally, after seeing a proper cut scene in one of the endings (no spoilers, I won't say which one) I suspect the ""scope creep"" was actually the shift from 3rd person play with cut scenes to 1st person play with no cut scenes. Requiring a whole load of new animations needing to be re-done due to the different perspectives and interaction methods.

The debate as to whether the game / story would have been better as is or in 3rd person with cut scenes will always be a tough one, as for most people it will be down to a personal preference. So to appease the majority, the best option would have been to offer both, so that facial expressions of NPC's can be read either way, rather than persistent 3rd person.

All that being said, CDPR should be commended for their ambition with this title. It has so much potential with the lore, the future expansion possibilities, movies etc etc. They just need to tame their own expectations and control their scope. If more things were to be added, instead it should be planned out and brought in future iterations, releases, expansions etc. 

Suffice to say, the game is good, the story is well written and engaging and CDPR I suspect will have learned a lot of lessons from this experience that others in the industry should be paying very close attention to."
1609591366,"Awesome, but it doesn't rain enough. Cyberpunk is at its grimiest when its pouring rain. BladeRunner."
1609591341,"Cyberpunk 2077 gives the player the ultimate freedom to play. A video game that takes the best of modern RPG, first-person shooter, stealth and open world games and masterfully blends it into a single product."
1609591318,i mea it has bugs and glitches but for me that doesnt take away any fun !
1609590993,"The game is trash. This games antiquated game systems & terrible AI lets you know CDPR bit off more than they could chew. Based on what was released, this game needs three more years of development so CDPR can figure out proper AI for traffic, NPC’s & police.  They need to figure out how to make a living, breathing city that’s fun to muck around in. All the broken systems make night city a very dull place. The combat isn’t fun thanks to lackluster physics. The city is a static prop you walk through to get from one repetitive mission to another. All their effort was used on the six hour prologue & that’s the finished section they marketed. Everything else is a buggy mess. I wouldn’t recommend this game at all. No matter what CDPR fixes, this game will never become what we’ve grown accustomed to in triple A, open world games from rockstar or Ubisoft."
1609590933,Really epic!!! Has John Wick from Fortnite and lesbians
1609590871,"They get so many things wrong with this one, it's just disappointing. 

Get Witcher 3 instead."
1609590900,"I love this game, I really do, but I can not finish it due to a gamebreaking bug.
I didn't want to give it a negative review, but after this much playtime in a single playthrough without being able to finish it, I almost feel forced to do so.

TL;DR:  
Wait half a year until everything's fixed, then go buy it."
1609590740,this game missing lots of features really dissapointing and lots of bugs and problems on the way played for like 50-60 hours but game stopped counting hours and achivements not recommanding this game to anyone just wait for online and hope they fix this stupid broken game
1609590703,"Don't let the neckbeards and edge lords fool you, this is one of the most addictive and well written games since I've played since the revolutionary Deus ex...
IF seeing visual bugs on the off occasion like people in the background using invisible smartphones, or sitting on a invisible bench, or maybe even disappear themselves, then don't buy it and go back to your moms or aunts basement and make a better video game, I triple dare you."
1609590583,I was reluctant to get this game due to the poor quality reviews this is getting but I believe that is mainly for consoles. This is a solid game. At times it more of watching a movie because of the long conversations between NPCs but that is probably the only negative thing about this game for me. Very few bugs. The NPCs can act stupid at times during combat but overall I would give it an 8 out of 10.
1609590390,"The game scenario is ok, however the implementation of everything promised is way below the average."
1609590606,"There has been a lot of controversy over this game. But before I get into the review, let me say that I thoroughly enjoyed the game, even with its flaws.

I bought the game on release, and I was completely immersed. I must have been lucky because over my 60 hrs playtime I only had some minor bugs (T-pose for 1 second while driving a car and game crashing once or twice).

When you see videos online you see alot of glitches and bugs, so its your choice if you play the game with those bugs and glitches or wait for more patches.

Now onto the actual review:
Pros
[list]
    [*] Very immersive
    [*] Great albeit short story (If you focus on the main mission that is. I never used fast-travel and did about 60 hrs with a lot of side quests included.)
    [*] Great characters
    [*] Beautiful graphics and Blade Runner-like environments
[/list]
Cons:
[list]
    [*] Repetitive side-missions (they can be enjoyable, but can be a real grind if you want to complete all the achievements)
    [*] Very high system requirements
    [*] Bugs/glitches
[/list]

Final note:
This game left me with that bittersweet feeling after finishing the game. I only have this feeling with great games that can suck me in and get me to no-life for a couple of days. So I would definitely recommend it."
1609590324,"Initial bugs and glitches aside, the game delivers a great story driven adventure. Main missions are too short, but side missions and gigs are entertaining."
1609590150,"Gameplay has tons of room for improvment (Save game management, frigging quests for vehicules that keep coming, defaulting quest indicator to the Main quest kinda ""rushing"" you to the main storyline... Still, the city, the vibe, the storyline all of this is brillant and remind me of my P&P Cyberpunk session"
1609590078,"I really like this game so far, I know it is known to have glitches but so far I find them fun lol"
1609590031,A great game even in it's state as not really finished. Playing it right now and looking forward to playing it maybe in 2022.
1609590106,"It is an unfinished game. That's what I say.

Tbh I was disappointed once I actually get familiar with the game, There are too many people complain about bugs, braindead AI, irrelevant quests, stupid gear system and graphic issues. I am not gonna talk about it. I am gonna talk about the theme. 

This game created a cyberpunk world without ""cyberpunk"" at all if you look it in depth. The main quest line only tells a story about a crazy rebel's personal revenge. There is nothing to do with the player if the rebel is not in my brain. I don't feel any difference if the story happens in current time or even hundreds years ago. The core of the game, I mean massive open world, is not ""cyberpunk"" at all. 

I have to admit CDPR crafted a beautiful city with many details. At first impression, night city is stunning. Architects did a great job on planning a cyberpunk city. After that, there is no cyberpunk. The people, the citizens, are living a normal life just like any other massive open world game NPCs without any difference. 

I don't see the effects those mega corps did to people. Those mega corps are completely isolated out of the game. I can see people cursing them, player going against them, but where is the total control of daily life? Arasaka tower is just standing there and doing nothing. Militech and Kang Tao are just companies you can see anywhere else. Most of the time I am dealing with gangs not corps. My hatred towards corps mostly comes from Johnny Silverhand not myself. That's why I feel even a little bit weird at the final quest. Those are not mega corps that people hate but rely on. 

I don't see the actual struggle of lowlifes. The poors, including players, they supposed to struggle in this world. Joining gangs, manipulating bodies to get a job, even robbing others. There are some of them in game, like dolls and gangs, however, the most of citizens stay the same as usual. It is even funny to see people from downtown living the same life as people from slum area. And I almost forgot to mention those gangsters are everywhere even in corps controlled zones.

I don't see how inplants change people's life. I've read a little story in game about a sole mother sold her whole body to the corp and managed to switch to a machine so she could carry her child. Out of the story, nope, there is no such things. The dolls changed their neural system so it is not visible, but how about others? I can see some gangsters changed their arms or legs, that's it. More like cool looking appearance instead of vital effects. For players, we are able to add tons of inplants on body but non of them are even visible. Replacing them with magical enchantment makes no difference.

CDPR tried to make up these flaws in many ways, like tons of little stories and descriptions. But it's not enough. What we want is an actual cyberpunk world not little stories. This is a game not an e-reader! 

Regardless, I did enjoy this game. But there are so many flaws that can not be ignored."
1609589957,"Okay this took a while to write down, but here it is my review for CP2077!

Story/Narrative

The story starts off with you choosing your life paths, Street Kid, Corpo or Nomad, now as per marketing, CDPR would have you believe that these mattered a lot and it would affect how your narrative plays out based on their earlier videos. This is not the case however as after 100 hours worth of playtime I can safely say that it does not. The first few minutes of the lifepaths would have you believe that they do, but shortly after 30 mins it is all taken away from you and you are presented a montage of what CP2077 would have been and then the game thrusts you into the same starting point for everyone regardless of your initial life paths.

There are certain dialogue options that connect to your earlier life path or also mini quests but these are non consequential and don't really add up to much in the long run. 

The story is a simple Corpo bad and power corrupts narrative with a sprinkle of “what is the purpose of life” theme. The main story itself is pretty by the books with some key moments that were decent but ultimately towards the end, especially during the endings, the experience simply falls flat on its face as I felt like the endings were pretty half baked due to the fact that only one choice would lead to one (or two) side characters given satisfactory ends, while the rest ends up feeling like punishment for players who chose the other ending, there is also a blue-balling cliffhanger ending which really fails to deliver the effect it was aiming for. 

There is also supposedly a doom clock mechanic involved, but that was poorly implemented because it only affects you when the game says it does (during main quests), so that false sense of urgency was kinda pointless and just laughable as the game tries to add manufactured tension to what already is a pretty dull story. Sometimes your character would cough up blood randomly buttttt I only started doing the main missions at level 40+ and nothing happened so no worries about delaying the game.

All in all the main story does not impress and while some of the characters that you meet are interesting, most just aren't given enough time to develop for you to care enough when something does happen to them, or their quests just end abruptly with no follow up or closure whatsoever. Side quests are fun and some of them actually have proper conclusions. Others are cool at first but lead ultimately nowhere.

Gameplay

We’ve all seen the bug videos, and we all know that in its current state the game is ridiculously broken with enemies clipping through floors and you being sent flying through places and many more.However even if all this is fixed, the core gameplay itself is confused on what it wants to be, in one hand it feels like a wannabe looter shooter with very unsatisfying loot and very poor weapon variation...These weapons have random numbers and effects slapped on to them just for added effect which is fine but sometimes makes no fucking sense. For example, I love using the baseball bat, i think it’s cool, however I picked up a bat that was supposedly a NON-LETHAL weapon that rolled Bleeding properties which is a LETHAL type of damage, now this contradicts the main function of the damn bat as I end up killing most of my targets from the bleed damage...so we all know that this game clearly didn't go through much QA, however something basic like this shouldn't be overlooked right?

While on the other hand, it tries to be an RPG with deep meaningful choices both from a narrative and gameplay perspective but this is done in the most basic of manner as well. Choices that you make in the story does not affect the overall ending in any shape and form. It's not like in Mass Effect where if you have a low Strength Rating your destroy ending will end up in complete disaster with you wiping most of life in the Milky Way Galaxy or have friends die like in Mass Effect 2 final mission. The ending pretty much boils down to the final dialogue option given to you and that’s pretty much it. Most of it is not connected at all and some of the side characters don't even care or at least they pretend that they do, save for one side character which has an ending dedicated to her storyline alone. 

From a gameplay standpoint the perk mechanic is super half baked, some of the skills are really pointless like upgrading your lung capacity (the game never takes you underwater save for one mission) and the throwing knives to name a few while others are just simple stat boots or passives. 

Leveling up your character is easy but leveling up your skill that unlocks more stronger perks is difficult, by the end of the game I didn't even get to level 20 for any of my skills which shows how pointless the perk tree really is and how non consequential they really are to the overall experience of the game.

You can cyberpimp yourself up with weird modifications that boost armor and whatever but these also offer no sense of change in your aesthetic (except for the ugly mantis arms and gorilla arms I guess which are non retractable) but just as well, not like anyone reacts to you normally anyway. I tried to go for the human pathway, so I stayed away from modifying my V in any shape or form, but no one seems to praise me for that, even after I beat the boxing world champion with just my normal fists. The world fails to react to you in any meaningful way based on your choices and that just sucks. 

Other gameplay issues that i found include:

1) Terrible NPCs
2) Teleporting policemen (no wonder you never see them patrolling Night City)
3) Terrible AI in general
4) Boss fights are hilariously boring and easy 
5) Fixers are part time car salesmen
6) Delamain car (once you completed his questline) does not talk at all
7) Really bad clothes/armor mechanic 
8) Cars that you own do not display in the Garage of your apartment
9) Emails and phone mechanic is all fluff and serve as quest vehicles 
10) Physics? What basic physics? 
11) Lazy crafting implementation with simplistic customization (like a COD game back in the 1900 or 2000s)

There is also one mechanic where if you are very chummy with the major side characters, they will offer you the keys to their apartment or something. On the map it's called “Apartment” Now I saw one in the desert where one of the side characters group was chilling and I thought, “did I miss this apartment?” 

Turns out its just a stupid tent. CDPR labels this as an “Apartment” because it’s what your room is labeled as. Now, even more stupider is that you can't interact with anything in this “apartment” save from the mirror and a storage box. Now these offer no purpose whatsoever because storage is global, you can dump stuff in your car and it’ll appear at your apartment or vice-versa it’s quite odd that you would add random storage boxes in the middle of nowhere when I can just summon my car and do the same thing without even bothering to travel long distances.

Gameplay wise, I've gotta say it's pretty average, it does nothing to reinvent the formula or improve what was done while also doing some things hilariously worse than games that came out years ago

Graphics:

Setting is nice, it looks flashy and stuff. Looks definitely better than heroes 3! 

Overall opinion:

CP2077 is an average game, it does some things right while really failing in others. The story was okay at best and I do like some moments in the campaign, but the overall package just never left me wanting more. Not only that, because the lifepaths were pointless to begin with and offer no BIG difference in how the story plays out, there is just no incentive to go back to CP2077 and start a new game. It is a barebones experience and it's all style but no substance. If I had to slap a rating on it, CP2077 definitely earns a 5/10. Get it when it's 50% off, it’ll be worth it by that point….hopefully. 
"
1609589945,"A lot of people have been saying awful things about this game, and to be completely honest I was excited about this game for the last year, so I had to try it myself and not let other corrupt my opinion. Full disclosure; I have a pretty strong rig [ryzen9, 2700 super, 32gb memory]

I'm a little over a hundred hours in, and I have to say, I'm loving it. I was hooked on the Witcher type storyline with the million little side quests. There is a fairly wide selection of guns to play with (If you choose that style of play) but I've been having more fun with the legendary mantis blades and forcing everyone to commit suicide as I walk right by them.

Bugs/Glitches? Yeah, they exist. Like every other game on the market. I would consider it a 0.6Bethesda (meaning it has 60% of the glitches as a normal bethesda game). I have to give credit to the devs for quick patching and fixing things. It really is improving every day.

Don't listen to people running 8+ year old consoles complaining that the game is ""totally broken"". They finally get to experience not having proper hardware.
"
1609589904,GGHF
1609589928,"After wrapping up all of the content in the game at launch, I can say that while there are some little annoyances here and there that the core game and especially the story are incredible. The main story has great writing with really interesting characters and plot lines throughout. Given a bit of time for some extra polish and added content, this game will be looked at extremely fondly.

The bggest thing to know coming into this game is to expect something closer to a Witcher game set in the future than a GTA style sandbox. If you're looking for the latter, you may walk away disappointed."
1609589512,has glitches but still fun fps overall
1609589460,iyi bir bilgisayarınız varsa ve bugları göz ardı edebilirseniz çok zevk alırsınız
1609589319,"Futuristic, depressive, unfinished, gorgeous game-art picture..."
1609589020,Broken game!! don't buy.
1609588910,"so for me, this game is amazing, and one of the best games i have played in years. for me normally games like skyrim or even the witcher 3 felt like a game that dragged on and on. this doesnt have this issue and kept me wanting more and more. even at 160+ hours. highly recommended for ppl who want to get into a great futuristic world.
with that being said i do know there has been some big back lash for ppl who havent been playing on pc and even on pc there r some issues, like graphical issue, i have only had 2 crashes, falling thru the map(this happed to me once, it looked like the map didnt even load), some gigs and other side missions wouldnt finish( i hope this gets patched later and i can finish these) some missions wont load, they will tell you to sit and wait for a call that never comes (unless you close out the game and start again) one thing at always bothered me is that in some parts of the city feels empty and brakes immersion (i also hope this will get patched later on)

to conclude i found me experience great and i can look past some the these issues because the amount of fun i have had playing it."
1609588885,Although there was some bugs none of them hindered the experience of the game. Overall it was pretty fun and had a decent story.
1609589111,"If you've been following the marketing of this game via Youtubers or the marketing team at CDPR, prepare to be disappointed as there is lots of cut content and half-baked mechanics in this game. 

This game is not really an RPG, your choices do not matter for the most part for the story or the world at large. 

The game's story is extremely linear, with some multiple endings (think Mass Effect 3).

The game does have its moments in the story, and the action was fun towards the beginning.

If you go into this game with zero expectations, a decent gaming pc, and wait maybe a few months down the line, you will have a solid single player action-adventure experience, but probably wait for a sale.

However, with the game in its current buggy state and with the sort of false promises the marketing has created this game cannot be recommended in good faith. May revisit once the game is patched up in February."
1609588382,"i have a solid PC therefore i had a good experience, just become un-poor, you poors"
1609588196,Not worth at full price

1609587825,"Truely great game - only experienced few unimportant bugs on my setup. (Ryzen 1600x, 16GB Ram and GTX2060 and game on SSD). Not completed it yet, 30 hours in. Lives up to the hype in my openion."
1609587785,dont be a g0nk
1609587718,"A bit buggy, but that will get patched away. All in all: a masterpiece."
1609587717,"Very good game, didn't have any issues as of now.
Not as incredible as I expected, but I expected too much to be honest.
Still an amazing game! If you like Deus Ex, games about the future, deep RPGs, I highly recommend."
1609587680,"Running on a 1080ti at 1440p on high and i've had zero issues.
In my experience, the game is living up to it's potential. Couldn't be happier."
1609587581,Amazing
1609587729,"Cyberpunk 2077 is an ok'ish game but poor RPG. And certainly not ""a next generation of open world adventure"", quite behind the competition actually. Story and characters are the highlight of this title. If you stick to the main quest and scripted content you can actually get immersed for a bit before the game kicks you out from this oblivious state with bugs, bad design and poor technical state of open world. You get 3 lifepaths which are short and matter little. Endings are 5 afaik. 2 are always on the table, 2 you get from side quest and one you get if you are nice enough to Johnny. What happens at the end you decide in one conversation :)  So, I dare to say this game is pretty linear. 

World building is questionable. One of trailers highlighted gangs of the Night City. Do they matter? Do they give quest? Nope. Just targets for your guns. Kill 100 and they won't mind. Another highlighted NetWatch and the danger of pissing them off. You can also scrap that. They and the Voodoo Boys are in one mission and it doesn't matter who you kill and you can kill both. Trauma Team? They never drop by for the people you try to flatline. They do sometimes show up around a city which is nice. Perhaps Militech? The biggest foe of Arasaka also largely opts out of the game. Only Aldecaldos are fleshed out. 

Quality side missions are far and few between. Most of them are extremely boring (kill X, grab Y, release Z) with no story and rarely extend beyond one location. Missions where you have any branching choices are like... two?  By sheer coincidence the more fleshed ones were showcased before the release. I tried to do them all but at one point I simply had enough and decided to go for the ending. That said good stuff do exist, it is just very hard to find it on the map. Few examples. Repenting murderer is probably something people mention a lot. Another one is the search for Swedenborg-Rivera - very cheeky, my favorite. Both of them have no actual combat which is rare. Then there is a side story related to Jefferson Peralez which presents interesting conspiracy to work through but unfortunately does not give player any payoff and just leaves things hanging. Searching for detective Ward's nephew was also an impressive quest. 

AI in Cyberpunk 2077 is more A than I. Enemies behave poorly during combat. NPCs are just weirdly behaving background. Vehicles do not know what to do with themselves and, outside of the scripted content, player is the only person to ride a bike. Because AI is what it is wanted system is extremely simplistic as well. Badges just teleport behind your back and engage immediately. They do not give chase, do not ride cars, do not drop from AVs. Also far cry from corrupt police sending ""powerful people"" after the player which was promised.

Shooting is kind of fun, although you get very powerful, very quickly. Most of engagements offer very little in terms of targets. Usually like 5-6 hostiles max. The best mission in this regard is the infiltration of Arasaka's warehouse. We have large space to work with, lots of enemies and even a mech to shoot at :) I didn't try hard to melee but I had gorilla arms and it was fun to use them from time to time. Without committing yourself to certain perks you can die easily in a world where most enemies prefer to shoot. 

UI is Rockstar level bad. Wanna quickly check the map? Click M. Wanna go back to the game? M again? No! ESC. Twice! Minimap does not zoom out during driving therefor at high speeds you get your directions way too late. You can craft ammo in the game. But nowhere in the crafting menu you can see how much ammo do you have and how much you are crafting. You can push a button to answer calls... but if you don't the game answers calls anyway! xD Sometimes during other missions and/or conversations. My V had conversation with Judy while simultaneously talking to Delamain and with Goro while talking to detective Ward. And for the love of god, Regina, please stop harassing me with your calls. You have missions to acquire new means of transportation. Nothing exciting, you got to place X, pay for the car or bike and there you go. But in the mission menu you cannot see how all of that junk looks like. You have to go to another menu and find text message from your fixer. And so on.

Last thing. It is one of the most visually impressive games released so far. 

It is clear now why there was so precious little gameplay before the release and what we have seen was carefully edited. Clearly, large amounts of tomfoolery were flying behind the scene. Some day we will read a nice article about it. 

Do I recommend it? For the price, no! Wait and buy with a discount. By that time most bugs will be fixed. Unfortunately game will never be what was promised but at least it will be a decent experience."
1609587459,"While the game has some major flaws its still a small step forward from TW3.  The game is good, and with some more work from CDPR can be great.  I'm enjoying the game very much right now.  If your rig is going to struggle to run it don't feel bad about waiting."
1609587443,despite its performance issues as well as its buggy state it is still a awesome experience.
1609682512,"Shut up and take my money! 
I love every second of playing this game, enough to have pulled a few all-nighters. 

[h1]STORY[/h1] [b]11/10[/b]
The game has lots to do and lots of ways to do it paired with well designed story and dialog in both the main quest line and with side-quests. The best thing is that the side quests don't even feel like side quests. It seems that there are many paths giving the game some replayability.

[h1]CUSTOMISABILITY[/h1] [b]6/10[/b]
Beyond creating your character in the very beginning of the game, you're unable to customise anything about your characters physical appearance. You can change you're clothing and buy more clothes, however specs tend to take preference over style in these types of games, meaning not much luck in trying to look good. The game needs to add customisability to the character and the ability to change the look of items while keeping it's specs.

You an add mods to weapons and clothing to upgrade it's specs slightly.

There is no vehicle customisability, so can't change anything about your car - not even the colour. It would have been nice to also be able to add weapons and armour to vehicles and other vehicle upgrades.

[h1]WEAPONS[/h1] [b]10/10[/b]
The game has 9 classes of ranged weapons, each comes with it's own variants of 3 classes: [b]power[/b] - bullets can ricochet off of hard surfaces, [b]tech[/b] - can be charged to deal more damage, and [b]smart[/b] - auto-aim and target seeking bullets. Weapons can deal 4 types of damage: physical, electrical, chemical and thermal. That, along with an assortment of melee weapons, allows you to choose how to approach each situation.

[h1]DRIVING[/h1] [b]4/10[/b]
The driving system needs some improvements and the mini-map needs to be zoomed out a bit; I always miss the turns because it only appears on the mini-map at the last minute.

[h1]BUGS[/h1]
There are still quite a few bugs left in the game, but they've made a lot of progress in fixing bugs.

[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]
The game is great fun but could use a lot more customisability of both character appearances, armour appearances and overall vehicle upgrading."
1609587303,"After spending 100+ hours on hard, i'm willing to do it again"
1609587184,"great game it is buggy tho but its funny when you start flying in the air cuz u hit a car

I only played for 5h..................................................................totaly"
1609586851,"Even though the game has its limitations such as bugs and lack of immersive dialogues for some NPC, I still enjoy the game very much. Great graphics and storyline. The volume of quests is able to keep you busy for a few days. Love the futuristic concept of this game."
1609586822,"I played Cyberpunk 2077 on PC. My comments are based on my experience. My PC covers the recommended specs, but just.

The storyline is good and I enjoyed it till the ending, I wont give any spoilers, but I only enjoyed 1 ending, but I can understand the reasoning behind the rest.

Gameplay strengths:
-Side missions
-Gearing
-Character creation
-Skills and improvements
-Crafting
VIP: Visual details: Delightful

The game has bugs, but not such that I was slamming my head into the desk. Load a save game fixed many bugs, not all.

Bugs that don’t fix with workaround:
-Loot bug, some loot was visible, but you couldn’t receive it because it was not clickable. Common items, not a problem, but the more rare, the harder time I had to accept this bug.....EPIC / Legendary loot not clickable ARGGGHHHH
-NPC movement, some NPCS don’t walk around you, they clip through you. Not really great at times, but its a huge game. This creates issues in missions and battles, but some are being addressed if I read the new patch correctly.

Bugs which you solve via loading a save game:
-UI bugs: disappearing gear, disappearing mission steps, inventory issues, that scrolling over items give information outside your screen.....is the weapon iconic or not....arrggh, do I disassemble....
-Telephone calls stopping and not restarting, therefore missions bugging
etc

Improvements needed:
-Inventory: Disassembling common and uncommon loot could be made easier.
-Inventory: Filters and keeping the filter saved
-Minimap during driving: zoom in and out.....now corners do come up fast at 200kph.....
-NPC's jumping in front of you on your bike.....getting police on your arse due to these suiciding NPCS...hey not fair :P Not real problem at 1-2 star, try 4 star in the city.......DEATH
-More love interests please and more interaction with the love interest after the first commitment

Summary:
-I enjoyed myself on the first run through, except the ending like I mentioned. Hope this improves via a DLC.
-All in all a enjoyable game
-Maybe a bit pricy with the bugs, but I treated myself to a xmas present, so I accept it. I would recommend getting this game later on for those with a budget, not only for the discount but also for the patches bound to be incoming.

Score: 7/10 with bug improvements 8/10, with possible ending DLC 9/10. (I really don’t need dystopian endings in a dystopian game.

1609586706,"Pretty fun game if you enjoy games such as GTA V, however the bugs, especially on low level rigs are intrusive sometimes and it has crashed a couple times, I would recommend waiting to buy until the game is optimized properly.

1609586307,"If you go into this with the expectation set of ""this is basically The Witcher's systems and game structure"" then you'll have a blast. If you expect this to be the next GTA, disappointment awaits. Game difficulty and economy needs some serious rebalancing, but i honestly didnt play this to have a hardcore gameplay challenge. It gets as trivial as TW3's death march difficulty later on.

FWIW, I thoroughly recommend playing this at least once to experience the setting, the city, the people and their storylines."
1609585602,"I would absolutely recommend this game to pretty much everyone, but there are some things that need to be adressed first.

The Game:
- The gameplay is genuinely challenging at times 
- The game offers a vast array of styles to go with and play as
- The story is really good and can be completed easily, even if you haven't leveled up much. That doesn't mean it isn't challlenging it merely means that you are not kept from doing certain activities.
- The bugs are overeggaturated by pretty much everyone. When playing on PC i would say they do not bother you at all. 
- If you are easily annoyed by T-pose-bugs you might not want to play the game. It's the bug that occurs most frequently to me at least.

System requirements:
- My PC is quite bad (huge GPU bottleneck) so i can assess it's playability on mid to low settings quite well.
- When travelling at high speeds the game might struggle to properly render the terrain and the access points. 
- massive FPS drops whilst doing any sort of driving and even worse when driving and shooting.
- the graphics are still gorgeous at low settings.
- most story sequnces play ithout a hitch.
- you might want to upgrade your pc before playing this game, especially the GPU (i have a GTX 950 and it's a genuine piece of trash) 
- a bad PC doesn't keep you from playing the game but the experience might be compromised

Over all I can still recommend the game. The things that might be most annoying while playing the game aren't the bugs but the fact that most people won't be able to play at max settings with RTX on. 
Still. It's a wonderful game."

1609585430,"Playing this game feels like a first kiss - it can be awkward and clumsy at times, but it can also be an unforgettable and amazing experience.

11/10 - would crash through Night City sidewalks again."
1609585585,"While i enjoyed the game it really has a lot of flaws and is by no means a masterpiece in any shape or form.

The game is really jank and really buggy. While i personally didn't run into any game breaking bugs i can't deny that there were many graphical bugs.

The game runs pretty poorly (2070 super and a ryzen 7 3700x)

The game's combat is awful at the start of the game, mid way through ie levels 15-30 it is really fun using guns, and late game level 40-50 the combat is too easy and rarely presents a challenge.
The enemy AI is absolutely braindead and the enemy types dont offer much and dont really require much thinking to deal with. While i can't say much about melee combat i can say now that it feels really jank and somewhat not very viable.

The sidequests that are not gigs are interesting and offer nice tidbits and are worth doing, but gigs and reported crimes are very samey becoming a chore to do if you are trying to 100% the game.

The main story has a great hook and pulled me into the game. However upon reaching the third act and the finale of the game i can say without spoiling it that it really does not deliver falling rather flat.

Night city is really pretty at times and feels like a real city (that being a fucking shitty overcrowded place to live). However the npc's feel like a last minute thought being that they often freak out at the sight of a fist fight, scream for seemingly no reason, often only have one line of dialogue and overall just feel like CDPR didn't put enough time into them. The cop AI though has to be the worst offender being that cops will often become hostile for no reason, and spawn right next to you likely killing you in one hit, If not then they will drop in cops who are ALWAYS higher level than you even if you are at the level cap of fifty and then they will kill you.

I think what i enjoyed the most about the game was its characters like Judy, Panam, Takamura, Rogue, and Johnny Silverhand. The writing in terms of dialogue and character arcs feel really well done for the most part and to see where they would go as the story progress was the main driving factor for my vested interest in completing everything doing a 100 hour playthrough. 

The UI and crafting in this game is fucking awful it has to be one of if not the worst i have seen in a while. Being that your inventory is just a mess to go through, selling things is a pain, the map is pretty fucking ugly to look at, and the crafting system is awful being that you have to indiviually craft certain items. Say you would like to make 90 bullets so to go about this process you navigate to the crafting menu and make each bullet one by one and this process can take up to 15 mins because you are required to constantly click the craft item button. Not to mention that crafting can corrupt your save so that's cool thanks CDPR.

One big flaw in the game is that really surprised me was the actually RPG element of playing a character. With the Witcher games it felt that even if you were always playing as Geralt of Rivia, you could still make Geralt into whatever kind of person you saw fit. With this V just feels that same no matter the start, dialogue choices, and quest events. Most dialogue choices are the same no matter what you say, and if not its a simple binary choice of yes or no, option 1 or option 2.  This as a result makes the choices feel meaningless, and as a result lowered the replayability of the game. I'd compare it to fallout 4, but at the very least i enjoy the dialogue much more in this game than that shit excuse for a fallout game. 

Overall the game is just an unfinished mess and while i can say that my 60$ led to 100 hours of gameplay, a lot of it felt like fluff and by the end it felt meaningless, like no matter which of the 5 endings I chose none of them are really satisfying, none of them made me want to even bother playing the game again. Dont buy the game until at the very least the bugs are fixed. I would recommend that if you really want this game just wait till its fixed or on sale. if i had to give it a number a review it sits at a 6/10 being for me a better rpg than fallout 4 and outerworlds but overall just suffers from coming out of the oven undercooked.

TLDR buggy and jank af, unfinished, dissapointing endings, mediocre gunplay,"
1609585247,despite having some glitches here and there it is still a fun game with plenty to do if you want to just chill and  have fun.
1609584924,"This game is an all-rounder. Great graphics, gameplay, story, soundtrack, etc. As of 1.06, there are still a bunch of bugs that need squashing, but if you can look past that, you've got a real 10/10 on your hands."
1609584624,"This game is definetely the biggest gaming flop of the year. What they promised is non existent in the game, they even dare to compare to Gta 5 and rdr2, which is not even comparable by any means.  i get it its marketing purpose bla bla bla but it feels like... ARRRGGHH
Tons of glitches, broken pyshics, cops, people cars spawning out of nowhere? Geez the cops cannot even drive a car! Is this what 2077 looks like?? Definitely not worth for 89 dollars for my oppinion.

1609583520,"Well i made my playtrough and had 4 minor bugs. nothing gamebreaking. 

the game isn't complete but give it a few months. Im going to do another playtrough later on, rushed it now so i wouldn't get any spoilers from social media and my friends.
Cyberpunk have alot of replay value so you will get your moneys well worth.
it's stuffed with side missions, street events, Great lore and so on. i never felt like it wasn't something i could do.

i watched my friend playing this on the base PS4 and i can understand the hate cdpr gets for the consol version xD
but if you have a decent PC Cyberpunk 2077 is a must buy. if you are insecure just wait a few months and it will be a masterpiece. 

so just get in there and start your search for loot!

ONLY buy this if you're willing to pay 60 for what is basically a pre-alpha, unfinished game. I'm stupid like that, but if you're smart? Wait for a sale, or until they iron out the bugs (sadly I don't think it'll ever be as good as it could, would take too many changes)"

I died so many times by just slipping on a pebble... got stuck in the ground a couple of times, the GPS is a mess, the police system is a joke, the crafting is clunky and weird but it is useful... I loved the characters and wanted to come back and see how they are doing just for them to not be loaded properly, or be stuck in table, or T-posing. I hope they will fix and change some of the mechanics of the game, it has potential to be great."

1609582445,"I finished this game in a week (at least my first play through) and at time of writing this review, I've got about 64hrs played.

I've been waiting years for this game. I'm putting it out there, I was definitely hyped. 

I enjoyed just about every moment of game play. I enjoyed the story, though I'll note that there in some areas it felt like they ran out of time to flesh some of the side stories.

I feel like after you enter a relationship with your love interest the game doesn't give you any more story things to do with them till the very end of the game. The get put on a shelf and you have minimal interactions with them. Would have been nice to have been able to have this fleshed out a bit more. Also, the restrictions on the love interests was not a great idea. That's a bit minor.

I'm a big Bladerunner fan and getting to explore Night City was a real treat. I did feel like they oversold how alive the game would feel, as NPCs weren't really alive, they just existed and Night City was more like really immersive wallpaper than a lived in city.

The enemy AI was pretty mediocre and I think CDPR needs to improve here, they didn't do a good job in the Witcher 3 when it came to enemy AI and I see this is a weakness in this game as well.

Boss battles were so-so.

AND IN A GAME WHERE STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE IS KEY WHY CAN'T I CUSTOMISE MY CHARACTER IN-GAME!

These are my biggest criticisms of the game. I just wanted more story to play through because as usual CDPR nailed the story telling. 

There were some bugs that I experienced (notably one where I couldn't draw a weapon) and the game still feels rough around the edges when it comes to performance but I'm sure they'll improve this with time.

Otherwise, this game was fantastic and I was sucked in and now I hope they make more Cyberpunk games."

1609581328,"The good: It has a solid story line, incredibly atmospheric, aesthetically beautiful, great soundtrack, enjoyable gunplay mechanics. 

The bad: The bugs, holy shit there are some bugs... Too many to list, not really gamebreaking as in will lock you out of the story but it is annoying to have to load previous checkpoints because you glitched through the floor of arasaka towers lobby. 

Or recalling your vehicle only to have it spawn clipped into another vehicle causing it to explode and costing you eddies for your insurance excess. 

The ugly: The only favorable reviews you will find of this will be from PC users with hefty machines that are capable of running it. The console release of CP2077 will have left a bitter taste in a lot of peoples mouths and will take a no man's sky-esque redemption arc to heal their reputation.

1609581235,"Few bugs here and there but overall quite an enjoyable game, if you go into all the side gigs the play time is going to end up huge. I'm already keen for my next run through"
1609581171,very nice game
1609581142,"I would be hard-pressed to give you a single feature in this game that feels polished and complete. The story elements are patronising, simplistic and oddly behind the times for a future where anyone can be anything. Romance options are ... they're meet 'n' fuck. [b]But[/b], despite all that, this game has the bones of a masterpiece, a genuinely fun game conceived in a new and fresh way. I'm sad that this is how it was released. Cyberpunk is a good to very good game, when it should be an incredible game."
1609661700,"To start off, there are too many bugs to count. I found myself having to reload save files so many times to repair annoying bugs that make playing irritating (one time after a dialogue section and a ""vision"" - I'll call it that to avoid spoilers - I had loud rock music on loop while I was continuing dialogue and gameplay, making it virtually impossible to understand the npcs and broke the immersion immediately).
 
The World is absolutely dead, and the AI are so stupid it makes me cringe when I look at games as old as GTA 4 (which came out in 2008). Enemies will sometimes fall asleep mid combat and completely disregard me; they'll just stay idle in cover. The civilian npcs have no daily routines like RDR2 npcs do. Instead, they are lifeless, walking beings with the same few idle animations. The cops spawn behind you about 2 seconds after you commit a crime (even though civilian AI runs right into line of fire while I'm firing at enemies) and the worst part is that they can't chase you the moment you drive away in your vehicle! They literally cannot drive after you!! Great next generation experience am I right?

The attention to detail is absolutely terrible for effects and physics. Watch any youtube video comparing this game to GTA 5 and you'll see. The graphics are both fantastic and bad at the same time. I ran this game on i7-9700K and RTX 2070S with 1080p at its highest settings, ray tracing on ultra, and DLSS on quality and I was getting mostly 50fps (so, even though the recommended gpu is a 1060, don't expect much at all unless you really turn the settings down). RTX effects look great, especially in confined spaces and darker areas where its full lighting potential is at its peak. In the open environment, ray tracing falls off and render distance is so low. During a certain point, I was using a drone to recon an area for a mission and when I got high enough, the ground textures looked like something out of HL2. Sometimes some textures don't even load in when I'm standing in front of them (I'm using an M.2 SSD). I also want to note that V's shadow is a total abomination and shows the terrible comprehension of the human anatomy (shadow shows how stiff your body is and how your joints often get dislocated while aiming a gun lol...and watching your animations through V's shadow while underwater is just demonic). Car driving is a hit or miss. The cars drive okay but the suspension physics make it annoying at times to drive because the control is all over the place from the bouncy car.

The gameplay is alright with guns for the most part but melee is just bad. I used mantis blades in my gameplay and their animations are terrible (imagine a cat fight). There aren't any dynamic slicing animations that change your motion as you continue to slice, like in Jedi Fallen Order. If you use a katana its a little more enjoyable but not enough to call it great melee experience. I will say that if you have gore effects on, the slicing dismemberment is more dynamic than I thought with body parts being cut off at a couple different preset lengths depending on where you strike. 

The story is really good at the beginning (imo) but is too short and not nearly enough action to make it worth the ending. I ended up finishing the story in about 19hrs, and a good amount of it was dialogue and walk-and-talk. I'm a huge advocate for deep character development and story-focused gameplay, but the gameplay was mostly all the same stealth + combat + driving and shooting stuff.  The side missions are mostly the same stuff as well: rescue someone/something, sabotage someone/something, eliminate someone, and mystery (which mostly turns out to be one of the types listed already). There are a few mystery side missions that turn out be something bigger than I expected, and a couple of those turn into great, mini, 1-3 missions long stories...but these are sadly the very small minority of side missions. It feels like side missions are mostly there to give you some money and exp to buy more vehicles and gear and level up your abilities. 

I also want to quickly add that the ending of the story was just not worth the time and lead up.

_____________________________________SPOILER_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
I'd just like to say that in the end of the story, V in some way leaves the city for good. Because of this, when you finish the game, it prompts you to end the game, or load a save file before the epilogue to continue doing side missions or anything else. This literally lost me 1hr in the epilogue of picking up items and upgrading my abilities and gear, because it didn't matter in the end, it would just all disappear and you would revert to your old save file gear...mildly frustrating game design. It also made me feel like the ending was for nothing because I would just end up on a previous save file (not to mention that you can literally redo the epilogue as many times as you want because of the fact that it literally just takes you to an old save file after you finish the game, like really?). There's no feeling of change, no feeling of accomplishment, unlike GTA 5 where you finish the story and your end decisions and ending dictate how your gameplay plays out (aka kill michael, trevor, or death wish).

That being said about the story and world, this game could have easily been a linear story game but also give you a small level of exploration, like uncharted. I say this because the open world feature barely gives it any more life at all, and when an open world offers barely anything more to a game, that's how you know the open world design failed.

I don't recommend this game unless they miraculously upgrade its performance, AI, open world liveliness, physics + animations, and attention to detail...but obviously that's not likely at all; too many complications and bugs would most likely accompany that.

My verdict for this game as of right now is a 6/10. With all of these problems, they managed to get more than a 5/10 because the story characters were very well chosen, designed, voice acted, and paced. If I left anything out, Ill try to add in more stuff, or let me know!"

"
1609580200,A raw and unpolished gem. Still a gem nonetheless.
1609580110,I wanted to like the game because I got nothing else to play. Sadly I just cannot continue playing due to game crashing bugs. Once trying to get through a door in a mission. Then while on a mission with a dude looking at a tv in a diner. It just keeps crashing and I no longer have the will to try and get the game not to crash. The first door crashing boss crushed my soul after crashing my High End Gaming PC 7 times.
1609579996,"The game is surprisingly less buggy then I thought (well duh hot fixes). Practically every gun is powerful enough to kill someone and has weapons for every play style. It's a bit hard to perform stealth in this game but as long as you have enough room to sneak around and distracting objects in the right place, you are set. I wish there were more ways to grab eddies though. 8/10"

1609579286,"obviously the game has a lot of glitches and problems, i tried to not let that distract me from the total value of the game itself. i found the game to be a lot of fun even with the glitches they gave it a certain charm like how skyrim is a wonderful game even though to this day it has plenty. the main story is great with an even better ending that had me for the first time in a while emotionally invested in the characters you play with."

1609578809,"I followed the guide from Panjno on Youtube to make the FPS playable. I had been watching a playthrough of this game and hadn't intended on buying it.

Maybe experts do not think this is a good game, but for casual players like me, it's great."

(с любовью братьям славянам *рикардо*)

The main plot, the scenario and the setting of this game will not leave anyone indifferent.
It's gonna become a masterpiece, but it needs a couple of months to be patched and fixed to do so.

"
1609577902,"TL;DR I cannot recommend this game now. They really need to fix the bugs and apply some performance optimizations, which the promised update should deliver in January and February 2021. Also, you need to manage your expectation about how your choice matters towards the storyline -- it does not matter as much as it was marketed.

1. Combat: enjoyable but can be too easy at certain point. You really can choose the way you want to engage with your enemies. I personally prefer fast-paced combat with handguns/revolvers and melee weapons, and I find this game can bring that combat experience which I love. The thing is, once I have got one overpowered ranged weapon with 1k++ DPS, high crit rate and high crit damage in the game (which you certainly will, even when you are not on the max level yet), the game can feel too easy even on its highest difficulty level.

2. Story: I have mixed feelings about the story experience in this game. The storyline is good, have several prologues and endings which I found intriguing. But, I think, my choices along the story is not as influental as marketed before the launch. It still feels scripted.

3. Performance: It's certainly a next-gen game with all the bell and whistles in the graphics, which can be very demanding on older machines. But, I think, this game still can be optimized to run smoother. E.g. they have not enabled SMT on my Ryzen 7 3700X which can give over 10% frame rate improvement when paired with the latest-gen GPU.

4. Bugs: Bugs occured quite often. Most of them can be circumvented through loading from the last checkpoint or restarting the game so make sure you do quick save often."
1609577311,"This game is what I always imagined Cyberpunk would be like back when I played the pen and paper tabletop RPG the world is based on, and that's a special kind of magic for me."
1609577192,u get your money worth as hrs and hrs of gaming
1609577044,"Sure, at this point in time there may be bugs in the game here and there, but that does not stop Cyberpunk from being another hit from CD Projekt Red. As long as your PC has got the specs, it'll run the game with no hitches. Enabling DLSS in the settings should also help."
1609576979,Really great game.  I know there is a lot of static over last generation console play but on PC this thing is the next level of gaming.
1609576958,"very fun, bugs sometimes make things even more entertaining"
1609576955,its okay :/
1609576899,"A truly beautiful and awesome game, regardless of the bugs and unpolished content.

If you leave behind the fact that yes, this game is a bit unpolished and rushed, you are in for a beautiful graphical experience and an even better story and content. This game looks absolutely stunning and we would be rude not to say so. Its story is great, Keanu Reeves is fun and badass. It is a combination of Bladerunner with Deus Ex Mankind Divided, at least this is the vibe I got from it, which I am a total fan of. 

All in all, if you can get past the occasional bugs here and there and just focus on the experience, story, gameplay and visuals, you are in for an awesome experience and story!

Kudos to CD Projekt Red for this awesome game!"
1609576841,"Great game, but needs a lot of work.  Maybe wait a couple of months for the developers to address all the bugs (many of which are pretty disruptive)."

1609576771,"not really a next gen experience/overhyped, take those away and you got yourself a decent fallout 4 clone"
1609576743,"despite the bugs, this game is amazing. cant stop playing it. CPR may have been a bit ambitious with the time frame but there is no doubt they know how to make an epic game."
1609576570,One of the best games I've played in a minute
1609576517,i like the sword
1609576253,I genuinely really loved this game. There definitely were a lot of bugs but they didn't take away from my enjoyment of the game at all
1609576224,"I hope this comes across as a fair and balanced review.

This game has a lot of flaws, bugs, and there are many valid criticisms. What this game suffers from the most though is 10 years of hype. No product can stand up to that kind of expectation. Add to this that there are advertised features that are completely missing, bugs and glitches with basic mechanics, and design choices that just don't make sense. 

However, if I had never heard of this game until the first day I played it, I would judge this as a great game. I still think its worth the money I payed for it. To be fair, I am the type of person that once I've decided I want to enjoy something, I'm good at overlooking the petty flaws and I just enjoy it. And that's what you need to do with this game. If that doesn't sound like something you can do then go ahead and skip this game. But you'll be missing out on some truly gratifying experiences. 

This is a good game, its just not the game we were promised."
1609576114,It's a buggy mess with a lot of potential if they patch up the issues and fulfill a multitude of absent promised features.  The game is visually stunning and a conceptual triumph all while being a technical failure.
1609576081,"First off, let me start by saying: This game wasn't meant for last gen consoles.  It simply wasn't, and CDPR probably would have benefited from waiting one more year, and marketing the game for next gen consoles.  If you played this game on a last gen console and had a terrible experience, I VALIDATE YOUR PAIN AND WOULD BE PISSED AS HELL IN YOUR POSITION.

That said, the game itself is quite enjoyable.  Could it be fleshed out more?  Yes, absolutely.  I think the main quest is kind of weak, and the AI definitely needs some smart pills.

On the other hand, there are glimpses of utter greatness in this game.  Some of the side quests are quite engaging and interesting: One side-quest has you explore the mind of a serial killer in order to find a child he'd abducted, and that was probably some of the most immersive and intriguing gaming I've ever experienced in my roughly 40 years of exploring video games.  As I'd stated in previous paragraphs, CDPR would have benefited from the extra year to flesh out the main story, which is, admittedly, kind of weak.

But is the game worth playing in its current state?  *I* would say yes.  Maybe not for the full $60 at this time, but if they iron out the bugs (*most* of which I found laughable -- immersion breaking? Yes.  Game breaking?  Naw) then I'd argue it would be.

Bottom line: Would I recommend it?  Yes, but with caveats, and if those caveats don't bother you, then you will probably enjoy the game."
1609576014,fallout and bladerunner had a love child in 2077
1609576006,"I don;t like how the game ends, and there are A LOT of bugs that need to be worked out, but in spite of that I like the game."
1609575857,"6.5/10 
It's alright, maybe if the fix the game it will be a 7. Over hyped as hell and kinda boring after a good 30 hours. Good story though."
1609590311,"[h1]An honest review by someone who has 253 hours into the game and had no expectations going into it.[/h1]

FWIW, I have 253 hours into this game (as of posting this) and have had very few bugs that weren't visual. No game or major quest breaking bugs. I have had one quest bug where I was unable to start a side job (it just won't start), but that's it. So I won't get into bugs too much as I just haven't had many.

I think my perspective may be a bit unique as I wasn't one of the diehards following CP2077 for the last eight or whatever years. Of course I was aware of it, but I wasn't really invested in it at all. It was one of those ""well that looks neat, if I remember I'll grab it when it comes out"" kind of things. When it came out I was out of town, so I picked it up a few days later.

[u][b]The TLDR for the game for me is this: [/b][/u]

It's a combat oriented game in an incredibly immersive world where if you are the type of person who likes to just step back, explore and poke around, you will really enjoy yourself (I am this kind of person).

[u][b]Things they are doing right:[/b][/u]

Immersive world and overall feel of the environment. I think they nailed it, it feels dirty and grungy and really immersive. I enjoy just driving around and stopping and digging around in places (I've found an incredible amount of stuff doing that). 

The skill system is good in design, altho some trees are more useful than others, but I suppose that depends on playstyle. If you enjoy crafting in games (I really do) you will really like it in this game as it's arguably the most powerful thing in the game from an item/currency standpoint.  I really enjoyed the crafting/tech/stealth/quickhack playstyle, it was very engaging and fun for me.

The combat is better than most games of this genre IMO. The shooting feels surprisingly good and snappy, even better once you get some of the perks. It's not as good as A list shooters like Destiny, but it's surprisingly good. Never did I just think to myself ""god this feels like shit"". If I had to criticize one thing about the shooting, when you are scoped in sniping, for whatever reason the reticle will wander around whether or not you are, which is annoying.

I dig the idea of collecting stuff (cars, V's gun wall, etc). Cars in general have been really fun as have ""borrowing"" them (I drove a huge Arasaka truck around all day hah).

All of the side quests/gigs and how surprisingly extensive some of them are was very cool. Some were almost deeper than the main storyline in some were kind of shocking and surprising. 

In general you can play it as objective based as you want, or you can just roam around and handle things as you come upon them. It's fairly freeform in this regard, but I do feel like if you just strictly follow objectives and fast travel everywhere you're kind of missing the point.

[u][b]Things I'd like to see changed or added/fixed: [/b][/u]

The biggest thing that needs improvement for me is driving cars with kb/m. Mouse steering should have been an option, simple as that. They did it with the Basilisk so clearly it's there. While I have gotten quite good at driving with WASD, it still sucks.

Currently there's really no end game. Once you max out stuff, everything becomes very easy with essentially any build even on very hard difficulty. It would take some fundamental gameplay changes to fix that, hopefully they think about it.

Not being able to bulk craft things is very tedious. I made mouse macros so my index finger doesn't fall off, but it does take a long time if I'm crafting a few thousand whatevers just to disassemble them.

Items you want to keep/not accidentally disassemble need to be lockable some how. I have not (thankfully) disassembled anything I didn't want to, but I have come very close. A simple lock mechanism would solve this.

Not being able to buy/purchase property. I was really hoping you'd be able to buy property around Night City or the surrounding areas as you acquire wealth. It would be fun to do.

There really should be a news only radio station. Every time I'm driving around listening to the radio and news blurbs come on, I find that to be the most interesting part of the radio. I love all the crazy new stories they come up with. I'd much rather hear that than the music most of the time.

In general there are a lot of things that are poorly explained, or not at all, that could use better explanation in game. Reddit has come to the rescue more than once.

Having played through with both male and female avatars, the selection of clothing for V vs. what the NPC's are wearing is really frustrating.  ALL clothing that all characters in the game are wearing should be available by some means for V. Simple as that.

Crafting has a few problems:

There is an issue with disassembling things sometimes where they just lockup and you can no longer disassemble that item. This has happened to me on more than one occasion and sometimes I can fix it, sometimes I can't.

Also I feel like there's a bug with clothing vendors at the high end. Once I purchase any legendary spec's for clothes from them, I never see them again at any vendor ever. That needs to be addressed. As someone who loves crafting and collecting this is a real bummer. 

Crafting and how the various levels of it work could be better clarified.

[u][b]Summary[/b][/u]

All in all, I am really enjoying Cyberpunk 2077. I find it very immersive and engaging and honestly, most of the time the visual bugs just make me laugh, I don't care that much. I would like to see some of the systems fixed and some options for repeatable end game content (maybe repeatable procedurally generated NCPD gigs or something) and more stuff to collect (namely property, but more cars would be cool too).

I read a lot of the hate posts about it here and on Reddit and I just don't get it. Maybe they were super invested, I don't know. But I'm really enjoying it. Is it perfect? No, but what game is? I play a lot of Destiny 2 also, and honestly that game has way more game breaking bugs in it than Cyberpunk does, not even kidding. :)

So if you enjoy wandering and exploring and just seeing everything you'll really enjoy the game. If you are the kind of person to do objectives as quickly as possible and are going to blow through the main campaign as fast as you can, you'll probably not  have fun because honestly, the main campaign is not the meat of the game. There's so much more. 

As of right now, I would recommend it and I give it a solid 8/10.

Cheers. :)"
1609583947,"This game has some serious issues. It is JANK, clearly rushed, and I believe it needed another year of development time.

That being said - I still have greatly enjoyed my experience, it's one of my favorite games, and I highly recommend it. I would advise two things:

A: If you can wait awhile for this game to receive some patches, do it.
B: Ensure your PC is going to be able to run the game well enough to satisfy you, it took a bunch of jiggering for me to get it to run properly with my build that was well inside of the recommended specs for my resolution. (I've since upgraded my build and it runs great now, but I have an overkill of a GPU being a 3090.)"
1609575639,buggy game with a ton of heart and soul put into it. its worth it if you want something memorable
1609575563,"Glitches can and will be game breaking. But if you can google through that, in my opinion there's a really rich and solid storyline underneath it. I know people are getting refunds and all that, however, I really enjoyed it and don't regret the purchase."
1609575312,better than what people usually say. Would recommend.
1609575273,bad
1609575730,"TLDR: take other people's opinions on the game with a grain of salt because people have different grievances that you may or may not even experience personally. With that said, I will try to be as objective in my rating for this game, so read more if you're curious about my take.

The most obvious thing about this review is that I gave it a thumbs down despite having over 120 hours at time of the review. Stick around to find out why.

Let's get the obvious junk out of the way first because it's what most people are gonna gripe about in other reviews and I'm sure you're tired of hearing about issues that can be fixed in due time-- yes, the launch was one of the worst in gaming history, rivaling even Fallout 76 and No Man's Sky. The game at launch was very buggy and flat out didn't even work for some people. With that said, I am not including these issues in my review. I will completely tune them out and write this review as if I am analyzing a perfectly polished version of Cyberpunk 2077 (you know, the one we were promised lol). In doing so, I will explain why I think this game fell short on its content alone, even without the help of bugs dragging it down. 

-----NOW TO THE MEAT OF THE ACTUAL REVIEW-----

THE STORY:
I actually liked the main story a bit, but it was no where near a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination.  The best part of the story was that the main characters were done relatively nicely and some of the relationships/friendships felt kinda real and believable to a degree, but they were not ground breaking. In other words, the character depth and growth is pretty decent, but does not compare to masterpieces like Red Dead Redemption 2. I also feel like CDPR was REALLY banking on the audience loving Keanu Reeves, because  Silverhand is a MAJOR part of this game. Personally, his performance in the game is like a solid 4/10, but Keanu-chan irl is the GOAT so I enjoyed his character simply out of pure bias. V's performance was pretty good and I have no real complaints, but I wasn't blown away either. Panam is best girl tho. 

ZA WARUDO:
The world is breathtaking and sometimes I have to pause and just take in the view. However, if you stare too long, you'll start to realize some of the BIGGEST issues this game suffers from. This big beautiful world is unbelievably superficial. If you watch people, cars, gangs, cops, etc., you'll realize that nobody is going anywhere or doing anything. They are just pretending to be NPC's. Does that make sense? It's tough to explain but I'll try. If you follow a pedestrian around, they go nowhere, do nothing, interact with nothing, and essentially say nothing (unless you consider the same 3 lines of dialogue ""something""). If you attack them, instead of reacting like a living human (ie, unpredictable), they will literally do 1 of 3 things: Crouch on the spot and despawn, run away and despawn, or simply skip all the BS and despawn right before your very eyes. Not only that, but the buildings are incredibly shallow too. There are some amazing structures in this game, but I would say you can enter probably less than 5% of all buildings. I was promised from CDPR that the level of exploration would be unheard of-- being able to explore every nook and cranny of almost any building the eye can see. Well that was a fuccin lie. Also, don't ever pay too close attention to traffic in the distance because the cars just despawn after like 5 seconds of screen time (i'll talk more about the cars in the driving section). Now it is important to mention cause I know someone will argue this: despawning assests is not a bug, its a feature-- a bad feature. 

NOT AN RPG:
So this game was originally marketed as an RPG, but the RPG tag was apparently removed at launch. I suppose it is more accurate that way anyhow. This game is most certainly not an RPG. It is a shooter, basically. This is because of the lack of thought and care put into the player character development and progression. Pretty much any ""build"" in this game is able to steamroll anything and everything with no effort. My first build was a sneak crit pistol build, but once I realized that I was doing 1.2 million damage on a single shot, I realized I broke the game. I switched to melee, but the problem was the exact same. As was with any other build I tried. They did not put any effort into unique and USABLE skills. I mean, what's the point of having all this cool cyberwear stuff if the enemy dies from a single hit? Speaking of cyberwear, most of it is kinda interesting, but functions solely as x% increase to [arbitrary stat]. It is super topical and not really worth talking about much-- with the exception of the arms and legs, which actually add new dynamics to the game depending on what you get and how they're used. 


NOT A LIVING WORLD:
I kinda mentioned this when I talked about the world and NPC's in general, but I feel this needs special attention. The actions V makes seem to have almost no impact on the world around her. With max street cred, you would imagine rival gang members would put hits out on you, or pedestrians would know who you are and be afraid or respectful, or the cops would have a warrant for you.... but no, street cred literally does nothing for you other than give access to items. And while I am on the topic of gangs and the streets, why does it seem like none of the gangs ever interact outside of scripted events like missions, assaults in progress, and NCPD hustles? There should be random encounters all over the city, but there almost never are. 

THA PIGGIES:
The cops in this game are worthless. They do nothing for 99.9999% of the time, but if you shoot one civilian, you'll have the entire NCPD spawn behind you and instakill you. There's also no bounty system either. So as long as you walk like 10 feet away from your mass shooting, the cops forget it ever happened. WTF. 


DRIVING:
The driving in the game is horrendous. The controls feel like my car is being controlled by a massive toddler who picked up my car like a hot-wheels toy and skates it across lanes, making all sorts of unnatural movements. I mean really, who designed the controls? You make one small turn and you fish tail out like a mf. Not only are the controls frustrating, but the lack of car customization is ridiculous too. You can only buy cars, not customize them. Also, this is a decent enough spot to talk about this game's ""traffic"" or lack thereof. So this game has no traffic system AT ALL. Every light you approach instantly turns green, and any cars that turn off the main road you're on just despawn. Furthermore, if you park your car in the middle of the road, it will back up traffic because the AI of the other drivers is not sophisticated enough to just drive around (or crash into i guess). 


ALL IN ALL:
So, I guess all in all, my main issues with this game are just oversight issues and lack of attention to detail. I would compare this game to a college group project final submission where the group had several months to do the work, but tried to do it all in a single night. And when it was time to present the project, they forgot the flashdrive at their apartment and had to present the project late, but when they finally bring the flashdrive to class, the flashdrive breaks so they have to postpone the presentation again. But when they finally bring a working flashdrive to class a week after the due date, the file is the rough draft instead of the final draft. I think you get the picture. CDPR really fumbled this shit hard. 


There's probably a ton more I forgot to even mention, but I've said enough. I REALLY wanted to love this game. And its kind fun, sure, but I can't recommend it to anyone rn."
1609575079,"Its aWesome
"
1609576953,"The game is riddled with Bugs and (artifacts), terrible banding all the time even with a GEFORCE RTX 2070... There is BARELY any nudity (a complete LIE from CDPR). You can barely edit your genitalia but it is pointless considering your character constantly wears underwear, even in (adult) scenes... don't ask me how humanity still exists in that world, undies get all the (results). The ONLY place you will see yourself rid of all clothes is in your inventory page... The endings are terrible, don't expect a good ending, there aren't any (even the special unlockable ones. (IMO) If you're buying this game for nudity, you will be extremely disappointed ! The adult parts of this game are basically a LOT of swearing, violence and gore, those are in abundance and are not lacking, there is also an abundance of sexual themes and some PARTIAL nudity, that's it. Children in the game are there to TROLL you, they are untouchable (almost), are constantly in the way, walking like they are all depressed and/or injured, NEVER have any parents with them and constantly spew stupid comments at your character...they suddenly VANISH once you get in/on any vehicle. To be VERY honest, considering what a complete lunatic city Night City is, I wouldn't let my children go out alone in that city, not at all realistic... Yet they are always alone... Don't expect any animals either, they don't exist for whatever lazy reason. the ONLY thing you will see is the same Cat (Sphynx) a few times (3) and that's it  Oh wait, you will see cockroaches/flies and ONE bird...  The cops are beyond stupid and utterly useless, they  will FIRE at you for any slight mistake (including just walking too close) and even just by going to a drop point to sell your stuff. If you have a police warrant on you, they will literally spawn randomly out of anywhere, even WALLS, NO joke ! . There is a lot to do in the game which is a positive aspect but the vast abundance of ridiculous bugs make this hard to play and renders a few gigs and side quests impossible to finish.  This game was CLEARLY NOT ready to be released and it shows ! You can have the best graphics card in the world and you will still have trees and artifacts all over the place, sometimes making it almost impossible to see anything or target enemies because you have paint/trees all over the place just popping up and glitching like crazy.. I keep seeing BIG hotfixes ranging in the 16-17 GIGS but I don't get ANY of them and don't see ANY changes whatsoever. The Game has potential but they left it out the door when launched. In all honesty, a huge disappointment ! I was expecting to be awed in graphics, realism and MATURE CONTENT and I was incredibly disappointed and frustrated !  a Huge let down ! Again, if you're getting this game expecting a lot of adult oriented material, you will severely disappointed, It's a huge lie ! You cannot even edit your character once made, NO haircuts possible, no Tattoo parlors (ridiculous I know), you CANNOT edit your cars at all, paint jobs are sometimes awful If I were to give this game a rating (between 1 to 10 (10 being the best), it would go as is: Graphics 5/10, Bugs/glitches 1/10, game play (ignoring bugs and graphic issues: 7/10, storyline 5/10 (absolute terrible endings), Voice acting: 8/10 (lots of variety and languages), Explanation of movement and controls: 4/10 (very confusing at first), Adult content/language: 10/10, Adult content/violence and gore: 10/10, adult content/XXX: 3/10.  Considering all I've seen in the game (I'm level 50/50, have done every single gig/crime/sub quest on the entire map, would I recommend this game for other people for the price paid of 88$(cdn) ?  NO !"
1609575047,"Playable...

Wait for the patches for cut features...

Just think of this as the Beta version of the game...

lul"
1609574962,Not that fun. doesn't even  look close to how it was advertised when playing it on my $2000 PC
1609574933,all their ads were fake.
1609574912,RECOMMEND
1609574752,"Real life cops should take notes from the omniscient NCPD, will catch you anywhere anytime no matter how small the crime. 

For real though, most bugs are annoying but doesn't ruin the overall experience, underwater candles and T poses may just become a thing 56 years from now."
1609574718,Buggy.
1609574680,"No NPC AI
No open world car chases
No open world braindances
Hardly any role-playing elements
Just bugs

Seriously though, reading the positive reviews here makes me think I played a different game, honestly.  If the sheer amount of bugs doesn't turn you away, then the shocking lack of features should.  The whole game plays like a hollow looter shooter with a very nice, if shallow, open world.  Avoid until the devs get their act together and put a little more game in their game."
1609574604,Buggy piece of shit but its fun if your hardware is good enough
1609574297,Can't make a bad review when your computer burst in flames.
1609574292,"I got to say, I really do enjoy this game. A few bugs here and there, but nothing game ending. 123 hours played and I can see 123 more hours being played."
1609574264,Not good enough.
1609574189,"I don't usually play RPG games, but decided to give Cyberpunk 2077 a try. Overall 10/10 game with some minor and somewhat frustrating glitches, however they are easy to forget when considering how fun this title is. I am currently on my second play through and attempted to go for a 100% play through, however I am blocked from doing so do to 1 mission bug and 1 iconic weapon crafting spec bug. Despite these 2 frustrations, I would still give this game a 10/10 and cannot wait for CD Projekt Red to expand on the game in both DLC and Multiplayer. I am confident that the negative flak that CD Projekt Red is receiving over this game is coming from console players, which I am certain cannot run this game properly due to my PC with a 3090 FE struggling to maintain 60 fps in some instances. I highly recommend Cyberpunk to anyone who has a decent PC."
1609573724,"Buggy, kinda bland combat. Story is great. visuals are amazing, and scope of the world is insane! I got my money's worth!

Also, 10/10 simping for Panam"
1609573549,"I was one of the lucky ones that didn't have many bugs and those I did encounter were very minor.  I enjoyed the story, although it was more linear than promised.  If I could do it over again, I would wait for a sale.  But regardless, I did enjoy the game.

I look forward to CDPR adding more content and polishing/fixing things like NPC AI and character stat bugs."
1609573505,"As you have heard: This game is NOT  The Witcher. Witcher was FUN - this game is set to fuck the player on all levels. I put in 50 hours on easy and the gameplay was hard and not engaging like CD Project Red in the past. 
Glitchy since it was forced to release before total completion. 

I'm really blown away NEGATIVELY by the police response - I can -through no fault of my own_ accidentally kill a pedestrian because some fucking douche NPC crased into me and the cops FUCKING KILL THE SHIT OUTTA ME - fuck that - fuck this game and its bullshit programming."
1609573385,My bugs were more funny than game breaking. I've waited for this game for a while and I've enjoyed it very much.
1609573137,"I would both recommend this and NOT recommend this simultaneously. Story, graphics gameplay all good. But it suffers from a lot of bugs. Unlike a lot of people, I didnt see them until after I finished the storyline, did all NCPD missions and bought all vehicles.
HOWEVER the game just now locks up, its unplayable. Its definitely the game itself, because some areas like the nomad areas the game runs fine. I'm running i9/2080 on medium so its not a performance issue. It seems like something crashing when I look at part of the city. And it only broke recently, so I am wondering if its because I have completed so much."
1609572859,"Yes, it has a lot of bugs but the story is amazing! I really recommend it if you want to have a good time"
1609572836,"So Cyberpunk 2077 is an interesting case. On one hand, it's a very well-constructed universe and the general atmosphere of the game is really good. Most characters and stories are also really well done, including Johnny Silverhand and Panam. On the other hand, the game itself is obviously unfinished, with bug and performance issues pretty much everywhere.

However, by the end of the game, I found myself really enjoying the game overall, flaws and all. Most of the bugs are more comical than problematic, and I was really drawn into the universe as a whole. I have no doubt CD Projekt Red will perfect the game eventually, but right now, it's essentially still in Early Access."
1609572763,"Damn bugs or no damn bugs, the damn game is damn good. I spent way too much damn time on this damn game. Damn."
1609572481,23 hours in and no complaints so far. Absolutely loving this game. The story and characters are incredible.
1609572270,"WINDOWS 10 ERROR CAN'T FIX, REFUND OR PATCH TRIED EVERYTHING.
"
1609572210,"It's still a buggy mess, but still a very enjoyable game. If you're happy to wait you probably should though. Wait til they clear out most/all of the bugs first, leave the rest of us fools to be unwitting beta testers."
1609572087,It is buggy but not game breaking.  Its been fun.
1609571987,"PROS:
Some excellent character-focused questlines;
Strong gameplay systems;
Night City itself is well crafted.

NEGATIVES:
Major technical and performance issues;
Main questline isn't particularly interesting;
Driving is terrible.
< 7 OUT 10 >"
1609571951,"this was not the game i was promised, way to much cut content for me to enjoy anymore play throughs"
1609571950,"Is good, is buggy, but is good."
1609571922,"yes
"
1609571813,i don't know why people complains bout this game. it's easily one of my favorites. the glithes that do happen for me are often hilarious and add for an even better and funnier experience. Is good game
1609571691,"Not as buggy on pc,its a good game it just needs a few patches and it will be a great game,alot of people have been whining over everything since launch,it will all be fixed so get over it"
1609571590,Great game still buggy but  enjoying. GREAT game from cd project red.
1609571587,"Panam Palmer, worth the price of admission just for her story. This game has bugs, but it bugs you to stop playing to. As you complete each mission you get drawn into the world, you start caring about the people. You get pissed off and want revenge.

This game is a Master piece for role-playing fans. While it isn't as responsive to changes as say fall out. the city feels alive as you drive through it. I find myself skipping using the way point system and driving place to place just to see the game more.

Right now this goes up there with my three favorite role-playing games. Its worth buying at full price. Which I rarely do. Honestly if your on the fence and going to wait until the bugs are worked out its not a bad idea. If you have a machine to run this and your locked down with little too do, this game scratches the itch....so forget the bugs."
1609571564,I  like it.
1609577825,"is okay

Edit: Learn to spell ""delivery"" CD Projekt Red."
1609571459,there are boobs
1609571434,"This game is horrendous. They literally lied about almost every aspect of this game. AI is crap. Ripper Docs are crap, click and buy - money gone, no cut scene, nothing. THEY LIED ABOUT EVERYTHING. This game is incredibly BORING. Cops do not chase you, enemy AI do not chase. This list is endless and I do not see how they can fix it. I would really like my money back."
1609571405,"This game is quite literally one of the biggest fucking lies I've ever experienced. Playing this was like watching someone finish a project in the last 20 min when they were given an entire week to do so. If you're looking for a next-gen open-world RPG experience, well then I'm sorry but you're going to have to keep looking. Most of this game's so-called 'glitches' are actually the result of lazy game designing. The AI for NPCs in this game were supposed to have daily routines and be sophisticated but instead, most of them are brain dead to the point where their interactions are so incredibly limited that they either just cower on the ground or outright disappear. The gun fights while you're driving in a car are scripted so that the enemies die only at a certain segment and most of the dialogue options in this game don't even make a goddamn difference in the story. Most of the side content comes in the form of mundane 'fetch' quests where you go collect something or kill someone with a bounty on their head and really destroys the replayability. You get to pick between 3 different life paths that really only affect where in the world you start the game and were probably included to make you think like there was some variety between them. I could go on and on about all these incredible features that were supposed to be implemented based off the promotional content but basically, this game is not worth the hype nor your money."
1609571297,its a fun game
1609571287,It's pretty good. Kinda buggy but the writing and acting is pretty good. Would have been better as a normal fps with a nonlinear story rather than an open-world RPG. Bugs are a drag but assuming they fix those up it's solidly above average and worth a play-through.
1609571246,beautiful
1609571204,GTA but futuristic.
1609571176,"First off the only reason I'm am giving this a NO right now is because there are some game breaking bugs. I mean some that would literally ruin your save file and cause you to almost lose 100's of hours of game play. Something like that to me is unexceptable, but luckily I escaped the full brunt of this bug by doing all the side gigs before doing the main story. 

Story wise the game is very good. The side gigs are meh as far as story goes outside a few notable ones that include the main friends you've made along the way. 

Gameplay is fun and fast, but the AI poses little to no threat at times. The AI is years behind compared to other games. The city seems so alive at first but as you peel the layers away you see that it's just filled with lifeless NPCs, as compared to the 1000+ unique NPCs we were told we would get with their own daily routines. You'll see the same NPC in several different spots, enemies don't seek cover, when hacking them they just stand there and yell ""Come out"" till you fry their brains.

With a little polish and major bug fixes I would change the review for this game in an instant. I love Night City it's deffinitely one of the best crafted cities I've seen in a video game and I love the cyberpunk genre, but so much stuff was missing from it and without mindless side quest you could probably breeze through this game in like 10 hours or less."
1609571126,"Haven't finished it yet but I think I've played for the perfect amount of time to leave a review. 69 hours in and I've loved every second. All I wanted from this game was another open world to get immersed in just like The Witcher 3, and CDPR delivered. The story, characters, and side quests are the highlights, with diverse and interesting game play options to keep things fresh. The world that has been crafted to house all this is also incredible. So is the music. And the cyberware. It's all cool. I really like this game. You should play it."
1609571045,futuristic pew pew skrt skrt
1609570987,Love the game but it has bugs
1609570963,.
1609570956,game have lot's of bug's and that's not even worst part of game because they release just skeleton of rpg and all hipe'd thing's from trailer was removed.
1609570911,"it breaks my fucking heart that i can't recommend this game.
this has been the most soul crushing betrayal from a company i've seen.
i wouldn't even be giving this a negative review if it wasn't so goddamn downgraded, and if they hadn't lied to us this hard.
take this, the 2018 gameplay reveal: https://youtu.be/vjF9GgrY9c0
and this fucking list of shit that was cut/changed: https://gyazo.com/26bb4dbe881d3d79688cd7993e3879f7 https://gyazo.com/1b48c873d82a8a22ef12d53eab057c12

at the end of the day, it's not a bad game in of itself, but the lag, bugs, lies, and downgrades make me give this a negative review.
at the very least, we get a good lesson out of this, if you're gonna delay, delay indefinitely."
1609570855,"GREAT GAME, still buggy but very engaging and solid storyline"
1609570838,"There are bugs, gameplay are not polished, but aesthetic, art, setting, world-building, story-telling, characters & personality are top notch and match the cyberpunk theme."
1609570821,"I like the game so far about 35 hours in. I've been doing a lot of side quests trying to attain cash and cyberware, but have done some main questing, too.  There's been some crashing, but not a ton of bugs after update 106. For a Beta release on PC, its pretty good and a fun game. Would've been cool if there were more   K Reaves video cut scenes included as a broken up psuedo movie vs just the virtual Keannu, but its fine as is."
1609570749,Amazing game and has a lot to offer but also has a short story line so to get the full experience of this game complete all the side story missions for much better endings
1609570683,"It's bad. Like... really bad. Like... really really bad.
I just managed to finish the first mission, going through the Nomad introduction into Night city and I just had to give up due to all of the optimisation issues. I want to like this game so bad but it's just impossible to do so in the current condition it lays in...

Also, couldn't request a refund because I forgot to close the crash report window and apparently it counts as play time so... yeah."
1609570639,"Game is actually epic. Don't listen to the hate, as long as ur PC can run it, then its a grand old time."
1609570635,"Great game, amazing story, fun game play, and only mildly annoying bugs."
1609570569,"I'm just an average gamer. 30 y.o. dude who works everyday and games casually. Does this have its bugs and problems? Absolutely. Am I sometimes confused by the content? Yup. But I can't help but enjoy this game. I can't stop playing it sometimes. I haven't really touched much of the story, but with the side gigs and fighting, I'm having a good time.

The driving could be fixed a bit, and I feel like sometimes the fights are a little easy (maybe I should bump up the difficulty), but overall I'm having fun and definitely feel like I got my monies worth. 

Can't wait to see the devs fix up the game a bit more in the coming months (or however long, but please be soon), but I don't regret buying this game at all."
1609570387,"Loved the game, i know it's a bit buggy now. But the game is amazing!"
1609570261,n/a
1609570198,pretty fun
1609570170,gud geym
1609569905,fun
1609569869,Great game but it was rushed
1609569740,Try playing it later
1609569722,"Despite the general distaste for the game being released early, it's still a really good game. Given another year or so for the devs to release patches and updates, I'm sure it will be miles closer to what it should've been."
1609569624,"Well, I have the played the game for like 40 hours or so. I have finished the game once. The game is good. It has a good story and it's fairly easy to play and understand. It's little buggy which can get distracting at times but in whole not too bad (It crashed on me twice during the whole play through and I had to restart the game 2 times again due to a bug and a bad buggy save. The bug was the arasaka rooftop bug in the first Silverhand mission which I think was fixed on a recent patch). Going Blind into the game I feel satisfied and enjoyed the experience. Hopefully the game will be patched up well for a more smoother experience (if you're playing it after this comment)"
1609569595,Great game even with the bugs and lack of optimisations. I love the story line and all the game mechanics. I highly recommend if your computer can run it.
1609569528,"Going into the game blind and coming in with no pre-judgement of the game, its amazing. It really is one of the best games of the decade. However, due to recent issues with the game experienced by people, i feel like this game still has a lot going for it even though it came with glitches. I believe with the patches this will solve most of the problems plaguing players around the globe. But this shouldn't take away from what it brings. Deep story, amazing graphics, beautiful visuals and art, and the chance to explore the vastness of Night City and its surrounding cities. I do hope that CDPR brings online capabilities which there are rumors going around in forums that this could be seen as soon as 2021. this would further make this game that much more enjoyable and fun to play with friends. Furthermore i do wish you could customize your characters physical appearance like eyes, hair, etc. Also this could also apply to the vehicles we purchase in the game. Like upgrading the body, power, color, aesthetics, etc. Though i feel this could be fixed or added down the line. Overall, CDPR did an amazing job with this game and i'm enjoying the game the more i play it. I hope with the patches in the coming months we can see further improvements to make this game that much more amazing."
1609569439,"GOTY imo 
some things that i don't enjoy so far:
bugs
you can't change your character's face/hair in mid game 
"
1609569417,"lots of bugs which are really intersting but a good game nonetheless
"
1609569391,"This game is good as long as it isn't crashing.

Just wait a few months. Like CDPR should have done."
1609569337,like
1609569307,"great story, buggy"
1609569297,You get to hang out with Keanu Reeves
1609569283,Fantastic and engaging. Very enjoyable now; after a few patches it'll be a masterpiece. Highly recommended.
1609569282,"This game has its ups and downs. I rarely experienced bugs that stopped progression. When I did it was a matter of quick saving and loading to continue on. I feel the bugs are not extensive enough to justify a negative review.

The story is great. The majority of the quality content is in the side quests and gigs. Thats where the writing shines. I am not a  fan of the character they tie you to; the role playing aspect is hurt as a result, but continuing down that path it opens up the character and they become actually quite good. At the very least understandable. Overall the main story is less important to the side missions. 

The game looks great. The enemy and crowd ai are not very good. Depending on how you have built your character the enemy ai will stand out significantly or very little. Its a fun game, with some economy balances and some tweaking to certain skill trees I think it will be significantly better. I think this will be the next skyrim mod wise, and I am looking forward to seeing what the modders will do with it in the future. 

Game is worth full price IMHO."
1609569263,"Nice model, fighting and tasks. Build a fantastic cyberpunk world. you will love it if you like Ghost in the Shell."
1609569254,Buggy but fun. Some of the glitches really catch you off guard/others just make you laugh. The over all game is extremely enjoyable and the learning curve isn't terrible. You'll be hacking/fighting/shooting and wrecking chooms in no time.
1609569198,"The game is super glitchy and doesn't really run well (this might be because of my old computer). The story is good I think but I wouldn't really know because of how hard it was to actually play the game. For the ""short"" time that I played the game, it was pretty meh. I am really looking forward to when CD Projekt Red fixes all the bugs. As of now I wouldn't recommend the game mostly because of the price. You are paying $60 for a game that hardly runs but is still kinda fun and for this reason I don't recommend it."
1609569176,"pretty fun, a little buggy."
1609569148,!!!!!
1609569062,An outstanding genre defining game for PC gamers.
1609569015,just needs some polish and a couple more updates and its good to go
1609569002,worth the wait

1609568965,If you can get past some of the bugs it is truly an amazing game.
1609568964,amazing game
1609568893,This game has bugs but the story is legendary.
1609568847,"It's alright, and I hope it keeps getting better. Wasn't the game we expected, but it's still decent."
1609568836,Very much like this game.
1609568705,"The more I play, I see different specs I want to play. I'm enjoying this more than I even really know. We're all on PC here and if you have a more decent pc, it's great!"
1609568681,Awesome game on pc hardly any bugs
1609568658,"Regardless of circumstances, game's very good. And definitely grows on you the more you play it"
1609568645,"Game needed more delays but was released either way. So bugs were to be expected. Despite all the glitches and bugs, the game is aesthetically satisfying, great storyline!"
1609575564,"While it took me almost 75 hours to beat the game I feel like I can say my piece about Cyberpunk 2077. This is also my first REAL review and II chose this game to be the most deserving. When it comes to single player story-rich rpgs I am always invested. Games like Witcher and KOTOR are some of the most legendary stories of all time, and I believe Cyberpunk 2077 can walk with the greats. From the moment I launched the game for the first time I was completely blown away and under the spell this game casted on me. This review won’t be a full gameplay rundown as people have done so many of those. I will also refrain from any potential spoilers as if it’s your first time playing you should go in blind 100%.

[b]Story and Characters[b]
I cried lol. The main story was outstanding. When you truly understand the beauty and depth this game holds it’s easy to become attached to it. Every side quest is deeply crafted and very well written with amazing characters to go with it. There wasn’t a moment where I disliked any Main or Major Side Character in the game because they all were so complex in each of their own ways. 

I want to give a shout out to Gavin Drea who voiced male V which is the gender I went with. He delivered every line beautifully as if he was V. His voice fit the character and along with Keanu Reeves it was a voice duo that I don’t think can be easily topped in the near future by any performance. The constant back and forth between the two whether it was an argument or just shooting the s**t. That goes for almost every character in the game, all of the voice acting was special and I have 0 complaints about any of it.


[b]Night City[b]
The setting in CP2077 is a living and breathing city that feels like it’s own character. Your relationship with it can easily change as time goes on. I can easily say I feel the same way about Night City’s map as I do Los Santos in GTAV, and we all know that city better than our own. I recognize streets and neighborhoods and know where to go without using the map and waypoints, well aside from missions that is.
  
The world is extremely interactive and crawling with a mountain of unique personalities. I found myself so immersed in Night City that I almost never fast traveled and chose to walk when missions were under 1KM. You don’t just spawn in the game a legend, you earn it through recognition and people learn your name when you take on more and more jobs


[b]Performance[b]
The game surprisingly ran extremely well on my PC but given as I have an RTX 2070 Super it better have run well or I’d flip my shit. I had 110FPS highs but in densely populated areas in the city it could hit 55fps minimums. I ran this game on High and some Ultra settings. I averaged about 70-90FPS constantly more on the 85ish area. 


[b]Dislikes and Bugs[b]
The wanted system is still completely broken and had so much potential to be great. Cops don’t magically manifest right in front of you when you punch an old lady. They glitch into buildings  and don’t offer up much of a chase either. It would be insane to get into a car chase with police because honestly the driving is pretty damn good. I thought it would be way worse based on how people were bashing it but it’s nowhere near bad. To be able to lose the cops and or shoot out of the car while driving would be nice. The trailer was a little misleading about that aspect of play, but then again it was a cinematic trailer not gameplay. 

As for bugs alone 97% of the time it was a minor inconvenience, I only ran into one serious bug which prevented me from completing a side quest *Small man Big Mouth* <spoiler tag it. When I say minor inconveniences there were quite a bit of them...quest objects being stuck to peoples hands, strange animations at times, voices overlapping from phone calls into current in person conversations, clipping and stuff like that. I never experienced any of the ridiculous bugs you see on YouTube aside from a car spawning in the sky and crushing some poor bastard. The little bugs never bothered me because Cyberpunk reminds me of a Cyberpunk dystopia themed Skyrim in terms of the bugs in an amazing game.

As for the genitals and I know this is a strange nitpick but just remove it man, it offers literally 0 to the story, genital customization isn’t relevant at all it's redundant. It’s not present during sex scenes except for one scene I can remember. It is better off not there to be honest.

                     !!!!!DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T BEAT THE MAIN STORY!!!!!

[spoiler]After story gameplay simply doesn’t exist because of the way the game ends. You can only reload the last world save which is fine but it doesn’t give me any satisfaction that V makes it in the big leagues like he wanted with his life intact. In fact it torments my soul every day because I don’t think the game offers an ending everyone is happy and content with. Not to say the endings are poorly written because they are far from it.[/spoiler]


[b]Conclusion[b]
Cyberpunk 2077 is by far one of the best stories I had the pleasure of experiencing and I am excited to see what the future holds for this title. I enjoyed almost every aspect of this game and it was worth all of the hype even though it was rushed to release and you can tell some corners were cut. With the game being released and every few days it is being fine tuned I am sure the title will stand hand and hand with The Witcher 3 on being one of the greatest RPGs of all time. It will easily go down in history truly as a game worth remembering."
1609568609,"I took 60 hours to finish this game and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Forget the BS review bombs, they're a function of the industry and the hype-train. Yes, the game has bugs, more than some, less than most. None broke the game for me and were nothing more than a minor irritation. The story was awesome, the characters solid, the progression was well laid out, and the environment was the mind-baby of Blade Runner and Akira - it was beautiful. I think people jump on the hype-train and expect a game (or movie, or book) to deliver more than is possible - the hype-train has no brakes. This is why so many AAA, highly advertised titles, get review bombed into oblivion where lesser known indie games become over night successes. It's about expectation, when you have unrealistic expectations, you will be disappointed. Manage your expectations and you may actually enjoy things. Take the game at face value and you'll love it. It sure did!"
1609568602,"As of Jan 1st 2021
Played fine with my 1080TI and comparable hardware. Still, expect a lot of bugs. If you run into a problem, save the game and reload it. If that doesn't work, exit out of the game to desktop and start it up again. That solved pretty much every problem I had.

7/10 (would be 9/10 if not for bugs and bad law enforcement mechanics)
The story is just amazing, as expected of CDPR.
I have no real complaints about the gameplay other than the occasional bugging out. Which is a good thing imo, so high marks there.
The game is beautiful if you can power it. CDPR did drop the balls on graphics of tiny objects though.
I'm taking an entire point for the law enforcement mechanics of the game. Any time your committing a crime (or something that should be a crime) for a quest, the game just ignores it. Any time you commit what the game considers a crime the police magically know about it and spawn in 5 ft behind you.
I'm taking another whole point off because of how buggy the game is. I came in expecting a lot of bugs because CDPR had to make most of the core game mechanics and technology from scratch. You have to remember CDPR made The Witcher, not GTA5 so this is their first time making a game with cars and guns. With that in mind I think they did a great job with game.

1609568591,"Oh god the trees, they float, AND THEY'RE EVERY WHERE! Also the game is meh."
1609568548,One of the best games to ever come out!  I will be replaying this one multiple times :D
1609568493,"Why all the hate about this game?   

I'm plenty aware there are bugs.  One of the few games I still have in my steam library is Skyrim with the community bug patch from nexus mods....   give it time this game is gonna be dope I promise.  

My graphics card isn't meant to play games like this, but it is used for rendering 3d objects in real time.  So in that regard I have gta 4 graphics when the top end rendering its like playing borderlands style graphics :)

This game is so rich,  cops pull over random people.   there gang and turf wars.  Fuck the missions, i'm getting lost exploring the maze that is the various ghettos.  within night city.  Its a beautifuly rendered and lushed 3d landscape.  

If there is ever a game I wanted to get a brand new rig for it'd be this.  
Don't listen to the haters. this game is amazing.  

Before seeing the ripper doc i just went left and decided to walk down the street and explore the town.  I've met people that have like my style.  People that have told me to fuck off.  I've been killed by the cops quite a few times pretending to be a ninja on random people... Ive helped the cops take down random street thugs in encounters that pop up.  its so much fun to not do the main quest and just slowly level u.

1609568442,"Keanu Reeves is a terrorist, not much more I need to say"
1609568442,its alright
1609568366,This game is so much fun! you deffenatly have to pay attention to a lot of things
1609568319,"Не буду рекомендовать к прохождению сейчас.
Причина - не куча выпиленных механик и завышеные ожидания. В этом вина не разработчиков, а маркетологов.
Настоящая причина скорее огромное количество багов. И вот тут вина именно разрабов на 100%. Если бы я сбрасывал таймер каждый раз, когда встречаю неприятный баг - рекорд наверное был бы минут 15 в пустошах и минут 5 в городе. Это что касается не серьезных багов. Те же, что мешают прохождению миссий я встречал довольно часто, начиная с застрявшего на одном месте Джекки в башне Арасаки и заканчивая банальным отсутствием возможности пройти миссию с киберпсихом, потому что пригер диалога не появляется. Можно ещё вспомнить про иногда пропадающий звук в диалогах и спавн автомобилей в метре от тебя, но это мелочи. Ещё часто встречается падение со смертельной двухметровой высоты: почему-то персонаж любит иногда соскальзывать с предметов с ускорением явно не свойственным нашей планете)
Ну и конечно досадные недоработки в виде отсутствия механики погони и появление копов и воздуха вокруг тебя, а так же отсутствие автолевелинга врагов. Последнее конечно на любителя, но как и в ведьмаке получается достигнуть последнего уровня и улучшить всё, что улучшается до того как пройдешь и половину активностей на карте, а вот уровень навыков - например те же клинки или короткоствол так до конца и не докачиваешь, потому что не на ком.
Итог - остаётся ждать DLC и надеяться, что фиксики всё пофиксят."
1609568292,The glitches and bugs are hilariously funny.
1609568223,"Having completed the game in a few different scenarios, after 96 hours of gameplay. I have to say it wowed me. This is more than likely one of the best games of the year in several categories. 

I’m a game developer myself and many things just capture my eye. These days I can see many games coming out with no regard of the consumers hard drive space for example. This game was well optimized for the amount of content it had. The graphics where just spot on. You could easily emerge yourself into the game without any artifact popping out. 

The animations where spot on. You could really feel the characters emotions through every animation and facial expression.

While playing the game, there were many options on the story. It felt like 4 good movies into one. It felt like a gift that kept on giving.

The attention to detail was just out of this world. I did all the side missions in the world, and most of the felt unique.

All the vehicles were just fun to drive. I loved the radio, and it reminded me of the good old GTA III.
The game truly felt like a culture and nostalgic fest of movies, game and books. You could turn around every corner of the game, and you would find nostalgic references that would tickle you the right way.

There were many ways to level your character thought the game. I think at this point we’re used to RPGs being a grind to the max level. In this game it was the opposite. The game was really on the entire time until max level. It felt fun and refreshing, until the max level.

Sure, there were issues in the game, but I have to keep this section short. To be perfectly honest none of the shortcoming of the game were a problem for me. If there was a bug, it didn’t hinder me from continuing the game, or really bother me.

Going back towards summarizing the review. It’s hard to describe the game. It was a great mix of many games. Deus ex, Metal Gear Solid and GTA come to mind. However, it was unique in its own way, and easily captured me. 

Instead of setting a number out of 10 on the game, I’m going to try a different approach. From the day the game was released it took me 9 days to have spend 96 hours within the game to finish the game, do all the side mission and complete most of the achievements I wanted. This is even though I worked a 40-hour work week. That’s most of the 2 weekends I had and most of the hours after work I could muster together.

Therefor [b]I take off my hat to all the developers that worked on the game, say bravo,[/b] and recommend people to buy and play the game.
"
1609568193,Glitches aren't that bad. I have only seen three and one of them was just a simple rendering issue. 10/10 game.
1609568160,Like the witcher but if the witcher were a bladerunner
1609568151,"Its has bugs no doubt, but the story is goddamn amazing. Its a must play."
1609568086,good game good story
1609568050,"Nice
"
1609568678,"[i]DISCLAIMER: This is a game that's best served going into it without any spoilers so proceed with reviews with a little caution. For me, I had no idea about any of it beyond its setting and that Keanu was in it (but I had no idea of his role). Thus, the ""big reveal"" during the opening heist had me instantly hooked because it was such a fascinating concept. As such, I want to break down what I liked and I didn't with as little spoilers as possible.[/i]

In short, I loved this game. Its story, Night City, and the nihilism contained within its streets are ugly beautiful. Without bugs, it would be a solid 8.5/10. With its bugs it's a 8/10 for anyone with a good rig (and likely 6 or 7 for those without). That said, I hope history is kind to this game because what it's saying is poignant as well as well-written, the concept of engrams and what it means to be alive is fascinating, and the characters of Silverhand and V are interesting juxtapositions. It has flaws, it has bugs, but it's one of the better open world games in the past decade--especially if you like world building, if you like good characters.

One caveat: play the game thoroughly. Don't rush to the end, or save side quests until after the end. You can beat it fairly quick, but it won't have much meaning if you do. Much of the meaning of the game are in the side quests and even side gigs. Yeah, sure the side gigs can be a bit cut and paste (a lot of them are simply variations on fetch or escort quests), but it's so cool seeing inside these buildings and really getting to know Night City as well as its denizens.  Plus it's interesting to some degree the variation of characters; some people you save are wretched, some are opportunistic, some are tiring. Even the Cyber Psychosis quests take a long time, but their stories are sympathetic and it's interesting (I still remember the reality TV sister one). You'll feel like you really tried to make it in Night City, you'll feel like the city really chewed you up and spit you out, and you'll feel a lot more emotion during the various ending paths of the game.

[h1]The Good[/h1]
[*] [b]Writing[/b]: This is mature, this is gritty, this is fantastic. This isn't a happy ending feel good game, even when you try to soften the blows you end up pretty destroyed. The most fascinating part to me are truly the characters of Night City--everyone from a couple of politicians trying to actually do good in the city to a vending machine named Brendan has a lot of personality. Some are evil, some are good, some are just trying to exist. It's some of the best writing in any medium in the past decade.
[*] [b]Setting and Ambiance[/b] Night City is ugly beautiful, and it eats people whole. It is perfect. Side note: they also REALLY nailed languages. Like, the creole alone was amazing, let alone how one of the gangs speaks Cantonese. 
[*] [b]Graphics[/b]: Gorgeous game. The city is beautifully sculpted and its districts all have such a style that plays into state of the art graphics for a great result. I played with a top-end rig, I assume it is a nightmare right now with a worse card due to bad optimization.
[*] [b]Combat[/b]...at first. At first combat is great, but it gets repetitive; it starts out being really fun to play stealth, but it gets boring as you end the game. I would say hacking and stealth is the most fun and easily provides dozens of hours of ""joy"" until you've simply played too much.
[*][b]Braindances[/b] are a little underutilized, but I loved River Ward's questline's use of them. I also liked scanning things. It was fun to play detective.
[*][b]Johnny Silverhand[/b] is amazing. He really grows on you, sort of like a really sardonic and nihilistic fungus.
[/list]

[h1]The Bad[/h1]

It's important to note that while the bad list is long, they're actually so minor compared to the benefits. Basically what it offers is stronger than the weaknesses. I just want to be thorough about how it's far from perfect.

[list]
    [*] [b]Combat[/b] gets pretty stale as I said. I have played every build. Melee is very bad.  Additionally I played on the second hardest difficulty and it's not balanced. I was able to snipe or revolver kill anyone without a thought. When I amped it up to the hardest one, I noticed almost no difference (same one shot on their end or one shot on mine). As such, the skill tree is meaningless after a bit.
[*] [b]Items[/b]. I literally used the same gun for 50 hours of the game without even needing to craft/upgrade it. I used the same pants since level 5 because they had a 15% crit modifier. Even when I got more armor items, that 15% crit legendary made them best in slot... oh, god, they were hideous pants, and to get something better I'd have to pay about $100k for a mod. However, I was killing everything with them and I had cars to buy. So I didn't bother.
[*] [b]Bugs[/b]. I mean yeah it's very buggy. I had almost no bugs for like 40 hours. I thought it was great. And then it happened: game destroying bugs. The last half of the game though was SO buggy. Pretty much everything after the parade scene (including side quests) bugged pretty bad for me. I even had a bug where I couldn't shoot my weapon anymore and I had to go back through saves until I found one 2 hours earlier that worked. SAVE A LOT and don't overwrite your saves too much.
[*][b]It's not a RPG like it was billed as[/b]. This is not a true RPG. Just in this year alone, Wasteland 3 had way more choices and variations. When you move away from caring about that, you can mostly just look at the story they're telling and appreciate it immensely--but it's very much a visual novel with an action game tied to it, not a true RPG. For example, I played out a side quest which determines who runs a sex club, and all the choices sucked and had zero real impact. A character you just met dies in one option and a woman you like is upset (but not upset enough to not date you) in the other. You can ally with a gang and their members really do still attack you even though it implies they won't (at least mine did, could be a bug, who knows with this game). Morally, the choices are dynamic and confusing and 'fun', it's just they don't do anything to the world really because Night City is what it is. Whereas in other true RPGs, little things mean more and add up to big things.
[/list]


[h1]The Ugly[/h1]

[list]
    [*] [b]The police[/b]. Seriously one of the worst wanted systems in any game ever. I would literally turn a corner, a NPC would slowly spawn in or walk into me, not even die, and the cops would chase me."
1609567671,Fun game. maybe im just lucky but I have not experienced anywhere near the amount of bugs other have. The few I have experienced have all been visual and typically resolved with a quick save and load
1609567666,"This game has many problems mainly glitches. But other than that it is a very fun game that i have put many hours into, and not to mention the story had my interest peaked the entire time. Finally there are many side quests that have their own story's that can last hours, if you take your time i believe you will be able to fall in love with the lore and many of the characters."
1609567659,trash
1609567627,"Other than initial launch bugs and performance issues, now the game has been working great.  Very dense world with lots of details.  Lots of side quests and general things to do.  Has a great story line as well.  Combat features lots of weapons and you have lots of mods and cyber implants.  Lots of ways to handle a confrontation.  Hacking, gun play, stealth all pretty well implemented."
1609567548,"Current state for $60 dont buy it. Too many bugs, visual glitches, and crashes. I knew there would be issues going on, but expected other elements to be more polished.

Story is okay, but like with Star Wars 9 and Game of Thrones a bad ending will ruin everything else. to be fair there may be alternate endings but the ending i picked after playing he character felt poor and not what the character would do. 

Side quests got repetitive and boring real quick not enough diversity at all or main character interaction. A lt of random interactions or go buy a car. 

Gun play is horrible. Enemies feel like tanks unless head-shotting with a crit and even then my best weapon was a sword and i did not build stealth at all. 

Hacking and the cyber usage is also really bad. This is what i built my character to do and it was a waste as i ended up running around with a sword because it was easier"
1609567514,"Good game. It's not the greatest game like people hyped it up to be, but don't let the the hate it gets just because it is popular distract you from the fact that it is still an amazing game."
1609567495,Maybe the real Keanu Reeves was the cyber virus we contracted along the way.
1609567484,"i enjoy playing this game at them moment, very buggy however. Good story line, open world freedom, possible dystopian future. i think they wrecked the game when they took out alot of content."
1609567438,"Very buggy game and outside of the main story there isn't a lot of detail
Overall I enjoyed the game though.
7/10"
1609567384,Portrayal of identity and agency is spot on.
1609567343,The details in this game are so well thought out and really adds to it overall. Loving the theme and style of this game as well!
1609567338,"Love the game don't get discouraged Cyberpunk devs, just work through the bugs and patch it up. Great job!!"
1609567282,"This game is an absolute buggy, broken mess. Random deaths, UI elements disappearing (or appearing when unwanted), abilities or basic keybinds not working without a reload, the only reason I've put this much time in this is 8 years of waiting combined with the sunk cost fallacy.

Beyond that, even if you remove the horrible mess from the game, the actual writing, quests, and overall working parts of the game are par at best. They're underwhelming in the long run and I'm honestly not even sure CDPR's normal practice of putting an additional 6 to 18 months of development into the game and releasing an enhanced edition will save this garbage fire."
1609567282,"The story is one of the best, but buggy as hell. still fun tho"
1609567223,This is hands down the best game you will play in 2021! The story is amazing and truly keeps you captivated without making you feel bored. The side quests are amazing and have great stories on their own. Highly recommend this game to anyone looking for the next big adventure!
1609567165,Yep some bugs but awesome none the less
1609567076,"For whatever issues plague this game on consoles, last gen especially, I wasn't in the least bit let down by my own experience on PC. If you have a decent rig and value story, world building, immersion, and a truly meaningful gaming experience compared to the dredge of mediocrity the gaming industry defecates out every year, don't listen to the herd and buy this game. 

Positives
- Dialogue: I can't think of a single game I've played in my lifetime that has better, more naturally constructed dialogue pertaining mainly to it's core story (but several later side missions are also masterfully written). At no point in over 100 hours did I ever feel the desire to skip dialogue, because virtually all of it was engaging and well done. And kudos to the voice acting in this game doing it's part make this work so well. 
- Branching Decisions: While the game is more linear than I thought it was going to be initially, it does do a great job of making you feel like your choices in dialogue matter. Especially when interacting with Johnny. I played a true-blue Corpo who was constantly combative with Johnny throughout the game and that dramatically changed the tone and options I had at the end (compared to alternate outcomes I've seen online). 
- Music: For as good as everything in Night City looks, it sounds even better. This has to be the greatest OST ever made for a game (sorry Doom). I am usually not a adrenaline junky sort of player, but sometimes I just decided to screw trying to be stealthy and go in Mantis Blades swinging, mainly because the accompanying music makes you feel like an absolute unstoppable, Rambo-esque force of nature. 
- Story: Been a long time since a story in a video game made me care. The last time was probably Hellblade. The last RPG to accomplish that... probably Inquisition. But I was fully invested in the overarching story of this game, the prominent side characters you meet along the way, and the connection you build to your own V. And unlike many ambitious massive stories like this (looking at you ME3), this game manages to come to a satisfying resolution, regardless of what choices you made. I ended up with I guess you would call the ""bad ending"" compared to the others, but still felt satisfied that it was a logical conclusion for the V I was playing. 
- Varied Play Styles: There's a lot of ways to play this game and the system is flexible enough to allow you to take it any direction you want. I went for a jack-of-all-trades type in the end who had a mixture of quickhacking, blades, and stealth and found it pretty enjoyable. The gameplay isn't anything groundbreaking, but for a story focused game it worked perfectly fine for me. 

Negatives
- Lacking Open World AI: As many others have mentioned, the NCPD AI is just really annoying and doesn't work. Without any sort of chase mechanic (outside of scripted events) the driving in the game feels very underutilized. It's really only good for sight seeing or listening to the radio. Further, pedestrian AI is pretty dumb too. Can't tell you how many times a pedestrian jumped IN FRONT of my car instead of away from it as I was trying to avoid them. Lots of people in Night City have death wishes. 
- Too Many Generic Gigs: From about the midway point of the game onward, the majority of the side missions/gigs become more story focused and interesting. But the first half of the game, especially the prologue, is just chock full of generic gigs that boil down to kill this guy, steal this thing, corrupt this network. If you're a completionist like it me, it can get repetitive. 
- Random Nitpicks: You can't change your hair or other apperance options once you get out of the character creator, so you better make sure your happy with your choices initially or you'll have to resort to mods. Four wheeled vehicles are very hard to control at times and feel like driving on ice. Bikes felt much better to me though and that's mainly what I used. Romance options are more limited than I thought they would be. It's basically one straight and gay option for both sexes. Meaning if you are a straight male and have no interest in playing a female character you have one option. Now, all of those options I feel are pretty excellently done mind you, but still it would've been nice to see 1 bi male and female option to go along with those 4 so every V has at least 2 options of any one orientation. 

Verdict: 9.5/10"
1609567060,yes
1609566968,great world
1609566957,"I first off want to thank everyone who worked on & helped work on this game. It's beautiful, creative, and you can feel every ounce of creativity put into it. 
I see people around me, in my friendship groups, & people online saying such unnecessary things about this game. Sure there are bugs, sure there are things that could be improved. But that's how all games are. I loved every second of the Street Kid campaign & I really hope people give it a chance.
Well done to CDPR for making a stunning game. I loved it."
1609566926,"Elephant in the room - this game is buggy. There are issues that range from the immersion-breaking to stuff that has more of an impact on gameplay.

That said, this is some of the most varied quest design I've seen in an open-world game and it's one that really gives you a lot of different ways of play. Run-and-gun is just as valid of a strategy as slow and careful stealth, provided you follow a decent build for your aims."
1609566854,keanu wispers sweet nothings into my ear im happy
1609566761,Finish developing the damn game
1609566739,"While I did not follow the game in any way to avoid spoilers, I did hope to encounter an immersive sim, once it would finally get out. This I did not get. But then, I actually *expected* a captivating story, excellent world building and believable characters and we got all of those things, none of which is disappointing even in the slightest. While many (if not most) of the POIs on the map are not much more, than an excuse to spend more time in the game, the side and main quests are just soooo good, surpassing those of the Witcher III and my personal expectations. I could give you a 1000 little things, that range between 'feels generic' and 'this sucks', but if what you want, is to get lost in a cyberpunk world for a deep, story driven experience, like me, know that those little things simply don't matter enough to concern your self with them. Get the game for it's core values and enjoy them.

That being said, I was lucky and therefore quite shocked, when I've seen the bugs, some people encountered on their rigs. I had minor issues, which where rare and none of which where game braking, but the fact that others could not finish quests or what PS4 users had to put up with speaks volumes about how CDPRs values must have changed and that's why Cyberpunk was the last game I pre-ordered from those folks. 

Still, I recommend this game to fans of cyberpunk, story driven experiences and general immersion (athmosphear, character development, world building, etc) while to the average COD player I recommend to suck on the barrel of a BFG while pulling the trigger with their toes - but that is the only recommendation I have for these folks, so... 

happy new year =)"
1609566709,"Great game, lots of cool stuff. Bugs were minimal for me, just visual glitches."
1609566597,"After a considerable amount of hours put into this game... 34Hours as of right now.
I would definitely recommend this game. Yes on release and even now the game has had some minor bugs, even some major game breaking bugs which stopped the story from progressing. At least until you reload your last save and continue, having said that I only had this problem on the first few days of release.

Despite the bugs we all have probably heard about hundreds of times by now. The game itself is fantastic. Story, plot, Characters you meet along your adventures are all beautifully built, from crafting weapons, to upgrading body parts at ""Ripperdocs"" is all just great...grinding ""Gigs"" (Jobs) for more ""scrap"" (Currency, money) feels worth it just to get that extra piece of cyberware.

The Skill tree is very in depth but not overly complicated and makes levelling feel rewarding and worth the grind.

If you are a fan of RPG's and FPS games this should be a perfect choice for you....Just do some research on what the game actually offers as I think thats why a lot of players got upset with the developers (Excluding all the bugs) because they thought the game was completely different to what it is...This game has ridden the hype train and has spoilt its name from people not doing any research."
1609566452,"Besides the occasional bugs (which are certainly present, but hopefully will be fixed over time), this game is great in combining FPS, RPG, and Open-World elements in a futuristic game which looks amazing, especially at night. I play with settings on high with no ray-tracing, and I base my review off of that."
1609566388,great game
1609566357,"aside from some minor bugs, it is a good game wiht  great story"
1609566343,"All the hate on this game would lead you to believe this game has game breaking bugs that ruin everything and we should just break our computers and bow down to our console overlords who have demanded refunds!! 

OH wait, we built computers for a reason...so we could run great games like this.

Are there stupid bugs? Yes. Do you remember being sent to space in skyrim like Neil Armstrong? I do. This is no different. Goofy stuff will happen and then you will move on to smacking some cybernetic monstrosity across the street with your gorilla arms

Overall, CD Projekt Red brought a city to life in an era where fewer and fewer fun games are being released. Thank you for putting this together. I finally have a new world to explore.

The story is engaging and unique

The landscape is unique and has a cool futiristic feel.

The larger sidequests are fun! The smaller sidequests can get repetitive but are only necessary if you feel like you want to do something more and get cool gear. Its mainly a series of shootouts or rescues that make you fell like neo from the matrix...some like it some don't.

There is a variety of gear/loot/cars/characters that make the world feel alive. 

Overall, I recommend this game and you will get your moneys worth. Its unique, fun and a nice change of pace. You won't regret picking it up."
1609566251,"Buggy af but amazing story and characters, give it a few months and itll be one of the best games weve seen in awhile"

1609566180,THE SIMS 2077
1609566104,not a perfect game but very fun to play with a good story and some decent side quests.
1609566074,The rumors of this game's demise due to bugs have been greatly exaggerated.
1609565934,"Forget the news - this is a GREAT game, play anyway you want - worth the money. It's got the GTA feel that I think makes it addicting but has it's own great unique twist on everything!"
1609565910,It does have bugs and glitches but to me the game is super fun and really easy to enjoy I am very infested in the story I don't mind the lag and don't mind being on a low quality setting it will not stop me from enjoying this game
1609565874,good
1609565870,"No
"
1609565812,I am a nomad now. Only for Panam. Fuck everyone else.

1609565702,great
1609565694,It's great
1609565627,"I love the theme and the story of the game so far, It's not perfect yet, but with time and less complaining from it's fan base, I can see this being a great game.
The bugs will be patched if you give it time. If you play on a system that can handle the heavy lifting, you'll see far fewer bugs. I've got 90+hrs in an going. No complains here."
1609565584,"Despite the negative press, this game doesn't have any more bugs than any open world game. If you like the setting or CDPR, it's worth checking out"
1609565426,"good game with bugs, hard to explain. I wanted to love it but felt that it is less involved and less determined by choice than i thought it would be. I believe the company will fix the game, but it isn't what I expected. The game was fun and continues to be fun, but there are some bugs that can potentially ruin this game for it's players. So the story is amazing, and the side missions have some draw into other stories. The game feels fun, and no matter your decision in style of combat, it is satisfying. But in it's core the game play when playing on anything but the medium tier requirements in garbage due to the bugs. not the visual bugs, but the bugs that plague the stories and side missions, when you have to restart from a load out from like 20 min. ago, just to get past a point in dialogue and the missions that don't pick up on the distance between objectives. 


SO this is why I give it a thumbs up. All though there is a lot to hate about this game, there is a lot of good. The world feels good. the missions are solid and there is plenty of lore surrounding the missions. There is always something new and satisfying in every mission. Everything you need to do to 100% this game is fun. And I know the company will fix it. But in my opinion wait 6 months for them to fix the issues then buy the game. 

It's fun but not worth 60 dollars right now"
1609565407,"Don't listen to the bad reviews, it's a fun game and the bugs make it hilarious at times. I'm sure they will patch the issues but it's playable and the story in the game is pretty decent! Have been playing a lot of the side missions just to get a good feel of the whole city. Can see myself putting 100 hrs into this game."

1609565178,"works great on my acer nitro 5  with ram upgrade only. i see the bugs ever so often but it does not ruin the game at all at least for me. i havent played it on console but ive heard its not great lol. give em some time to figure it out guys, not every game was perfect when it first came out."
1609565161,Fun and great graphics
1609565112,"This is one of the best stealth games that I had ever played. I am very surprised that they did not advertise any stealthy game play like they did with the running and gunning game play. Trust me, if you are a stealth player you need to buy this game. 90% of the game can be done stealthy, and only 10% or less the game forces you to play it running and gunning. This is not like what the advertisement shows. When I saw the advertisements for this game I did not even think for a second that I will spend a single minute playing stealthy. Playing stealthy is almost the only activity I do in this game, simply stealth enemy camps all over the map.

The running and gunning is boring in my opinion. Every time I am forced to play running and gunning I get bored quickly and can't wait to finish the running and gunning mission so that I can go back to stealth again. But the running and gunning mechanics is very sweet. Whenever a game offers me the ability to run and gun or play stealthy, I always prefer the stealthy approach. I do the same thing in Dishonored 2. Dishonored 2 has great running and gunning mechanics, but I always play stealthy and I get bored quickly when I run and gun in that game.

Overall, CyberPunk 2077 is a great game. I definitely recommend it for both stealthy players and for those who like to run and gun."
1609565074,so much fun

1609564823,my arms got stuck forwards and it was the funniest shit I've ever seen
1609564822,yo this game is pretty good with story and graphics etc obv some graphic issues other than that super fun
1609564788,"TLDR; It's a fantastic game with good potential from future development.

As it is, It ran fantastic for me. A few small bugs here and there. Some hilarious. I'm on a 6 year old i7, sorely in need of upgrading with faster memory. I'm running it on an m2 drive. I have an RTX 2080.

Pros: 
-Performance was fantastic. Load times were ALMOST non-existent. I can get into the game in less than a minute.
-Visually Stunning
-Great story, some parts I truly felt
-Interesting gameplay
-Swords are awesome
-Map is big and wide open

Cons:
-The story could feel jumbled at times. The side quests would make the main quest's ""character development"" seem out of sync.
-Quick save often, some of those rare bugs could be solved just by loading that save.
-The cars didn't really feel different from each other. A few obvious differences, but a car worth 120K seemed no better than a 20K one.
-I'm around level 20 and finishing the game, but barely anything is unlocked in my character perks and such. I don't feel this is scaled well.

I'm hesitating to finish the last mission, but I'm honestly going to play it again with a different character."
1609564937,"I just wish the game didn't ruin my immersion due to all the glitches occuring between missions. The fps was another problem that should have been better considering I have a 2080ti and an i7 9700k processor. Buy this game at a later date when the bugs are tweaked and it runs much better. I really thought this game was the best one I ever played, but RDR2 stands at the top for me. 7/10 until patches come in."
1609564718,"A good game plagued by innumerable bugs due to the SNAFU of a launch. Still, when it works, it [i]works[/i]. Night City is gorgeous, a living, breathing place, and it's easy to lose yourself in it for hours at a time.

Still... maybe wait out a few more patches with some of those games abandoned in your Steam Library, huh? Don't forget to come back and check it out, but let it simmer just a little longer."
1609564622,It's alright
1609564593,yes
1609564564,Don't Listen to all the people talking about this game being unplayable  i have over 100 hours in the game and i have only noticed some floating items that's about it i'm only 15% into the game its well worth it and will only get better with time and updates.
1609564530,many bug but ye
1609564529,"the glitches do happen, but as long as you play the game legit they dont happen too much, love the game but seriously yall wanted it early and they gave it to us early, so we should stop complaining cause the odds are you either just dont like the game or also pushed for early release so duh of course theres bugs, personally  i love every moment of it the city is beautiful and detailed but not so much that you cant feel the weight your choices have."
1609564443,great game! does not get the credit deserved. hated the game for all of its hype but since its came out only fell in love more and more each day i played it. 10/10 would reccomend
1609564430,"Despite all the bugs, I still really enjoyed the game. It may not have been the ground breaking game changer that was being hyped by the web, but then again when is it ever?
"
1609564391,awesome game
1609564410,"The game is fun enough but they put in maybe a fourth of the features they claimed in their massive advertising campaign. 

The story and quests are good but no where near Witcher level.

The AI is absolutely awful. Worse than games that game out 10 years ago. 

Graphics are nice.

Your choices basically DO NOT matter. Its an action/adventure game, not an RPG with branching storylines like they claimed.

Overall I think the game is fun, but I don't encourage anyone to support a developer that used such shady practices and released a game that may as well be early access."
1609564289,"its a ok game middle of the pack, so far it does nothing that other games have not done better. I think GTA 6 and Red Dead Redemption 2 have both done better. Which is sad given they are older games and the devs should of learned and worked off those. RDR2 appeared better on my Xbox then Cyberpunk does on my 6 month old PC gaming rig. 

The music is no were as good as GTA music is. General I find myself turning it off and listening to pandora. Combat with guns is wonka at time and general picking up the sword is easier.

Clothing choices and personal chara design is lacking a major disapointment, as is the fact I can have cyber eyes, but can not see in the dark, or my nav waypoints look no different then looking at my smart phone for google maps.

The devs talked about chara choices, and you can pick the size of your little man, but zero choices on tattoo places or types, no clothing choices just random misc match styles, no choice on how your cyberware looks."
1609564287,the game is fun WHEN YOU ACTUALLY FUCKING GET IT TO WORK. as of writing this ive had the game crash on me about 50+ times. i currently have only 7-ish hours on it as well
1609564259,"Maybe redeemable if they pull a nomansky, but in the current state the game is a buggy mess, requiring constant reloads of checkpoints, unable to pick up half the items on the ground. MASSIVE cut content.. more information from the net.
Interesting soundtrack and some physics concepts, otherwise lacking quite basic standards..
Currently I do not recommend."
1609564222,"This is RIDICULOUS.....You all should have waited to release it.. There have been delayed releases to fix games before.. This is just SLOPPY!! It wont even launch on my system.
I got 2 copies.. One for my little brother and for myself.. Very disappointed."
1609564204,"buggy at times and my 1060 cant handle mid/max settings but story and gameplay is worth the trip, not the "" it will come out when its ready"" CDPR promised to deliver but enjoyable on its own"
1609564180,"Cyberpunk 2077 is a great game with lots of content, much more than most. It is refreshingly different with an adult theme. It is only single player at the moment but just this mode gives you more than your money's worth. The game runs well on PC if you meet the minimum specs. Yes there are glitches but no where near as bad as people say. The people complaining are mostly running it on underpowered systems like original PS4 and Xbox One. What did they expect?"
1609564039,"A few bugs, but great!"
1609564019,"Purchased a few days before release, I was surprised to see so much negativity about the game in the first few weeks - glitches, features that were advertised were missing, complaints of over-hype and under-delivery.  Although I have had some glitches here and there, I have had little to complain about and have found a lot to like about the game.  

After twenty plus hours playing and exploring side quests I feel like I'm getting a good feel for the game and I can favourably compare it to Skyrim.  Its immersive, there is plenty to do and have found hours slip away while playing the game. Some of the skill and perks menus are difficult to understand and navigate, and I would have struggled understanding parts of the game without resorting to online sources for hints and tips. The combat options are so varied that I found trying to quickly mix hacking and physical combat difficult. Making my enemies' electronic implants stop working before I quietly took them out with a knife seemed like something I was capable of doing, but making that happen was something I struggled to master. Perhaps I was too ambitious rather than it being any fault of the game?  Perhaps its a testament to the freedom the game has that I could even consider the option?

Despite the criticism laden upon the game at its launch, I can see that this will be a game that I will be coming back to again and again.  Just one more side quest... just one more upgrade... just one more cruise around a very pretty and atmospheric city...  

Buy it.

"
1609564017,"Okay, I like this game. I know it got a lot of hate for bugs but I am having a good time with it and haven't encountered anything game breaking just yet. HOWEVER... *Potential Spoilers*

Delamain... Maybe I am crazy for this being my main beef.. But if you get to the point where you unlock Delamain Jr... He needs more speaking rolls. I haven't heard much out of him since the end of the quest and when he does speak it isn't enough. I want another companion. I want to talk to him and hear his take on what I am doing, where we are going, etc. It can be up to V whether he wants to share the info, and Delamain Jr being a true AI can be offended by his remarks or not. 

I just like the idea of saying ""I'll be back"" when I get out a car. And a car saying ""How'd it go?"" when I come back in it. Or even a ""Hope you weren't waiting long, traffic am I right?"" When I call the car.. Basically, more DELAMAIN JR. I don't use any other car despite their better perks, I use Jr because he is sentient and needs a friend. SO MAKE HIM MY FRIEND =("
1609898883,"---------------------------------------------DO NOT BUY THIS GAME-------------------------------------------
Once again, another game developer and broken promises. In 2012 CD Projekt Red told us about their new game, Cyberpunk 2077. In the course of the next 8 and a half years we heard and saw many things that were ambitious and incredible claims about what we would see when it was finished. Now after 3 delays Cyberpunk 2077 has arrived... UNFINISHED! Almost everything they showed off in their Night City show case videos were cut from the game. The list is too long but if you google Cyberpunk 2077 Cut Content you will be treated to hundreds of videos who all have the receipts. 
If you must buy this game, if you cannot resist, then don't pay Full Price. 
I love Cyberpunk the RPG, and there is a lot that I love about this unfinished mess. My hope is that there will be a No Man's Sky redemption story - where CD Projekt Red patches their game to resemble what they showed us over the last 3 years; or at the very least - what they showed us over the last 18 months. If they cannot do this - then I hope the law suits against them do what our reviews could not."
1609563736,"Great game, save often, glitches on PC are practically non-existant."
1609563710,"Despite this game needing a buff ass machine to run, it runs fairly well on my machine (Ryzen 5 3600, GTX 1070Ti, 16GB DDR4) albeit only running on a mixture of medium and high settings. I get around 60fps. Okay about the game. IT IS FUCKING AWESOME HOLY SHIT. Yeah that's all. 10/10 penises."

1609563620,"bugs dont take away from the story, gameplay, visuals, characters, and writing."
1609563470,"I'm saying yes, but really that comes with some caveats.

I'd REALLY recommend you make sure you got the specs for it to account for the bugginess. It's actually a pretty good game with a decent story and characters, and I really enjoyed it. Which is saying something considering how buggy the game can be at times as well as how much polish and basic quality of life features it lacks in certain areas- almost insultingly so. At the same time, once you get in the swing of things, get better weapons, a decent amount of perks, and an idea of how to fight, it can be so much fun. Doing a super jump into the middle of a group of enemies, shooting a rocket out of your arm while in mid-air, and cleaning up the rest with a katana all in the span of 10 seconds had me feeling like a stupidly OP anime character.

The characters and story were also actually good. It's rare I actually come close to giving a shit about romance options as well. Without spoilers, the endings also felt decently executed, albeit a little disappointing.. but not in a way I'd take points off, personally.

My advice to anyone that wants to try it: 
1) If you are patient and can stomach reloading saves when bugs happen, and also have a decent enough rig, there's plenty to be enjoyed.

2) Wait a few months/year/more, snag it on a sale, pray that a decent modding scene has been able to sprout up and fix CDPR's shit so you can properly enjoy what it has to offer, a la VtM: Bloodlines.

3) Just say fuck it and play it now because you wanna flex on your friend's toasters. Whatever, yolo.

4) Wait until CDPR fixes everything, shortly after HL3 comes out.

5) Just go play Deus Ex or someth idk"
1609563463,Played quite well and is fun so far
1609715225,"TLDR: There is an amazing game in here somewhere; however, it's not here today. Subjectively, I really liked this game hence the Rec. I want to see this game succeed. Cyberpunk2077 offers an engaging, Hollywood cinematic experience that was compelling to follow from start to finish. The bottom line is: CDPR tried to do way too much that, at the end of the day, they failed to deliver everything they had promised. While I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Night City (NC), I can't speak for everyone. IMO, your enjoyment of the game really depends on how you compare your experiences with similar games of this genre as well as your tolerance of bugs and the apparent shortcomings that plague your gameplay experience. If you want the feeling of diving in and experiencing this game for the very first time, I WOULD NOT get this game right now.

Similar Games:
Mass Effect Trilogy
Grand Theft Auto V
Fallout 4

GOOD: 

Story: 
It's good.  I wasn't intrigued with the Corpo path when I first started the game, and switched to StreetKid--which hooked me right away. It felt like an underdog story of a rise to fame (like Franklin in GTAV) and I was immediately sucked into how to role play the character and her interactions with the rest of the cast. Writing is top notch, which is prevalent in both the narrative and its characters. While it *does* present the illusion of choice which, although it was a pretty glaring shortcoming, I still feel the story is palatable enough for many audiences to still be an enjoyable experience. Think: Mass Effect. 

Character Builds:
There's a lot. 

First-Person POV (Immersion):
This was a mixed bag and the first misstep made by CDPR. When they had first revealed the game, it was announced that the game would include both first person (FP) and third person (TP) point of views (POV)--all of which were featured in their 40min reveal demo they revealed in E3. I was so disappointed to learn like a month or so later that they had completely scrapped this because they wanted a ""fully immersive"" experience for the player. I call bull. Even Bugthesda had figured out this POV formula all the way back in 2003's MORROWIND.  I played Baldur's Gate 3 this very same year and was spoiled with the fact that, while the game is entirely an old-school CRPG style game, it had full TP cinematic cutscenes and dialogue. This is the best way to really connect with your character! This is not to say that you *can't* connect with your character. I played Female V the entirety of the game and I thought the voice performance was grade A, outstanding and  Cherami Leigh did an amazing job with the character. The emotional sections really hit and I felt for her character, which allowed for me to make the decisions that I thought her character would be making. This is a sign of great writing and quest design (although we will get to the latter later) . CDPR wasn't deceptive in that FPOV is the best way to get an immersive experience, I personally enjoyed it towards the end, I just felt that removing TPOV was a hasty decision and a missed opportunity.

THE BAD

""In Night City, looks are everything."" 
This quotation was literally plastered at the very top of the character customization screen. This is deceptive. You would think that, in a futuristic world where cybernetic enhancements are possible, that CDPR can do the bare minimum of allowing you to change your character's appearance in game. There are no hair stylists, tattoo artists and/or Auto body-shops in the game that allow you to customize your ""looks"" however you want. Like, DUDE, your previous WITCHER games had ingame customization! This was a GROSS oversight. You can't even change your cyberware to be an awesome, Adam-Smasher looking cyborg...and, despite CDPR's previous statements, these cybernetics don't even change how your character is perceived by the world. There is literally no downside in modding your character out with as many cybernetics as possible...no loss in ""humanity"" or consciousness. 

Clothes:
Equipment in this game is a joke. Firstly, from what I could tell in my first playthrough, clothes options are quite limited in terms of style. Unless you'e fine with a handful of styles from a limited selection of leather jackets, you're pretty much stuck the entire game with mismatched clothing options and/or gym shorts. I wore a 10 armor tank-top with 30% Crit Damage the entirety of the game. If you're playing on higher difficulties, as I did, you would be doing yourself a disservice playing sub-optimally unless you keep up with your equipment (many of which, if you're killing higher level targets, are level locked anyway). By the end of the game, my character looked like a cross dressed hillbilly (granted I was doing insane amounts of crit damage with my weapons); although, thankfully, I was able to get my hands on a nice, black netrunner outfit that made me feel immersed with my stealth character.

Weapons:
The guns here were pretty cool. While you are *still* very limited in the makes of each weapon type (i.e. if you're running ARs, all I've found are Copperheads everywhere...good luck), there was just enough variety between the Power/Tech/SMART weapon types that I didn't really have an issue with variety. You're allowed 3 slots (which I wish CDPR would expand in future updates of the game with like backpacks and loadouts) and I had a weapon for every situation--my silenced revolver for high sneak crits, a tech revolver for behind-the-counter shootouts and an upgradeable, unique silenced sniper rifle (which you can receive from a Panam side mission, btw). I didn't even touch any other gun aside from those that had higher damage values for each of my weapons (listed above). So, no complaints from me; however, it's still a pretty glaring shortcoming that other people might have gripes about. 


THE UGLY:

Crime System: 
Jesus, this was god awful. Cyberpunk tries to have a GTA system with the (1-5) star/bounty system, but it's a mess. Cops literally spawn around and behind you. One moment you're dashing through gunfire to get behind cover; and, as you're popping off  thinking you're safe...lo and behold: drones, cops and MAXTEC spawn directly behind you to put you to bed. It might be my Glass Cannon build, but I'd like to see someone survive on Hard/VeryHard.  So, what's the best way to avoid crime? Get in your car and drive a mile. That crowd you just murdered? Forgotten. You'd think that, in a world where video/audio surveillance and braindances exist, escaping crime would be near impossible.  

Main Story (PACING): 
You thought Fallout 4's main story was bad? The narrative feels rushed. It rushes into the main premise of the story right after you're introduced to the world, giving the player an unnecessary feeling of urgency so that participating in ANY side mission feels grossly irresponsible---unless your character was like ""fuck it"" and became a murder hobo. I also hadn't realized that I'd gotten to the point of no return so, once I got there, I was livid. There were a lot of previously interesting characters who never really  got closure towards the end, which left a sour taste in my mouth. 

Bugs: 
They didn't bother me. The only thing that bothered me was their failure to tune some in-game scripts. I hate being locked out of dialogue. Because the dialogue in this game is quite spontaneous, there would be times in which I would be locked out of entire dialogue trees because of the constant Relic Malfunctions that are littered throughout the game.  


There is so much more to be said about this game, but I am happy with everything I've managed to get written down here. Cyberpunk is not a bad game, and I eagerly wait to see what CDPR has in store for the future."
1609563298,It gets worse the more I play it. The story is the only redeeming quality the game has. Everything else is a shitstorm of design fails. Let this be a lesson to developers. Your shit can stink even if you're CDPR.

1609563198,"played 4 hours and got to a spot where you control a memory, the game already made me feel slightly queasy and the dream section full on made me feel ill, so i quit.

1609562745,Hands down my favorite game of all time. Full stop.
1609562720,Lies
1609650520,Its an amazing mess of a game.
1609562644,super fun
1609562613,"I'm going to sidestep the bugs & glitches, as those are easily remedied in short order.

I'm disappointed in just how little game is in here, honestly. It's pretty to look at, fun to walk around in, but at the end of the day, this ""open world"" appears to be just a bit too rigidly attached to rails to make it as exciting as it was originally pitched to be, honestly. Even if you do what I did and draw it out as much as possible, you just run out of content far too quickly. The gameplay becomes too repetitive - and I'm usually OK with that, if there's reason to repeat it. But, there isn't. The fun part? [spoiler]Even if you finish the game's main story line, you're still stuck with Johnny in your head should you want to continue playing - you're ""done"" with the game when you complete the main story line, so your only option should you want to continue playing is to have the game rewind you back to just before the ""point of no return"" mission, where you simply ""pretend"" that the game didn't just end. it's frankly bizarre.[/spoiler] 

Character development's arbitrary, to the point that I'm not sure if it's even useful to worry about it overmuch. There's no real incentive for multiple play-throughs, and it very much appears that you can just... run out of content, as nothing's random and there's relatively little scripted content.  If you try to go outside of that scripted content, especially by committing criminal activity like brushing up against a corpo or standing next to a cop for too long, well, enjoy your Crime Prevention System beatdown by teleporting cops & drones. The game punishes you for deviating from expected play - the very antithesis of ""open world.""

I'm sorry, I truly am, because I was amped for this game, but... it's not ready. It's not an open world game. It's not an RPG. It's not a solid action game. Here's hoping that, in the weeks & months to come, CD Projekt actually delivers the game they told us they were going to deliver."
1609562539,"A couple of bugs aside, I currently find this game enjoyable and the story very compelling."
1609562363,"A truly nextgen masterpiece.

What a ride that was. 

"
1609562234,"Honestly I'm enjoying this game so far. Yes it has some bugs, but pretty much all I've encountered are just visual glitches and the occasional ragdoll clipping which I personally find hilarious.

I do think the game could stand to run better, I've got a decent PC and I think it should be able to run more than just barely 60FPS at medium settings. But its not unplayable or even annoying to play at its current performance level. I do hope there will be improvements down the line, but as it is for me at least, its perfectly playable.

So far I'm enjoying the missions and I particularly like the crafting, but it did feel like a bit of information overload at first.

So theres my take on it, do with it what you will."
1609562212,pretty cool
1609562208,"Listen I love this game. I wouldn't have played it if it wasn't fun. But they lied to people and ruined the reputations of individuals in order to avoid delaying this game and releasing it when it was ready. It runs like garbage if you don't have the latest graphics card (I'm running this on a 2070S and it has crashed on me one time in my 75 hours), the AIs are terrible, police will teleport behind you if you commit a crime, you can steal from NPCs right in front of them and they won't react,  driving is god awful, you can't customize your appearance after the fact, no minigames to make the world feel real (there are so many arcade machines you can't use), and not enough upgrades and abilities to make gameplay feel versitile. Also they need to add a transmog function cause my character is still running around in a cowboy hat because that is the best head armor I've found. I know they will fix this game in the future with a ton of ""free"" updates and maybe shoe horn in some expansions but that is such BS. This game was not done and you can clearly see all the areas where they cut corners. I know one day this game will be truly great but even then I don't believe anyone should buy it. It gives these companies the freedom to believe they can release half finished garbage and patch their way to completion in a year or two. I pay full price for a full game not a half assed, buggy mess."
1609562133,"Any game that gets me to start reading a new slew of books is great, but CDPR really knocked this out of the park.  The only disappointment I might have is if the DLC doesn't take us into orbit, but even then I wouldn't care that much as long as it continued to be as fun as the base game."
1609562017,"The world is so detailed, it really sucks you in and makes you want to return to Nigh City."
1609561998,Yes this game is glitchy as fallout 76. But beneath that is a truly great game.
1609561983,"Cyberpunk 2077. There's a lot that can be said about it. Yes, it has it's bugs, absolutely it does. 
I've been flung across the map, I've died from running down the stairs to fast and some quests are a pain due to these bugs.

Regardless of the bugs, CD PROJEKT RED created a world of beautiful graphics and a story that'll punch you in the gut and spit you out. The lore of both main and side quests is awe inducing, it is so well done. CD PROJEKT RED might have not released a bug free game, but dear lord the story they created lifts the game to a height that most story based games don't even get near. 

Here's a list of pro and cons and the above is my own personal opinion of the game

Pro's 
+ Variations within the perk trees allow for all kinds of different approaches. Front liner, Hacker, Gunslinger, Assassin, Brute force, Sniper or a little of everything. 
+ Amazing story that'll turn even the manliest of men into little girls
+ The lore within the game is incredibly well thought out and written
+ Decent amount of weapons to be found, both normal and iconic
+ Gameplay does not get stale or boring (played for over 227 hours at the time of writing this and will be going back in again for a different life path + perk build) 
+ Graphical master piece
+ Finishing missions/quests and small stuff always feels rewarding
+ A very involved dev team determined to give us a better game as quickly as possible. (6 patches within 3 weeks, fixing some major issues is pretty impressive). 
+ The voice-Acting is top class

Con's
- Unforunately, the bugs are still very present and the can be minor visual bugs, annoying ""now you're suddenly hurt/dead"" bugs and for some quests (at the time of writing) completely breaking. Luckily off the hundreds of quests I've done I've only had 1 quest that was impossible to do.
- Crafting system could do with an option to select how much of something you want to craft, right now you have to craft everything one by one. 
- Clothing mods, weapons mods and character stats do not function properly (again at the time of writing) and character stats do not properly show your actual stats.
- unskippable cinematics - They are powerful and beautiful, but when you're doing a 2nd or 3rd game it would be nice to have at least the option to skip it. 
- The AI could do with some work. At the moment the NPC's are rather.....dumb."
1609561834,"Cd Projekt Red basically ripped everyone off.

This game is rushed, broken, incomplete, it's just all so badly planned and executed.

The worst part is that I'm not able to refund it. Thank you, Steam, for fucking me up."
1609561777,it's okay
1609561777,Cyberpunk is a fun game when you don't have some asshole constantly telling you it isn't
1609561658,very nice. 11/14
1609561657,"I have had some of the worst luck with this game. Some of it unrelated such as a hard drive crashing, other parts completely the games fault - such as constant crashing during launch, the corruption of a save file making my 50 hour+ game unplayable etcetera. 

It also has enough bugs and glitches in it to make a bethesda release blush. However, with all of this being said, I cannot recommend this game enough. Some of the characters are so well developed I feel as though I am watching a show at times. I love the characters of Johnny, Jackie, and Panam. 

If you love cyberpunk aesthetic and a great Single Player Story Driven game, then this game really is for you. Even if you have to wait for the next few patches to go through so that it is stable enough for you to play."
1609561632,"Its not amazing as The Witcher 3, but in overall its a good game. Recommended"
1609561631,Turgid.
1609561397,"Think the game is fine. Many bugs to fix but good story, Maybe even, too much good story. To the point where i wanna throw my monitor cause iv'e been stuck in a 10 minute dialogue session."
1609561318,The core game is great. Just wait for bug fixes before buying. Cant even play 2/3 of the life paths due to crashing.
1609561170,its fn amazing
1609561169,Honestly this game does have fun gameplay with the combat sequences but till the end I can't recommend this game the character customization is like that of dog shit and the ending sequence is broken. on top of that if you don't hug johnny's nuts the entire time you can't get the secret ending save your money on this game and buy it when its  on sale
1609561074,Great Story
1609561061,"Despite the backlash the game has gotten, after a few bug fixes and playing through the game a second time, this open world rpg is truly a well made game which I'm sure CD Projekt will delve more into their creation with additional content and DLCs and possibly more installments of this game, game is not perfect by any means but it is a fun game!"
1609560874,This is a unfinished game with so many stupid bugs and even when you moving around the views its like missing parts wtf...
1609560873,have not run into any major bugs you'll be fine. fun game very goof
1609560815,.
1609560787,"There are a few bugs that need to be polished out but looking at the game overall I felt a refreshing pull to the game. 160 hours in before it started to feel monotonous. I think the side missions and assaults, etc have their limit of entertainment but the multiple choices in combat and general game play left plenty of room for customization. Gunplay felt fast and accurate plus the different options for melee are fun as well. The story feels like it is evolving as you play and it rarely feels like repeating the same mission over and over. Would recommend to anyone as a relaxing rpg. On hard this game really doesn't pose much of a challenge."
1609560768,cyber
1609560564,wait for the big january and february patch before making a decision on whether or not to buy this game.
1609560483,"Bad menu configuration, buggy as hell, and boringly repetitive."
1609560481,I like the bugs
1609560514,"I am enjoying this immensely, two thumbs up. Is it a great game... it will be soon. 

Yes I recognize that it really needed serious optimization at release. Yes I realize that the old consoles really are not up to the task and it would have been better for everybody if they did not try. Yes I could be biased. Yes I have a fairly decent machine. Yes I understand why the credits are longer than most/all movies. Yes I still say that this is a great game."
1609560437,good
1609560432,fuck
1609560417,"I completed this game 100% all achievements n' stuff, i cannot recommend this game in this state or without heavy discount.

That said, if it was ever optimized and bugfixed too a heavy degree, Marvelous game."
1609560387,"So this game was overhyped into oblivion and there is no way this game was ever going to live up to the expectations, but at the end of the day it still turned out to be a great game. CDPR may have overpromised and under delivered and do deserve a lot of the shit they are getting for it, but I have to give credit where credit is due. 

The story of the game is great and in the about 50 hours or so I played of the game start to finish and doing the vast majority of the side quests, all of it was super fun. Keanu does a great job with his part in the game and having his character along with you for the whole ride was a really cool feature.

I do have to point out the bugs and technical issues as they can be a serious problem. I didn't hit any game breaking bugs but a lot of loopy shit happened and I had to reinstall the game twice because of downloaded files randomly going missing every time they patched the game. Despite these frustrations I still felt it was worth it to play the game, but definitely a pain in the ass. As long as your setup is half decent and can handle this game I would say it is well worth it."
1609560243,"Just shy of 50h in the game, might still have a few in me before I wait for some very much required updates.

One thing to add before this: I have a not-so-great pc rig and this game ran fucking goooooooood on it. Props to CDPR, they did optimize the game well enough to run on old tech. Too bad consoles can barely run the game, but CP77 runs really good on a R9 380. Albeit on basically min specs, but I got enjoyment out of the game running it on my PC with what I felt was like 60 fps, with some dips in some area's.

Just finished the main story, did a handful of side quests, before hand(wanted to see if I could get Johnny's gun before the final mission), and spent a fair amount of it trying to figure out the armor/build system. All in all, I enjoyed the game quite a bit. Story, from what I've seen, was great! Voice acting was too. However, the bugs in this game... CDPR is probably working like crazy to fix that shit. Sure as shit hope they are, because some of the issues impact negatively towards my enjoyment of the game.

Most particularly the build system. Shit just doesn't work. There's a mod that adds 15% crit chance and 30% crit damage. Managed to snag it from a vendor - which naturally means I managed to dupe it about 60 times since item duping is the game is a thing. It plainly doesn't add the stats to your character's sheet. It's basically a useless armor mod. On top of that, why bother adding the ability to - in armor with multiple mod slots - even equip multiple of them? Legendary armor generally has 4 mod slots, so you ""could"" add 4 of them if you wanted to one piece of gear. That would be 60% crit chance and 120% crit damage right? Except not because it doesn't stack and, once applied, if you don't have a perk that gives you back your mods, you've basically deleted that mod.

There's so much more that's wrong with gear builds and the characters stats alone that make me want to wait until they fix it to go back to the game. I got 50 hours of entertainment out of it, and I think that with the character stats system working properly that I would probably get another 50 out of it. Close to it anyways. 

I'd still recommend playing it for the story. It was entertaining and, c'mon, keanu fucking reeves! Let's fucking go bois!"
1609560205,"Love the atmosphere and all of the little details the developers at CDPR put into this. Yes, it has some bugs but really enjoying this game overall. Turn the mini map off and just learn the streets to get between places and enjoy the wonderful layout of the city. There's also so many different branching dialog options to explore the story differently and even play styles to try."
1609560525,"I bought this game on Steam expecting a better experience than on my PS4, however the game crashes before it can even launch to the main menu.
I have looked up solutions to this problem and have tried multiple things to get this game to even launch.
Mind you, my PC can run most games at max settings very well.
Extremely disappointed."
1609560153,"beat the game once, took 30 hours. went for a 2nd play through, glitches or not, theyre trying to fix em ASAP and the game is pretty enjoyable. One glitch where you cant equip certain items cause it keeps saying action block, you literally go to a joytoy to fix it, lmaoooo."
1609560109,"Graphics look great, some story is gripping but doesn't feel/look like anything they promised years ago. It appears they either rushed it out or lied. The game features that were promised and advertised were all gutted to a shell of what it was intended to be. 

I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm not to fond of being tricked into beta testing a game for $60. Did anyone actually play through the game at all before it was released? $$$ is king though. I'm sorry to say that CDPR is up there with Activision & EA as far as ""Screw the customer, get that money""."
1609560100,"great game DESPITE the bugs

just get it if you like cool ass looking shit"
1609560069,"absolutely adore this game, theres so much stuff to do, all the negative reviews are bull, if you want a game basically as diverse and interesting as elder scrolls, give this a try"
1609560018,very good
1609559971,"I feel fortunate to have a machine powerful enough to play this game. I feel bad for those who are having issues, and I am frustrated for you all that CDPR has not resolved all of the issues so many are experiencing. That said, I am 11 hours into the game and I have not experienced any glitches that have taken me out of the experience at all so far. I recognize that I may be in the minority having a good experience with this game. I have a lot of great things to say about it. It is very atmospheric and there is a ton of minute details that have been incorporated into this game. The story is very engaging so far, and I think once CDPR recovers and overcomes the issues with this game (they probably should have waited to release it, but that is just how this industry seems to work nowadays), I believe this game will be looked upon very, very fondly in the future."
1609559890,"A GTA clone set in a discount Blade Runner world.  There are some slight RPG elements to the game. It is good, but not great. However, since the latest update it is nearly unplayable."
1609559820,"Highly recommend. I guess bugs would depend on your hardware. Personally, I've experienced next to none without having a super crazy rig. I just about perfectly meet the ""recommended"" hardware. Story is great, choices DO matter, and the open world feels more alive than any comparably sized open world I've played. Driving can be clunky, but different cars handle differently and some drive like a dream. I didn't know much going into the game, and I was thoroughly impressed. It's all I've played recently."
1609559810,"First Impressions. Some bugs, odd NPC actions, police spawn right on top of you. That being said, WOW... NC is a sight to behold, the detail the depth of field, the solid textures. Hats off to CDPR this is a Masterpiece and i am  sure it will only get better. 9.5 After bugs fix 9.8 after fixing police spawns and syncronized civilian movements 10.0 and if they can maybe DLC in some fun activity's like a future amusement park with rides and games, more romance probably an 11."
1609559787,"The good:
Great story writing - likable characters.
The bad:
You already know.
"
1609559686,"Great immersion into a living, breathing, dystopian future. It's everything I wanted out of the game."
1609559681,"Just a bit into the game, but if you love RPGs and vibrant open worlds I don't think this game will disappoint you. I suppose the only question is: can your graphics card handle this game????????"
1609559608,Its been fun and runs good on my equipment with dlss... still a bit buggy but over all like 8.5 or 9 out of 10
1609561924,This game has great graphics on a high end pc. but thats about all that is next gen about it. I could not even finish the game because of the bugs driving me crazy and it got very boring so yea what a waste of time. plus ive now found a game breaking bug so i can not finish it this game sucks
1609559498,"Its an FPS RPG that feels incomplete with many promises made during pre-release not happening. Sure it may boasts it's brand new, next-gen graphics and has a cool story to boot but there's really no replayability, your choices doesn't matter in the end and the game itself is just too easy even on the hardest difficulty. In its current state, it is severely underwhelming for a game of this caliber and price, wouldn't even put this on the same pedestal that is Witcher 3."
1609559446,lol i shidded and farded
1609559360,"i love this game, i love it so much. the game play, the actions, the story, the music, not to mention the drama and emotions this game brings, its a heart touching game."
1609560033,if you don't mind visual bugs/glitches and the occasional game breaking bug its a fun game
1609559296,"For an entire week I have been running through night city slicing up gang members with mantis blades, taking horrible advice from Keanu Reeves, and despite all the hacking I did in the game I was still unable to fix the mountain of bugs this game has. Very great story game, but Id only recommend if you have high end specs. The game is just better with high graphics and anything bellow average will probably explode trying to optimize the game."
1609559289,Game has tons of content based in a beautiful and interesting world.  Multiple character choices to play the way you like.
1609559726,"I'm 36 hours in. I'll edit my review if ever I change my mind on the game.

However, to anyone who enjoys story driven games: ignore the noise. The backlash has been proportional to people's disappointment, not proportional to any objective measure. What I mean is that from reading comments before and after the release, some people were hoping this game would save 2020, if not save their lives. Some thought it would be the game of the century or the ""perfect"" game. Add in a pandemic making people crazier and angrier than ever, some hoping this would fail and a mob reaction and you had the perfect storm for people to pounce on this game. You just have to listen to how poor the quality of the reviews were, even from usually very good reviewers, to understand and realize how emotionally invested people were. 

But, anyone who played the Witcher 1 and 2 knows CDProjekt Red doesn't make perfect games. Witcher 3 was  was the culmination of a trilogy spanning years. Despite that, the combat was wonky, there were some long winded parts, the exploration wasn't as good as Skyrim or BoTW when that came out two years later.  You didn't really roleplay your own character, you roleplayed Geralt and while you had consequences to your choices, there were set answers to get the best outcomes. It wasn't like Original Sin 2 or Tyranny where you had a number of ways to get to where you wanted. The story and writing were absolutely fantastic though. So was the world.

And that's what Cyberpunk 2077 is. A narrative driven game with bar none the most beautiful open world city I've ever seen. The writing and story are quite easily the best I've seen from any game this year.  I've just done two side quests that spanned over an hour easily each that were more interesting than most games main stories. You feel an attachment to these characters very early, much like we did with, say, Vesemir. 

I can think of a scene in particular where, for a close friend, you recount stories of your friendship, offer him an object close to his heart, all while listening to a serenade played on classical guitar in B minor. Fantastic stuff, I read some people cried during that scene and I fully get why. That's an optional quest. 

This is why someone would buy Cyberpunk. For the story, the cinematic experience and the gorgeous decors and graphics. 

As far as what it needs work on, and this is very important if you're not sure about buying it:
The game has bugs. Mine has had mostly visual bugs. On my RTX 2060, I've managed around 40-60fps with ray tracing and custom graphics that closely ressembles Ultra (played a lot with it). Usually, ray tracing is unplayable for me, but with DLSS2.0, you barely notice the upscale and the uptick is amazing. The game is fine though without RT and I can run it easily over 60fps if I take out RT and instead go for SSR shadows. The game still looks gorgeous.

There are other things: the world doesn't interact much with you and the NPCs are mindless drones. There's close to nothing in terms of customization. The minimap is way too small. The driving takes a bit of time to get used to. It's not horrible by any means, but some will not like it. The game needs to be played at the highest difficulty for it not to be a complete breeze. Your choices don't matter as much as you'd hope. Outer Worlds, while inferior in every single other thing, did that much better. If these things matter to you, you should wait before buying. 

For the gunplay, it's not battlefield or Apex Legends, but it's honestly very good for an action/adventure RPG. Much better than Fallout 4 or Outer Worlds. 

I would say it's a better game than Ghost of Tsushima, but Ghost was more finished/polished. I'd give both an 8/10 (same with Fallen order, which would be a 7.5 or 8). For comparisons sake: Planescape Torment, San Andreas, Original Sin 2, Baldur's Gate 2, Breath of the WIld/Ocarina of Time/A link to the past, Chrono Trigger, KOTOR1/2, Witcher 3, Skyrim would be 10/10 games. GTA 5, Resident Evil 4, Titanfall 2 would be a 9/10s for me.  

If it was more polished/finished, it would be a solid 9/10. If they expanded the RPG elements, choices, added DLCs and more special encounters in Night CIty, it would be a masterpiece. So, my recommendation would be: buy it if you have a good card, aren't starving for money, can tolerate the unfinished part and love cinematic experiences in games. Don't buy it if that paragraph of negatives bothered you. Wait a year or two until everything gets added and buy the definitive/directors/whatever cut that will likely be amazing."
1609559050,Fun. So far on PC I've got around the bugs...
1609558985,This game is fantastic. If you mind the initial release bugs you can seriously recognize this might be one of the best open world games to date.
1609558838,even with all the negativity this is still a great game from a great company; the story is just as good aswell lots of complexity
1609558831,Dont buy nextgen games for last gen hardware and enjoy this masterpiece.
1609558824,ITS PENIS
1609558755,"Yeah played for a while now and am extremely happy. Sure I've had some minor issues but nothing that has really ruined the experience for me.

As an RPG- well you remember Dragon Age when that first came out? Or maybe Mass Effect. The engine did pretty good facial expressions, and the games had great voice actors. Well here in the major dialogues the actors will take a drink, look around, stand up and lean on something, pose aggressively and do hand gestures. Hell I was in one of the driving quests and I saw the person driving sort of lurch forward when they braked.

Right now I'm doing a Romance quest/event thing with Judy and it's near the end of the chain when the character is getting close. I've never had a quest in a game get me emotional like this. It just feels so special. 

As a shooter- you may be familiar with other games where you can do lethal or non-lethal takedowns. They have a morality system tied into that. Well you can do that here but there is no morality system tied to it. Some quests require non-lethal, a few require you to kill. Not following instructions loses you a bonus but that's it. You'l probably use lethal on maelstrom and scavs, they are awful people.

The game has a similar fast travel to The Witcher 3- point to point only. But driving just feels so good, even if the steering is janky and the minimap is not zoomed out enough catching turns.

Lastly is the character ""Fingers"". All the characters are so well written. But Fingers... he is just so disgusting. And the hand cream shit he uses ughh.... Not sure how you could not punch that scumbag.

But if the bugs you've seen are a negative for you, maybe wait for the free DLC in January."
1609558710,Yes sir!
1609558541,good game
1609558467,"I waited and waited for this game and have really enjoyed it. It is gritty, dark  and unapologetic about it. I have grown to care for the NPCs you meet and am very invested in the story. This does not feel rushed and does not feel like a rehash/ formulaic of every other game I've played. It often feels new and interesting for me. 

  I have experienced a few bugs, but nothing that makes me angry or has me shaking my fist at the sky wanting a refund.  The bugs I come across are the very rare physics problem where I've fallen through the mesh of the world, or objects held in an npcs hand (such as a cell phone) will remain floating in the air. 

 I would purchase again, at full price.
On the Technical side I would recommend it to friends with a good gaming rig. My machine is pretty good, so I could not tell you how older hardware will manage this very rich and detailed environment. Its beautiful for me, behaves the way it should most of the time.

On the STORY side, If you are triggered by .. oh boy.. There is a lot to be triggered by, depending on who you are.  
 Bad language, nudity, Sexual themes,  Rape, abuse, drug use etc... this probably is not the game for you.  If you are concerned I'd check out some gameplay before purchasing to get your feet wet."
1609558460,"I had minimal bugs, and the gameplay is great. I don't know it it's the greatest game ever, but it's pretty damned good.  Waiting to see what DLC and patching does for it."
1609558442,"good story, everything else sux"
1609601793,"(TL;DR at bottom)

As CDPR did with Witcher 3, they overpromised and underdelivered. 

It doesn't look as good as they promised (as with Witcher 3. I know people deny it but there's extensive evidence) 
It doesn't play as smooth as they show. 
It doesn't have as much depth as they claimed. 
It doesn't deliver as much choice as they said. 
It isn't as much of an RPG as they want it to be. 

All those things are super disappointing. I can go into detail of things that are missing or things I don't like such as how there's not even a ""barber shop"" or ""plastic surgery"" to change how you look past the character creation, nor are there many clothing options. All the NPCs have various clothing items that you, as the player, will never wear. This is extremely silly considering modifying your body is basically a cornerstone of Cyberpunk as a genre. Not to mention how lackluster the character creation itself is. Or how about there simply just not being very much exploration to do. It's a fantastically detailed city and I love the world, but there isn't much in it beyond the things you see on the map. There's just a lot of small things missing. No radio hosts, no random ""stranger encounters"" to bring life to the city. No progression in any other sense than money and levels, and the former just feels sort of pointless. You don't build an empire, a gang, a group or people etc. you just sort of exist and do job after job. Or how about some things just plain not being in the game such as them showing how V is going through their wardrobe in an immersive way but that being turned into menus now, or how all the talk of ""Cop AI"" and ""corruption"" but when you get cops after you they just spawn wherever you are, teleported in. It's just a lot of small things that they showed but ultimately removed or ""downgraded"" as it were with Witcher 3. 

ALL that negativity out of the way I find myself sad and, not to be dramatic but almost ""empty"" now that i've beaten the game. I wanted more, I wanted to stay in the world, I wanted to meet more people, listen to the sounds more, shoot more different guns etc. 

I found so many of the characters so well written and Keanu, while I think he's great, is not my favourite. I liked them so much, even though they were against me, that I was sad to see them out of the game. Particularly one character you meet early is suddenly just out of the game and I thought the character was so well CRAFTED, not just acted but written, animated and modeled that I wanted to interact with them more but they were just removed from the game in a GTA 3-esque way after doing a couple missions, they just vanished off the face of the earth. 

I was so immersed in the world. I loved walking around, interacting with people. The score (not the soundtrack mind you) was perfect for the game. It added a ton of atmosphere, the environments were amazing. I just wanted more and more, I wanted to stay. (The soundtrack was okay too, but I thought it was a little disappointing and at points cringy, like a set of very uninspired songs just singing ""Night ciiitaaayyyy"" like that's a thing. ON the other hand there were some very intereresting songs such as the industrial ""History"" song.

Gameplay wise, I found the shooting highly enjoyable and satisfying with a perfect amount of ""oomph"" - Stealth, while uninspired still left me satisfied when I succeeded in sneaking my way through a mission. There's plenty of skills and talents to go into. Too many almost, I felt I couldn't even try a quarter of it, which gives some replayability. Speaking of, I found a lot of the choices I made in the game, ultimately made no difference, sort of like a TellTales games, which, of course goes against replayability.
The driving was passable. I found a mod that made the physics of the vehicles a lot more enjoyable but I can't give CDPR credit for that. 

I have faith that CDPR, as with Witcher 3, will improve Cyberpunk and add many features to the game as well as give us some content in a (or more) meaty expansion pack(s) that I can't wait for!

TL:DR:
I think this game is worth playing. It's sad to see CDPR burn themselves, and their fans, yet again, by overpromising and underdelivering but ultimately I found the game EXTREMELY enjoyable, the characters very interesting, the gameplay fun, the environment great and I loved every minute of my stay in Night City."
1609558408,"Despite everything, I quite enjoyed this game. There's no denying how half cooked it feels, but what was presented to me was just engaging enough to have my head spinning to fill in the blanks for it-- a process that was sometimes rewarding and sometimes frustrating. The character work on display is by far the most engaging part of the whole thing, but the writing overall suffers from a truly bizarre, discordant pacing. Gameplay is engaging, but as you get later in the game, you spend more and more time fighting the bugs to continue doing what you're doing. There's the notion of a truly amazing experience in here, but it needed much more time. As it is, a solid B experience."
1609558402,"All the talk about the graphical glitches in this game has overshadowed the gameplay itself.  This game is deep with a very compelling story line and the best side missions, ever.  Love it."

For being rushed as it was in polishing, this is still rather polished and I've found no insurmountable problems. You can see they still have a ton of overhead for expanding the cybernetics and releasing DLC storylines, missions, and characters. I am well satisfied with this game, and it performs playably on my i7-4970K and GTX 1080Ti. I alienated Judy so bad she MOVED!"

Rating: 8/10
-1 Point: Bugs; should be resolved eventually
-1 Point: Unfinished elements; could be resolved in DLC 

This game is absolutely incredible. One of the best games I've ever played. A massive, immersive open world, a compelling story and solid RPG elements. Easily the best graphics i've ever seen, especially with ray-tracing enabled.

That being said, it probably needed another year or so. You can tell the direction the devs wanted to go with some systems 
but they simply ran out of time and you can tell at some points (ex: cut metro system). It'll be interesting to see what they add in the DLCs. There are some bugs but I have a pretty high tolerance for it. My experience wasn't that bad. Still loses a point for them.

It is not the game to end all video games, but it was an amazing experience to play and that's what we're here for, right?

1609557738,Awesome
1609557707,"A decent game when it works. Nothing genre redefining, as 8 years of hype would lead you to believe, but decent enough"
1609557669,"Though cyberpunk has a handful of bugs, it is still the most fun game I have ever played by a large margin. The story, combat, and character diversity are all awesome. I cant wait for the game game developers to fix some of the cyberware bugs like the legendary monowire having a smaller damage code than the epic version but all in all still a superb game."
1609557585,"This game is not that broken, internet mob mentality. Runs fine on my mid tier rig. I had a good time."
1609557576,"Love Love Love this game. After the 1.06 Patch and updating my drivers to the 12/15/2020 update, this game became very enjoyable and playable. I'm in love with the design of Night City. By far the most awesome video game city I've ever played in. I find myself just running through alleyways and heading up staircases just to see what the layout of the land is. The story is fun. Lots of Lovable characters. 

The ONLY major issue i have with this game, is that the AI is pretty basic and low quality. Both the pedestrians and the drivers. It kind of breaks the immersion sometimes when an NPC does something really random and robotic.

Night City could feel even MORE alive if the AI was on par with games like GTA V. I'm really hoping CDPR pulls this game out of the mud it's in and give Cyberpunk 2077 the glory we know it deserves. A game like this needs to stand the test of time. So far it hasn't done that, for the community as a whole. But I still got faith in them.

I only recommend you buy this game now, if you don't mind bugs and bad AI. Don't get me wrong tho, the bugs can be pretty funny sometimes."
1609557378,NOT BAD
1609557376,"I was expecting this game to be ground breaking but it's just a new game, nothing mind blowing. Can't even get past a side mission because the fighting is so basic and so janky, I get hit from 10 feet away and it's just garbage."

1609557133,Not right now if you can't stand the bugs. Not forever if you are expecting an RPG experience
1609557027,"Average fun, but buggy and soulless. 

I really do like parts of this game; I like many of the characters, I adore Johnny and I think the world has potential. However, (and I think everyone knows this by now), CDPR's trailers and promises were a lot more ambitious than what they gave us. Bugs aside, it's a bad RPG. The game feels hollow. The romances are lacklustre, most NPCs are wooden and just aimlessly bump into one another and barely any choice I've made in this game has mattered. 

I know they're promising free DLC and updates, but honestly, I don't know how they can fix the core of this game. Sure, they can improve the police AI so they don't have the memory of fruit flies and make vehicles stop exploding randomly...but the in-game world will still be a paper-thin shell of what it could have been. I really hope they feel some semblance of shame about selling a game in this shape after all the hype they created, but I know better. I'm really disappointed.

Is it a fun shooter? Yeah. 
Is Keanu Reeves as Johnny great? Yeah. 
Is it a good RPG? God no, somehow it feels shallower and more regressive than Fallout 4."

1609556775,"Good, fun, open world game that will entertain you if you weren't part of the group that thought that this game would somehow replace their lives."
1609556758,"Great Story, Great SandBox....CD projekt Red just needs to work out the bugs......"
1609556725,"Overhyped. 
Its an ok game at best.

NPCs and Cities are super generic, there is nothing revolutionary about this game, especially when you compare this type of open world to a RDR2, hell even AC has more NPC and world interaction than CP2077"
1609556639,"I recommend Cyberpunk 2077. Although there is a lot of controversy revolving around this game at the moment, it doesn't necessarily make it a bad game. I am a strong believer of the ""hype kills games"" statement, for the reason that nothing in life will ever live up to the hype/ expectations of consumers if blown up enough. This is the case for Cyberpunk. I went into this game practically blind. I saw a couple trailers a month before it came out and never got caught up in the hype. And I think this is part of the reason I love this game so much. Sure the game is unpolished, I think we all can agree on that. But that aside, this game is great. Now with almost all of the game breaking bugs fixed, the game is in a good enough state to be only played on PC or next gen hardware. 

Playing through, I genuinely felt that my decisions and actions mattered, making me feel immersed in the experience. I thought how in depth and believable the world and characters CDPR made in this game were very believable. I found myself coming to really like some of the characters and I was glad that they had so much personality. As far as gameplay goes, this game is nothing special. it didn't feel unique to me in any way. But may I remind you, this doesn't make it a bad game. Very few triple A games now, like Control, are able to achieve unique gameplay anyway. It would have been nice to see that in this game. As far as narrative, story, atmosphere, choice, and characters, Cyberpunk 2077 blows it out of the park. In my opinion small things like physics not being as good as GTA V, civilian/driving AI being simple, etc, are yes valid complaints, but are poor reasons to hate and dub a game ""bad"" or ""a joke"".

In summation, if you are into a good story, characters, and atmosphere, I recommend giving Cyberpunk 2077 a try. But with this, keep in mind this game isn't perfect and has its issues much like any other game glitches aside. With this game's vast Night City, in-depth side missions and story, it's safe to say that this game isn't as bad as some consumers are making it out to be. And for what it has to offer it's definitely worth 60 big ones.

1609556613,good shit
1609556560,"My friends been telling me to stop playing because of bugs and such but I can't because I know you will encounter many due to the nature of an open world game. Just remember, The Witcher 3 needs 1 year to be fully patched so why Cyberpunk can't just because this game was delayed for 7 years and toxic fans got their just dessert for their rushed demands?"
1609556486,less bugs than fallout and a better world at me
1609556479,"It has the same greatness and drawbacks as The Witcher 3: story, characters, atmosphere, and environment are interesting, entertaining, and make you want to dive deeper. The combat, enemy AI, and bugs detract, but not nearly enough to patina  its virtues."
1609556452,"There is no depth here, the story fall short... Keanu was a bad cast for a anarchist punk. But at times it was fun, some quests are nice and fun. But even if they fix the bugs I don't know if there es enough here to justify a full price buy. If you can get this at a discount go for it, but be warned"

not as buggy or messed up as people make out!!

make sure its downloaded on a ssd or m.2 tho as spining hard drive might struggle!"
1609556246,"Ok. Honest Review of the game. Here goes. 
Short story: Do i like the game and do i wish to play it again? Yes. Anything considered i love the game and will play it again. I took 83 h for my first playthrough to grind and see what the game is about and felt hungry for more in the sense of trying nomad and corporate aside of the first streetkid playthrough and ending. 

Long story: 
Graphics: It is within a month of release a bit buggy and crude even but still i can enjoy the wast environment of night city and what there is to explore. it felt a bit ACM like maybe at the beginning and i've waited for a decent game since Metro Exodus to have that great sense of gameplay and some environment in which you can enjoy the openess and everything. Freeroaming through the big map is alright and all what is happening around you feels great. RTX makes a difference of course but the whole ambience feels like it's there. 

Gameplay: you have choices on how you play. kind of like wolfenstein new order but more high tech. choose your own way to approach situations. i like it when games give you more freedom of choice and sometimes the controls do a bit too much like a slowmo when you don't need it and dodge when you happen to misstap a key but overall you got the situation under control if you want to. a lot of the sidemissions seem similar but then when you do enough of them there's enough difference to make it feel alright. i like the effort that has been put into the background of many of the missions but also i felt like i had wished for the whole city to be a lot more interactive than it was. then the whole game size would have most likely been many times bigger and taken a lot more time to get released. 

Sounds: the game soundtracks are one thing. they happen on specific missions and blend in well then there's also the radio channels you can choose for driving around when you don't want to fasttravel. somehow i came to like the vexelstrom channel. but during 83 h of gameplay maybe they started to sound a bit repetitive but then i just changed channel to get back to what i wanted to hear. overall the stepsounds, ambience and so forth were great. not too much to complain about here. 

Game bugs: the bugs i encountered were mostly object bugs where when you turned around fast you saw a spawn of npc close to you and also when on the move there were a few funny traffic issues with cars flying across an intersection or objects going poltergeistish. i didn't have any save bugs or difficulties playing the game. a couple things i missed were minimap zoom out at faster speeds, tracking for the cyberpsychosis missions and some other minor things. a bit gtaish with the npcs but still the voices for collisions and interactions were pretty funny. but many times the npcs felt pretty cold. maybe a bit more to choose from on jig jig street would have made up for this? :P

Longivity: the game still has a lot to come. couple dlcs and multiplayer but as from release i can see myself playing the other two backgrounds and variations after the first playthrough until more content. i liked the ending and i saw there are multiple ones so the game is not a one off but rather something that is replayable and has more paths to unlock. as for how those alternative paths go i don't know yet but even in the one playthrough there were multiple options and even if the other ones are somehow a fairly linear path with the first i think the street cred vs nomad vs corporate will make a mix of the story and the endings you choose may make the gaming experience different. and when you get into a game as much for the story and dedication then you get hungry for more. 

I recommend the game for those who like mass effect, gta, deus ex hr, metro kind of games and want to have more to explore and are a fan of cyberpunk. i liked it and can't wait to see what more it has to offer. enjoyed the first playthrough. Thanks for reading."

[b]10/10 From me chief, I ain't taking it back[/b]

[i]It's very easy to hate something when you focus only on bad qualities, just as it is easy to love something when you focus only on good qualities(:[/i]

The game is a masterpiece.
The only other time that I actually enjoyed a story-driven game [b]this much[/b] was during Wild Hunt and CP2077 definitely takes the spot right next to it on my list


The story along with V's potential development alone is worth the price and reminds me exactly why I prefer videogames over movies. I've never felt so connected to the playable character & others- everyone has their own flaws / strengths and the dialogue is really well-written, which makes the characters more relatable and likeable.
Story flow is dynamic, of course, depending on your choices and behavior towards other people. Your choices won't affect everything, but still a big part of the missions, which makes them as important as your gun.

The gameplay itself is not what I played this game for, yet I still enjoyed it big time nonetheless. Guns & melees feel very satisfying to use, quickhacking has a wide variety of uses & stealth is finally a viable option, so you don't have to just brute-force everything, since it may actually feel better to play smart for a minute in that scenario. You're not locked into stealth / brute force though so you can keep switching between the playstyles on the run, which creates the good feeling of freedom.
You have huge amount of options to choose from regarding your V's performance in combat, depending on where you invest your skillpoints, which weapons you use, what cyberware you're using and which mods on your gear you have. One of the smaller things I personally enjoyed was the option to craft your own consumables and ammo (among many other things), so your iron will never be empty.

Also, I absolutely adore the atmosphere setting for major plot parts. The devs really know how to invoke certain emotions in the player, considering they have music on & are paying attention to the game of course.

Should have waited a year and got it half off so that when I quit because I am bored, it doesn't hurt so much and make me want to leave a bad review."
1609555759,great game ai is a little dumb and the car physic is not responsive enough but overall a great game
1609555959,"Overall 6.5/10 
----------------
The game is fun, id recommend picking it up on sale or in 6-8 months when they have ironed out a lot of the bugs. However it a deeply flawed game - missing systems, inconsistent polish in mechanics and graphics - somethings like character models are incredible  - but then food item and debris look like they come from the Nintendo 64."
1609555735,"Mixed feelings for this recommendation. I love the game, and truly think the story and the world are worth experiencing, but picking it up right now requires that you're able to get it running decently and have a VERY high tolerance for bugs, glitches, and shoddy AI... hopefully after several months' worth of patches this will be easier to recommend, but for right now it's probably wisest to hold off on it."
1609555686,"I'm about a month into the game now.  I have seen a lot of articles that bash the game but did not match my experiences.  It was really great up until a week ago that I started seeing a few bugs here or there.   Not anything like I was reading and definitely not game killing bugs.  There are a few annoying bugs did come up though but seem to happen randomly towards the end and were gone after a game restart.  Like when the Relic malfunction starts to happen the screen will stay super blurry and normally goes away but once it did not but made it very difficult to see or play.  Never happened again though. 

The game play is great with a controller and works amazing with PS4 or Xbox controller as I tried both.  The story is pretty original and interactive to dialog choices for the most part.  There are so many side stories as well but most directly link to the main story at some point but it can take so many hours just doing side quest."
1609555669,Very enjoyable FPS RPG.

1609555516,"6/10 an ok experience with a truck load of content cut but visually is amazing.
The load times are very fast, its a shame that almost every quest is: go here and kill this, it felt like a far cry rip off. Blood dragon was the superior cyberpunk game.

Maybe once more content is added it would be better but I would hold off buying it until its on a big discount."

There are buildings I can see into and hear people in but I'm still locked out of it. Hopefully some of the updates will fix some of this and add some life to the map. I still give it a 8/10 and its definitely worth the money I have spent on it.

1609555222,Well i wanna start by saying overall this game is totally worth the money. great graphics. interesting music. intriguing story line. Good amount of depth.  lots and lots to do to keep you busy wiith out the repetative grind. good acting (for the most part). The attention to detail in this game is actually astounding. Projekt Red you did it again. Bravo. 10/10
1609555118,I cannot recommend this game. Its a beautiful world with nothing in it. Its an early access game released as a full product. The amount of cut content and bugs is staggering and unacceptable. We cannot let studios get away with releasing shoddy products and expect us to wait 6 months to year to deliver a fraction of what was actually promised.

1609555061,"Man,,, I'm so pissed off.

1609555060,"Man, what a wild experience this game was. A great story plagued with bugs and frustrations at every turn. Yet, despite all I've encountered and heard about, I found myself loving every second of it.

I'm no CDPR fanboy, nor do I hate them. I was excited about this game! Unfortunately, the hype wasn't met. Does that mean it's a terrible game? No. Sure, it's annoying every time you have to quit and reload your game to fix a bugged quest (which I had to do no less than 15 times). But if you can look past the unpolished exterior and allow yourself to connect with some of the themes and characters (*cough* Panam), I think you'll find a solid experience here.

I have only experienced a small fraction of what's here and am excited to delve deeper into the world of Cyberpunk 2077, even if it'll be fraught with more annoyances. It's not perfect, but it's not garbage either. There is still a lot of work to be done on this game for sure, but if you can look past all that for a moment, I think you'll find a great game to get invested in.

Hopeful for the future of this game"

1609554474,it keeps getting more broken as time goes on
1609554464,"Good game. There are the bugs, of course, but it's still a good experience. I look forward to see what updates and dlc stuff gets released."
1609554454,"This game has an amazing story, its very fun to play. Has performance / optimization issues as of right now. For 1080p 144hz or high frame rate fanatics, you better be busting out at least a 9900k and RTX 2080 Super or better if you want more the 90 FPS in night city at medium details RTX off."

1609554102,"Is it perfect? No. Is it an underrated masterpiece? Yes. Cyberpunk 2077 is the best RPG that I've played since Skyrim came out in 2011. The world building is amazing, the amount of quests is staggering, the gameplay loop is fast paced and enjoyable, and the story and characters are fantastic. If you can handle a few bugs you should have a good time. Bravo, CD Projekt Red, bravo."

1609553946,"109 hours in. 
So far, overall score: 8.9 / 10 
Upper range gaming PC with 1080TI.

Really enjoying:
Levelling up my headshot pistol build, with stealth and tech.
Tech Weapons that shoot through walls.
Starting battles in stealth and then going all Rambo.
Killing absolutely everything, and feeling awesome.
Occasionally taking on  way-too-hard random quests and feeling humble again.
Continuously improving gear and guns.
Headshots with rifles.
Going Samarai with a Katana.
Getting critical hits.
Riding the bike.
Looting the world - I mean SO MUCH looting.
Enjoying the story, characters and quests.

Not so much:
Too small radar so keep missing turns
Constantly converting inventory into components.

Bugs:
No game-breaking bugs encountered so far. (Unlike when I first played Skyrim - my all-time fave game)
Physics bugs are mostly just amusing.

1609553916,"Great immersion, graphics and storyline.  Not a perfect launch to be sure and some definite polishing that needs to happen.  I don't agree with the negativity surrounding this title, but then I don't have a last gen console.  I appreciate the patches and look forward to the devs continually improving the experience."
1609553913,fun game about collecting ashtrays
1609553747,spider poop
1609553866,"Combat and RPG systems are solid. It reminds me of Rage. Very hyped up but there have been similar games since then (Deus Ex, Watch Dogs). Still very fun. I can't comment on the console versions."
1609553679,Badass game. Bugs? Yeah there are bugs. You know what else has bugs? Life. Get over it and enjoy the game.

1609553416,good game
1609553296,"So the story is great, the graphics are great... Wait until it is 20 bucks. It is just so buggy and unfinished. I have trouble looting. One side quest I need to finish the psychokillers is broken and I will not be able to finish it.  It is not worth the money of a new game but when the price drops it will be good. The bugs include having to restart quests becuase they can't complete, unable to loot people, quests not leading you to the correct place."
1609553295,Game is incomplete. Play for the story but don't play this expecting any open world content. Police AI is non-existent. They spawn on you as soon as a crime is committed. GTA 3 had better police AI
1609553159,"Staggeringly good design, writing, sound track, etc. Held together with scotch tape and bubble gum, but every game gets patched these days."
1609553153,"The game is filled with bugs, and a lot of systems are clearly unfinished (police wanted system, enemy AI, fast travel, etc.). BUT the game underneath all of that is so good, that even with it losing a lot of merit due to these issues, I am still enjoying my time and feel that I have received my money's worth."
1609553147,"If your graphics card can handle it, its a super fun game, glitches and all. I wish people didn't pressure Projekt Red to release this when it did, it was fun to play, but I can still see the shortcomings. All in all, if you're not on a last gen console, or have a pretty nice PC, its DEFINITELY worth a play through."
1609553128,honestly a good game if you look at it as an unfinished project. Sure there are (sometimes significant) bugs here and there but most things have a workaround.
1609553112,Story is good.  Game play is fun.
1609553106,"It's a great game on pc and I really wonder why it receives so much hate since it's a game that just got out and still has room for upgrades, anyway people who compare this game to GTA for exemple are not realistic, sure it's a game that's been out for a while now but in that while they had time to add many features that were not on the game to begin with, anyway just give cyberpunk a chance to improve, I bet it'll be one of the best games in a few months from now, even right now it's one of my favorites."
1609553045,Its fun
1609553045,"Cyberpunk is a love-hate relationship.  It is difficult for me to describe just how I feel about the game.  I typically enjoy open world games.  I typically do not play sci-fi, futuristic styled games.  That being said, I really enjoyed Cyberpunk.  Really, really enjoyed it.  I was enjoying it so much that I unknowingly binged through the main quest line, therefore completing the game in very little time.  I never once returned to V's apartment, I never purchased a gun, I never purchased any new threads, I never once visited a rippedoc other than what was needed during the quest line, I never upgraded V's cyberware or OS, I never purchased a new vehicle, I never dismantled items or tired to craft new and improved items.  It isn't that I didn't want to do any of those things.  I never had the eddies to purchase any weapons worth purchasing.  Any of the weapons I found on the ground were better than anything I could afford.  I never had enough eddies to even think about upgrading V's vehicle.  And since I would have rather upgraded my weapons or maybe even some badass cyberware I never even bothered to go shopping for clothes, go to any bars or eat anything.  Before, I knew it I was playing out the final few jobs of the main quest and it was suddenly over.   It was as if we went from the character development right to the conclusion of the story in a blink.  To complete the game without having the chance, opportunity, or even the requirement to experience many of the things around Night City leaves a sour taste and in fact blemishes an otherwise fantastic story.  

I would still highly recommend Cyberpunk.  But, perhaps this isn't so much of a review as it is a warning.  Take your time, take it all in."
1609553026,"The game has some bugs, but still the best of 2020."
1609552921,"I'll start this off by saying that this IS a good game, but it is not what was promised.

It's fun, like, really really fun and it has sooo much potential to be better as long as CDPR listens to their playerbase like they did with TW3. It has SOME RPG elements, but not as many as they promised multiple times. It has it's bugs, every game does at launch and it really seems as if they're working hard to fix the bugs before digging into the bigger issues. Here's to hoping they fix the bugs and give us what was promised."
1609552898,"For a game that I was so excited to finally play, I didn't expect to be disappointed so often. I ran into too many glitches and bugs throughout the game which either ruined the immersion or just made me quit out of frustration. Although this game has its faults, I found myself at times enjoying the story line and the detail put into the open world gameplay. I like that I can customize V and get immersed into the character itself rather than feel like an outsider."
1609552865,"After many hours into the game it's abundantly clear that, at some point, regardless of armor, perks or cyberware, you just start taking a retarded amount of damage. If you're not pure melee with lifesteal OR cheating to get 5-20k armor then you'll just be this tiny, infantile, b!tch-ant that even a common NYC rat can kill with zero effort. Idk wtf is going on but this happened to two of my characters now without chaning the difficulty. Right around level 25 you start getting your asshole ripped open like you're backing into a d!ildo-shaped semi. Cool. Yet another phaggy game that pigeon-holes you into builds so you can't enjoy every angle of it.

Oh, forgot to mention your ""dialogue choices"" all turn out the same 94% of the game so the entire ""replayability"" factor was yet another smokescreen to get your worthless petrodollars. I wouldn't even waste stimulus checks on this chit. It's worth less than toilet paper. All of this waiting for the biggest disappointment in gaming industry history. 

Staff should be ashamed of this garbage pixel-lumping trash heap. So many promises that weren't kept. What a fukking joke dude. P!ss off into a ladyboi's mouth."
1609552770,Best open world RPG i've played in a long time. loved every min of it.

1609552743,"fun game yes there are some bugs but those will be gone soon hopefully, only had couple visual ones and 1 during a mission but nothing to bad, still fun."
1609552683,"It's pretty buggy but if that's not something that bothers you and you can look past it, the story and RPG elements are great"
1609552681,"I honestly bought the game expecting a lot worse glitches than what i actually experienced. The way everyone made it out to seem made it sound like the game was unplayable. However, I really enjoyed the game. Yeah some of the glitches can be annoying, but with how fun the game is, they're easy to ignore. This game really quenched a thirst I've been having for a really long time. It's like GTA 5, Fallout, and Altered Carbon (the netflix series) had a baby and this gem popped out. 9/10 would recommend"
1609552672,Absolutely FILLED with bugs after THREE release delays. No valid excuse for this.

1609552131,"Thank you CD Projeckt RED.
Thank you for a masterpiece of a game. 

I absolutely loved this game. The story, the setting, the characters, the gameplay, the progression, all of it was perfect. I was hooked at every moment. I felt immersed in the world of Night City, like I was living as V. The tension as the story progressed, was something that I felt at every step. The weight of your actions, and your choices was something that made me think, and overthink every decision I had to make.
The characters were amazingly developed, with each having distinct, and fleshed out personality, that made you personally invest in each one of them, at a deep level (especially romance options: Panam best girl). 
The satisfaction of slowly becoming a legend of Night City, was like no other. Progressing to a point where you become a demon with the Emperor's katana (Satori: DO NOT MISS THIS IN KONPEKI PLAZA AT THE BEGINNING), where everyone falls at your feet, was an immersive power trip to say the very least. 

Yeah sure, there were some bugs, none game-breaking for me, and only immersion-breaking at best. It is a shame that this game released in this imperfect state, but I love it none the less. 

Using an RTX 3070, and a Ryzen 5 3600, at RT Ultra settings, the game ran ok. It's not exactly what I'd call optimised, but it was more than playable, and it looked absolutely gorgeous. Without a doubt the best looking Video game in video game history. If you can play with RT with acceptable performance, then do it. It's not worth the, say 100+ fps or whatever, because you will, without a doubt, be missing out. 

Thank you again CD Projekt RED. It's clear that all of you devs loved this game, and really want us to love it too."

"
1609552100,.
1609552074,"After playing 40 hours of this game and playing it too completion I can say this game is worth the 60 euro. 
First off im talking about the PC version not the console version so what I say could be different with the console versions and also note that when I complain about bugs please keep in mind that they could patch them out.
Lets start with the bugs. This game has alot of bugs but its not as buggy as some people make it out to be. I encountered no crashes in my 40 hours which is actually suprising  considering the bugs. Bugs are frequent but minor. The worst one is when I quit out of the game and it was still running in the background so I had to turn it off through task manager and there was also one where I had to restart a checkpoint thanks too characters not doing what theyre supposed to do. I mean people are acting like its the buggiest game ever made which is bullshit. Id like to remind those peole about Fallut 76, Black ops 4, Far Cry 5 and Anthem. Even months after launch those games where still broken messes. The gunplay feels solid and way better than what it looked from the trailers. The stealth is suprisingly good. The open world is actually amazing especially the map which even makes GTA V look small despite it only being a bit bigger than GTA Vs map but do keep in mind Cyberpunks city is way bigger and has waymore indoor areas to explore. Keanu Reeves is also in this game as Johnny Silver Hand and hes a dick and a badass at the same time and you even get to play as him for a bit of the story. My big complaint though is Jackie whos your friend at the start of the game and after 6 hours in he dies and its sad but afterwards no one mentions him even Jackies girlfriend acts like she forgets he exists until the final mission where she briefly mentions him. Anyway the plot is that you have a chip in your head that if you dont get rid off it will eventually kill you, Sounds simple? Nope! You have been shot in the head and now your mind has been put into the chip and eventually Johnny Silverhands gonna take over your body. Now you can still explore the open world without having to worry about getting mind corrupted. But the story is pretty solid and I actually like as its complex and you have a goal which lots of Open World games seem to not have. The character creator is ok and you can customize your dick but once you have created your character you cant change your hair style or beard which sucks since I kinda wanna change my Hair cut in the game and my biggest criticism is the optimization which despite the game looking really good it doesnt excuse how piss poor the optimization is. My verdict is 9.5/10 Must Buy on PC."
1609552048,It's fun. I like it. You should too.
1609552169,"Okey, so this game is absolutely fantastic. Sure it has some bugs and other things that need improving, but the quests, the music, the storytelling and the general gameplay is really good. The graphics and the ligthning is also super freaking good, espiacally if you have a good computer. Some of the sidequests is on a whole other level, I¨ve never seen such good writing in a videogame before. CDPR really is good at storytelling and know the importance of music to set a scene. Im really happy with my playthrough and I got a great ending , which actually was satisying. If you want to have a good ending (or more options to end the game) make sure to really focus on sidequests and companion quests. All in all I totally recommend this game. You might want to pick it up in februari when the first real big update arrives to have a smoother experience. I clocked 81 hours with my ending and personal playthrough and still have a lot of extra content to do.  I rate it 8/10."
1609552020,"SPOILER FREE
---------------

Even though there are some minor bugs and barley any that affect Gameplay, (Which should be patched in like a Week or Two), I strongly recommend this Game to people Who like Story, Open-World, Player Builds, Combat, etc. Also this Game is visually stunning, with the Great Details of Night City and the Areas outside of it.

9/10."
1609551971,"yes there are bugs but i take my hat off to project red. thank you, amazing game. I wasnt even a fan of the witcher 3. But im a fan of the fallout series and GTA. this game is perfect."
1609551937,Fun game but very buggy. Don't regret the purchase but overall still dissapointed.
1609576937,"I've played it a bit now and here's what I think

It's like having a second life,
I play it a few hours every day and I feel like I'm having this awesome double life.
where one personality is this person with responsibilities and that other eciting life, that is nerver boring. 
Taking place in this interesting world full of cool places and interesting personalities. 
If you can immerse yourself in it like I can, you can have what I Just described, and I hope you can!
I'll probably play It a few hundred hours and that means it's worth the money.
So for me it was a great investment,
The gameplay overall is solid (for me at least).
I hear from everyone that they're having a bugfest so you can't ignore that,
This might be a problem for the next two month or so.
So maybe wait with you purchase until it is more stable, but I'll definitely tell you to not let that prevent you from EVER playing it.
I hope you can get the experience out of it that I'm getting but I guess you have to be a specific mind for that.
But if the bugs get fixed, the gameplay is definitely solid and makes sense.
I haven't played with a controller so Idk if you'll like the gamepad but I think the keyboard controls are not the worst.
they took me a bit to get used to but they always do for me...
The stealth mechanics are great if you don't always try to look too far ahead and mark EVERY enemy but just focus on the ones you can see.
It gets really fun, There are a lot of ways you can use hacking skills that are really clever sometimes.
The skill system has 5 categories that you can invest in but there are so many and you really have to specialise and I think that's a cool mechanic.
It feels really good when you reach a specific skill you have aimed for in a specific field and then you get to use that skill and it feels good.
apart from the bugs I can't really complain about anything else but the fact that the start of the story was veery slow. It takes a long time to take off.
But it does and there are so many interesting branches happening in parallel and you can make so many important decisions.
I don't think they promised too much with the game, they just released very early which I think by today is probably industry standard... 
they fix the bugs AFTER release... all of them do..."
1609552073,"[b]Do you recommend this game?[/b] 
If there was a ~maybe button, id go with that, instead ill go with yes because no sounds too harsh for something i had fun in 

[i]Is it the best game of the year?[/i]
Definitly not.
[i]Is it the best game that came out that year that i have played?[/i] 
Absolutly. Because i havent played any other title that came out this year.

[b]Holy shit what a ride. Not the game. Everything else surrounding it.[/b]
Today i finished the main story of Cyberpunk 2077, after not touching the game for 2 weeks straight. I took my break exactly 1 mission away from the finale, and that probably ruined the flow abit, but overall the finale wasnt that insanely good anyways.

[u]Im horrible at reviewing anything, because i feel like my approach to games / anime and similar is quite different and judging something if its good is just not something i feel ready for. Therefor, have some simple ooga booga questions that i answer, and make up your own mind whether or not you will like cyberpunk or not.[/u]

[b]Q: Is Cyberpunks World and athmosphere as spectacular as everyone says? [/b]
100%. In fact, i have never seen a game (or movie) world so vast and filled with stuff. It looks incredibly good on high end settings, and probably made me enjoy the same scenery for atleast 10 hours straight even tho i drove past it countless times. 

[b]Q: Is the game as buggy as everyone complains it to be? [/b]
Yesnt. Bugs in general? Yes absolutly. Flying cars, vanishing Npcs and people stuck in a wall / floor right after cutscenes happen. Often. I find that sort of stuff funny, and i dont think i ever had to restart something or go out of my way to fix something in order to progress something. Gamebreaking Bug wise? Unsure how much you Tolerate. I died quite a few times due to something completely out of my control. Examples include Barrels randomly popping up and exploding because an enemys shot that was directed at me hits it, cars suddenly appearing infront of me and knocking me and my Bugatti Ripoff into 10 pedestrians making me a wanted criminal and sending the absolutly broken Police at me. U see, i get much more mad at myself when dying because i suck balls at something, than when the game unfairly kills me. That doesnt mean i would just forgive cyberpunk for it tho. Since the game rarely autosaves, it happens that i die to said magic barrel, and have to play through 2 minutes of dialogue again, which is just annoying and kills story pacing.

[b]Q: Is performance shit? [/b]
If your pc is, yes. I rock a RTX 2070 Super, and can play the game at ultra settings and FHD with about 90-100 fps. This was also the first time i tried ray tracing ingame. It does make the game look better, but its not worth it for me to sacrifice ~40-50 fps for shiny lights. Cool for screenshots, terrible for gameplay. I cant imagine a pc with something like a 1060 or even 1070 running this game at quality settings tho.

[b]How many hours will i get out of this game?[/b]
Highly depends on your playstyle. You can finish the main story in 20 hours or less probably, but that excludes literally everything cyberpunk is made for. Side quests, random encounters, exploring the bomb ass city. I did alot of exploring and leveling my character despite normally opting for the speedrun way in other single player games, because it invites you to it alot. 

[b]Q: Biggest flaws in your opinion?[/b]
Gameplay choices make quite alot less impact than what i expected. There are a few choices that decide uppon your future in the current playthrough, but i was expecting ALOT more of that.
Weapon scouting / Abilities are completely pointless. I have no fucking clue why i would spend the time to level up alot for some skillpoints, most of the skilltree is hella pointless. There are some skills that give you extra options ingame, but most skills are just ""increase pistol damage by x %) which is even more useless if you find some melee weapons or those mantis blades, which are so broken that you wont need any other weapons anymore. If your weapon isnt suited for your level anymore, upgrade it in the crafting menu. If that becomes to expensive after a while, im sure you found atlesat 50 alternatives that outperform your original by alot anyways, and you can begin the crafting process again. Special weapons have hardly any impact. Once you find a good sniper rifle you once shot everything with a good heady, once you get the mantis blades, you just slice everything in pieces and combat against humans becomes a joke.

[b] Would you recommend the game? [/b]
No if you are a wannabe game critic and over analyse everything in games or value quality alot.
Yes if you want to experience the coolest looking, best feeling game world in the past 10 years, or ever, and enjoy some bold shooting, killing, riding a dope car and having sex with npcs because you cant irl."

1609551046,"This game is extremely fun and has a lot of content. Anyone saying the game has 15 hours of story content obviously ran through the game as fast as they can. Took me nearly 80 hours to beat the game once (well worth $60).
The game has some performance issues but turning down some settings will help stabilize performance. I would recommend turning film grain, chromatic aberration, depth of field, and motion blur off. Turn cascaded shadow resolution to medium. And turn population density to low (this will help with performance and driving). Most of the time the performance didn't affect me much unless I was in the middle of the large cities. Outside of the large cities my performance was very stable
The game also has a few bugs but there weren't any more bugs than what I've seen in any other triple A game that has come out in the past 3 years.
In conclusion, Panam waifu. Well worth $60"
1609550910,"I play the PC version...buggy, but it's never crashed on me. Decent RPG. Not on the level of Witcher 3, but lots of fun. One of the best designed open worlds I've ever played. Fully realized, incredibly detailed."
1609550890,"Depending on what path you take, there are some game killing bugs that stop you proceeding any further.  

I'd recommend giving it a few more patches before trying to play the game through. From what I've seen so far, once it's working, it's going to be great."
1609550759,"Lots and lots of small bugs. Have to play with most if not all of your graphic settings turned down to low. Besides that, it is an enjoyable and immersive game and story. Sometimes there's to much to do."
1609550720,"Buggy at times? Sure. Needs a good graphics card to even run? Yup. Missing polish? No denying that it feels a bit rushed.

But honestly, who cares about any of that? It's a damn good Open World RPG."
1609550585,"I'm not sure if I'm a player that will be viewed as going against the grain or not but I've truly enjoyed my time in Night City. 

The only bug I have experienced thus far has been VERY minor t-posing and that's it. I know I'm not very far into the game as I like to take my time and explore with side quests. It has been extremely fun. The character designs are unique and fun. I feel like my choices matter and I feel a weight when I answer conversation pieces which is a nice change from other RPGs that promise this same effect. I definitely think it's worth a buy if you're even slightly interested in it. I don't think it's nearly as bug infested as people have claimed.

Enjoy Night City!"
1609550563,Very fun. Lots of open world exploration and plenty of character customization. Would have liked to have seen some vehicle customization as well but oh well this is not forza. Excited to see what they add to it in the future.
1609550524,"I recommend this game.....with some hesitations, it's buggy, might take you out of the game when set to low or medium settings. There's a lot of flaws in this game, but i find myself really enjoying my time despite the flaws. honestly probably give this a 6 or a 7, 8 at best. I spent 52 hour already and i still don't want to stop."
1609550493,"I've put over 200 hours into this game since it released, and played through it twice. I love it, jank and all. Nothing wrong with it won't be fixed, the story and world are just incredible. Definitely play it."
1609550467,Despite the Bugs Ive Aboslutely loved this game
1609550353,"The game is great. The story is good, the game play fun. Not much else to say on the matter"
1609550345,"Are there some bugs? sure. But for me, none of them are game breaking. This is overall a fun and memorable game to play and something worth visiting and replaying time and time again"
1609550329,Its cool
1609550250,"A master piece of a game. Played it for 124 hours. I loved all the side quests (be sure to play them first). People need to stop crying about glitches (all games have glitches). I really loved everything about this game. I hope they come out with some expansion packs for it. This is one of those games that once you beat it, you get up from your desk feeling like a different person. It changes you and I love that."
1609550186,"Story is not a grand epic adventure but about a personal struggle, desires to make a name for yourself while fighting to not let the circumstance swallows you whole. You build deep connections with the characters in the game which make or break your journey in Night City. The setting, music and atmosphere are magnificent, very unique and immersive, specially on ultrawide. Best cyberpunk game so far for me.
The game is also very buggy which can makes you laugh or rage quit depends on the type of player you are. But I have yet to encounter a game breaking bug in the main story beside one which prevents me from completing a side quest to platinum the game at the time of this review. 
The AI in this game is also not good, cars stop if there is anything slightly blocking the road. Everyone abide the traffic lights to a tee even though all kind of crimes happen everywhere in this city.

1609550074,Just wish there was more
1609550059,Is it better than the Witcher 3? No. Is it the best RPG since the Witcher 3? Yes.
1609550049,"Bought this game for the glitches, ending up finding a solid title and a lot of glitches.  Most of them are just funny though.
7/10"
1609549975,"Approach this game as if it's engine was made by Bethesda, it's graphics were made by Dice, it's gameplay by 2010's Ubisoft, and it's writing alone by CD Projekt Red. Then you just about know what to expect.

It's a gluttonous banquet of bugs ranging from minor to blatant, but I've only had 1 CTD in over an hour of playtime. Most if it is visual jargon, the game simply can't handle loading all the stuff it needs to load in the short time frame it has in most cases. Driving brings out the worst of these visual shortcomings as entire city blocks fail to render assets. Expect something to act funky or look funky at least once every 3-5 minutes of gameplay but mileage may vary.

The saving grace of the game is it's writing, which i subjectively consider to be some of the best I've seen from a AAA title within the last decade. A lot of focus and love has gone into crafting this world and it's stories, and the voice acting in most cases is fantastic. Unfortunately the voice actors for both V's run into that time honored issue of being bland and monotone in many instances due to being a vessel for the player, however there are moments where they really really shine. Honestly it feels like in V's case they wanted to have their cake and eat it to, that being having a empty vessel the player can interact with the world through AND having an interesting, deep protagonist I.E. Geralt to get invested in. The result is unfortunately underwhelming and falls short in both aspects, but lucky the people you will meet and interact it with mostly avoid this pitfall, and prove to be vastly and endlessly interesting to talk to and interact with.

Gameplay is good, sometimes great, sometimes terrible. Hard difficulty is a mess, often making wild, unpredictable jumps in challenge as it tries to scale the AI, only to have it cosistantly land at the two extremes of ""Inept and Useless"" or ""God-Like with Cheats Enabled"". Above normal you can expect to end up in some fights where enemies will simply obliterate you if you don't follow a very specific playstyle, which really sucks. Normal is in most cases too easy, with one op weapon or ability making the entire game laughably easy. I stumbled upon legendary mantis blades about an hour into Act 1 on my second playthrough and I can annihilate skull level enemies in seconds with them. If you plan to play the hardest difficulty or want to feel like an absolute god of Night City, spec in Intelligence and Stealth, then quick hack and Daemon your way through the entire game. Just slip into the enemies cams and make an entire gang commit suicide one by one through a variety of entertaining ways, all while you sit in the back alley laughing and drinking some synth-coffee. Tech weapons are underutilized in the Tech tree, and Smart Weapons are ignored almost entirely aside from a single perk in said Tech Tree. Meanwhile weapons like Blades and Pistols get a huge range of bonus perks that make them stupidly powerful in the late game. Not that I'm complaining, cause popping five heads with a power revolver in quick succession feels damn good. That said, expect to be mostly herded into 1-3 weapon types per character, as unspecced weapons have a nasty tendancy to HEFTILY under-perform. Shotguns got hit the worst, they simply don't have the sort of weight and effect that is needed to make them feel good, unless stun locking someone with one then pumping a full clips worth of buckshot into them until they get back up with 5% while you reload sounds like your thing. 

The Open World is fantastic. Night City is stunning [When it's working] and I've completely fallen in love with it. My personal advice would be to never quick-travel. This is the kinda game you benefit from letting yourself really get lost in it's setting and tone. Cyberpunk 2077 has a vibe that is unmatched even by the criminally small pool of games in it's genre. Night City is a beast, a genuine presence of malice that you feel through every neon-drenched city block and trash-covered povertous street. It's verticality is astronomical and i don't think i've even seen 20% of what this place is hiding from me. Unfortunately the main story and most main sidequests kind of shepard you to about three specific regions and painfully neglect the others. Rancho Coronado sound fun? Well you better go there on your own initiative cause the game sure as hell won't give you a tour. Find Watson the more dull, generic sector of NC? Well too bad cause about 50% of everything big in this story happens there, with an occassional jaunt over to a small corner of Westbrook. Regardless, this is a world you WANT to explore.

I mean, you will have to explore the city if you want to make any money. The economy in this game is... strangely over-realistic and not in the good way. You make pennys off most contracts, and buying anything will be dragging hours worth of income right out of your bank. I hope you aren't a car buff, cause you'll be lucky to buy one, maybe two vehicles in this game out of your own purse. If you want more you're going to have to bypass all that vital and badass cyberware you saw at the clinic cause it's gonna cost you MORE than an arm and a leg, literally. You should never BUY guns or clothing, it's a waste of money, and the crafting system is somehow both completely busted and absolutely useless at the same time, allowing for easy cheesing to upgrade weapons but making components to MAKE anything ridiculously difficult to find and impossible to afford. Oh, and don't expect vanity slots, cause you ain't getting any. You WILL look like a homeless clown through vast swathes of the game if you want to have any meaningful armor count, unless the RNG gods are in your favor and give you some cool, slick arasaka military gear or a sweet set of merc clothes over say, a bright neon yellow plastic raincoat, a purple zebra rice hat with a plastic fan attached to it, some pink leopard booty shorts, and some snakeskin cowbow boots. Now that's fashion baby.

I'm skipping over a lot of stuff i both love and hate about the game but I don't want to be here for all eternity and I doubt you do either. The question at the end of the day is: Is it worth it? Well, for me it was, but im incredibly biased towards this genre and this level of writing prowess. I can look past the issues and still find endless enjoyment in the messy carcass that is Cyberpunk 2077. I have full faith that CDPR will fix this game and improve it, but as of now, in the launch state it's currently in, unless you are a huge buff or have a VERY high tolerance for immersion obliterating bugs every vivisec, I suggest waiting, either for a sale or for the game to find itself in a better state of being. 

I'm going to keep playing it and loving it, while simultaneously lamenting all that could have been. There's a masterpiece here somewhere, it's a shame we didn't get it at launch. Maybe in the near future.

Stay safe out there Chooms. 

"
1609549906,"at 69 hrs of gameplay, all I can say is NICEEE. rating 69.9/10"
1609549863,"You all heard of the bugs. But I personally had barely bugs and none gamebraking.

I must say prior to my Review that I played on a 1060 (3080 still not available :( ) with an 1440p monitor which caused me playing on lowest setting with about 30 frames. This came pretty close to the console experience so I heard but the Story absolutely kept me going. I loved the characters and dialogs. The Ending left me craving for more and sidequest are enjoyable. Although it felt a bit repetitive sometimes when you have to battle the 20th Cyberpsycho.

All in All absolutely recommend playing it! But It is the new crysis so check hardware requirements first :D"
1609549784,Not half bad.

1609549572,mixes alot of genres i like into one
1609549528,great fun
1609549474,on PC this game is a lot of fun despite it's sometimes wonky glitches like floating boxes or chop sticks
1609549458,gud game god for monkeys amazing ending
1609549396,"In time the game will be smoothed out but as it stands now, it is very much playable.
This feels like a blend of fallout meets skyrim meet gta. Im finding myself infatuated with this game. I love the stories from the main story lines to all the side jobs and gigs. Lots of depth to discover and a lot of customization for your own feel and play styles.

I waited until a few patches hit before playing and yes, there are still bugs and yes it will require you to restart the game a few times if you do long haul sessions of play but I can overlook the bugs that are occurring now. Much better than it was at release from just my standpoint.

Dont get sucked into the bad mouthing of this game. Even Witch 3 was buggy when it released. CDRed will fix this up and as it stands it is very playable and enjoyable.

Still need optimization help. I run a 2070 using ultra RTX and super performance DLSS and average about 70-80 fps(Aorus Z490 Master, 32GB memory and on a NVME ssd). It can get down to the 50's at some points but the game is beautiful.

The game is so deep and the dialog is great. Really well done there. Dialogue is so deep with the options and how it affects the storylines.

I pulled 60hrs of gameplay in a week and I wont look back. Not fanboy'ing here. There ARE bugs. I can overlook them. No bugs that stop you from proceeding.

If you can overlook these bugs and play the game then definitely buy this game. Dont listen to the bandwagon of bug haters, the game is great and the story and depth of customization is really refreshing and keeps you addicted.

8.9/10 but I'll go to a 9.5 when the bugs are ironed out."
1609549358,"Pretty good game over all, some buggyness, cars are un-drive-able (you need to use bikes to have any control). I like it, I would like some better driving and character customization after a character is made, but it is still good overall."
1609549305,"PLAY THE FUCKING GAME
"
1609549298,"I'm writing this review after clearing all the map, all side quests and one of the main story paths, on PC.

Yes, there are bugs here and there. And there's a strong feeling certain aspects were not finished or  left out. But nevertheless it is a good game, well worth it's price and your time.

This game feels weird to evaluate cause i""m not sure what to compare it to. It feels like a blend of an open-world RPG like The Witcher 3 and GTA. I guess the devs tried to combine everything, but ended up having a product that's worse than both in their respective genres.
Giving the devs half a year more would also do this game world of good. The bar was set too high.

Some short remarks on various aspects:
- Good (but not great) story. Some side quests make you think, or leave a mark as well. But you rarely have to make a decision though, and when you do it's mostly flavor with no meaningful consequences.
- Progression, skills and builds are well differentiated, I totally see myself doing a second playthrough with totally different approach. Some skills are almost useless though. Plus, in the second part of the game player becomes quite OP, at least in gun build.
- Combat feels relatively good. Gun fights are fun, there's enough feedback and it feels rewarding. Melee is slightly worse.
- Graphics is great. Good RTX showcase, but requires at least high-level Turing card to operate.
- Bugs are mostly cosmetic. Some do affect immersion, but don't happen too often. 
- Vehicles have distinct handling characteristics  and looks, so everyone will probably find something suitable. Some are genuinely fun to drive. But it's not GTA level, far from it. Braking is terrible on almost all of the cars though, for unknown reason.
- Sound is great in all departments.

Will come back for a second go once DLCs are released."
1609549226,"Despite its flaws, its a masterpiece of next gen gaming, from the story to the side quest, there is plenty to find in this game. The weapons are fun and the voice acting is spot on. I love it."
1609549209,"Best AAA game I've played in a long time, unlike consoles we finally have the better end of the straw, yes it has some bugs but nothing game breaking so far. Great history, music, VA, and nice replay value (already in my 3rd playthrough)
Let's hope the devs/modders improve it in the future. 
Also the city design is amazing. 

"
1609549199,"[Spoiler free]
132 hours, all endings, all gigs, all side stories. Got as much out of it as I possibly could and enjoyed every minute. I was hyped and it mostly met my expectations but I never expected it to be the second coming of christ like most wanted. I expected a big, cyberpunk themed open world RPG and I got it. Yes, it is an RPG. No, there's nothing massively new here, nothing that breaks the mould. In some ways, in feels like CDPR has gone backwards from The Witcher 3, but they gave themselves a very high bar and it is still better than most stuff that comes out. If you are into the Cyberpunk theme/open world games then you'll enjoy it. 

Pros:
+ great soundtrack
+ lore is interesting. Story hooked me in
+ night city is huge and fun to explore. Contrary to what others keep saying, I think it feels very alive. If it feels empty, check your crowd density settings. It was never empty to me
+ memorable characters
+ good replayability - I want to start again with a full netrunner build (I did melee this time)
+ personally I enjoyed the levelling up system as well as the gear/mods
+ load times are some of the best I've had in any game (on SSD ofc)
+ great voice acting (particularly female V - Cherami Leigh is one of my faves).

Cons:
- choices don't really matter. Not like they did in W3 anyway. There are multiple endings but you can decide in one cutscene which of those paths you want to go down - it doesn't go off your past choices (much, anyway)
- all romances apart from one (Panam) are poor, imo. River and Kerry feel tacked on just to say there's more options, their story line is very small and the romance aspect is rushed. I played as female V and felt so underwhelmed with River and Judy as romance options
- main story is very short. One of the shortest I've ever played actually. The game is well fleshed out, and there are side stories that link directly to the main story but the actual main story path is short and the ""point of no return"" approaches quick quickly. CDPR always said it was going to be shorter than Witcher 3 which makes sense because W3 main story is LONG (still great), but they've gone from long to far too short. It is my main criticism
- Bugs...I guess? I experienced minimal bugs but, sure, there were some. None game breaking. The kind of amount I have come to expect on new releases (no excuse, some obvious ones were missed and it is just embarrassing)
- I will agree that simple things like changing your appearance in game seem so obvious yet they weren't included. Probs will be added but a small thing that would have been nice

For reference I played with an R9 380, on medium, and was averaging around 35 fps. It was perfectly playable. No performance issues like crashing or freezing at all.

Don't buy into the wave of negativity surrounding this game. Get it and make your own mind up."
1609549095,fun the seeing trees through walls is the only glitch i have had with 20 hours playtime worth the money i am excited to keep playing.

1609548924,"Dope game, excellent"
1609548801,"Fantastic story, shooting is a little iffy, but not unplayable. What makes the game unplayable, however, is the insane amount of (actual game breaking) bugs. Not as bad as consoles however, but still unacceptable."
1609548779,"It's not as good as I hoped it would be, but that by no metric makes it a bad game. There are a ton of bugs, but nothing really game breaking. I hope in future patches they squash the bugs and flesh out some of the more lackluster features of the game. Until then its just good."

1609548455,Great game. Was buggy on launch but most of the big issues are fixed now. The scontent of the game is quality shit though.

I have played both the ps4(base) and PC version and the PC is superior but it still has bugs. For me personally the story and game play keeps me playing but my recommendation is wait until spring or summer 2021, the game will be in a better state. Or if you can over look the bugs (mostly graphical in my experience) wait for the first two patch coming early 2021. Honestly, the way this game was release (ESP on console) is sad, but I have other more important thing to stress and be mad about then this.. Hope this helps"
1609548357,"Okay so first thing's first:
If you expected this game to be the second coming of christ and the greatest thing ever, don't buy it.  Please, just don't.  I really don't need to hear you complaining about the game not being perfect.  And honestly, this may sound a little weird to say since I'm leaving the game a negative review right now, but just hear me out.

--The actual Review--

So, what's good about this game?  There's a lot of things really.  The story has made me cry multiple times, the game looks gorgeous, the gunplay is satisfying, the world is rich, and Keanu Reeves is in it.  However, most of this only really applies if you have a NASA computer.  I've got a top of the line rig (2080 SUPER, 16 gigs of ram, Intel I7-9700) and even then the game still lags at medium settings.  And not to mention the bugs.  God, the amount of times people have teleported around and my game has crashed at random times really kills the immersion.  So that's my first complaint, poor optimization and the bugs run rampant.  And, sadly, these two problems aren't the only issues with the game.

The AI is terrible.  I used to deny this fact, but honestly taking another look at it I find this to be the case.  The enemies are laughably easy to dispatch of because of their delayed reactions and poor decisions and the civilians around you... well, they aren't much better.  To put it bluntly, they don't really do anything.  They occasionally fade into existence around you and talk about their lives, but the former occurs much more often than the latter.  And then they don't do anything at all.  If you start shooting they just run and duck for cover, and then they remain like that for a while.  Until you go into a different area and skip some time, they are just stuck there, crouching in fear for eternity.  It's a little disappointing to say the least.  The police, too, have a bad AI.  I would lump this in with the enemies, but I feel like they deserve their own mention.  When you commit heinous acts and/or minor offenses that get the police's attention for some reason, you gain wanted levels like you would in GTA.  However, instead of driving to you and actively chasing you like you'd see in some cool cop flick, officers just kind of teleport into existence around you.  Then, once you kill 4 or 5 of them or drive into a different neighborhood, the police just stop caring about you.  There's no real benefit at all to shooting civilians, which is really the only way you can reliably get them to call the cops on you, so the only reason you'd even want to get the cops to chase you is to get some kind of adrenaline rush from the high-speed chase.  There is no high-speed chase, though.  The cops don't care.

Lastly, my final complaint is with the customization.  This may some really minor, yeah, and a little dumb.  But just hear me out.  We were promised extensive customization as one of the core tenets of the game.  And it would fit in greatly with the theme: ""In Night City, you can be anything"".  That kinda thing.  The sad truth, though, is that the customization is severely lacking.  From the very start of the game when you create your character your options are pretty limited on what you can do.  Honestly, in comparison, I think Fallout 4 has a more extensive character customization.  And even then, what's worse is that after the game starts you can't change your character at all.  And just a small complaint, you can't choose what pronouns you want to be referred to as.  It's based on your voice, and I feel like that's kinda stupid.  I feel they should be separate options, but moving on to my next grievance: once in the game, customizing your gear is just... not there.  You can't change the way your armor or weapons look, the modifications you CAN make to them are either super underwhelming or incredibly overpowered, and honestly a lot of the good gear you end up getting looks like shit, so you are faced with the devastating choice: look trash or have good stats.  It's just... very bland.

So, in conclusion here is what you want to know: if you decided to skip my entire spiel above, you get a cookie.  I said this earlier, but if you were expecting this game to be the messiah: don't buy it.  If you want a good RPG experience but don't have a NASA quantum-computer hooked up to the brain of Albert Einstein: don't buy it.  Though I do enjoy the game, in it's current state i honestly can't really recommend it to anyone.  I do sincerely hope that the developers at CDPR continue to work on and fix the game, because I'd love to see it in a polished state and I know CP2077 has a lot of potential.  But until then, I am going to have to leave a negative review."
1609548339,"Once I got the graphics settings worked out to deliver a stable frame rate, the game was quite good, and I got addicted to maxing out my character gear. Buggy at times but did not ruin the experience."
1609548276,"
great game as advertised, however i would recommend waiting to buy it later on when they fix the bugs and glitches on this game."
1609548230,"Thoroughly enjoyed the playthrough, bugs and all."
1609548188,"Game is good. Really good. It's buggy, and unfinished in many respects. But at the 49h mark, I've certainly got my moneys' worth and then some. Plot is good, draws you in. Combat is enjoyable while being fairly simplistic as far as shooters go, but all tied together is a really fantastic buggy mess of a game. 

Who knows: In the future it'll get better, and hopefully more fleshed out."
1609548169,very good story and characters might wait for more patches if you dont have a super powerful pc
1609548153,So into world and story didn't even payed attention to bugs. This game rocks!
1609548103,"Story was stellar and kept me going on this wild ride of Cyberpunk, with loops and bumps of bugs and glitches that I ran into while playing that made me question myself why I even bother continuing.
Falling through the map, floating objects, dying because I tripped on a corpse in wrong angle. Simply googling them gives you a rough idea on how and where this game has problems.
But the game and story IS fun. Its a bumpy ride but an enjoyable one nonetheless.
Does this mean this game is worth full 60? Depends, whether you can power through all the bugs and possibly immersion breaking glitches that occurs every few minutes.
I honestly don't wanna tell anyone to get this at full price at the moment, but when all the grime and edges are trimmed off, I honestly think it is an experience worth taking in."
1609548045,Just be aware some bugs but only cause the devs were rushed by the fans! love the game!
1609547935,Some moderately annoying bugs that could be resolved by restarting the game. Story had best writing I have ever seen in a video game.
1609547890,"Game is a buggy mess sometimes, but I fucking love it."
1609547781,Ignore the haters. This game is awesome.
1609547704,"I've taken the risk buying the game 2 days ago, aware but ignoring an ocean of negative reviews and comments about stability issues. I have been playing continuously for 14 hours @1080p ultra settings with a reasonable avg framerate 57fps without any crash, freeze, lost of saved games or any other related problems.

Yes. There are few bugs but nothing terrible enough to judge the creators in that awful way.

Great Job guys!"
1609547698,It's fuggin awesome!
1609547660,"I would WAIT to buy this game, as I DO NOT RECOMMEND it in its current state. 

The story is fleshed and a pleasure to play out, characters are likeable and you have incentive to further explore their narrative and backstories. The world is beautiful and sucked me almost immediately. However, this game is beautiful to explore and fun to play around in, but after you finally get into the groove of things, you realize that there isnt much incentive to play the game any further, and this is only exacerbated with the bugs, poor, poor opitmization, broken and terrible AI, boring and broken wanted system, spawn points are broken, limited customization, and overall non-polished and rushed feel this game presents. As soon as I get intertwined and sucked into the story, I immediatly get taken out with bugs, broken saves, and insane lag I get. I am running a 10700k and a 1080ti on 1440p, and I can barely scrape by 60 fps on low settings with insane fps jumps. But, if you can ignore these issues and continue to play the game, the glitches and bugs mentioned earlier will most certainly will.

As for the predatory and misleading marketing, its exploitive and gross to say the least. I had a lot of faith in CDPR to release a polished experience, with this certainly not being it. So much rush and crunch pushed on by management lead to numerous features that were said to be in the game to be completely scrapped. It such a shame, this game could of been the new standard for games all over, and now its just a testiment to greed and why pre-orders suck. Ill give CDPR a second chance, but they are going to have to do a lot to restore good faith with their fanbase and costumers. 

With that being said, this game still has a lot to offer story wise, as it is fantastic and well written. Johnny Silverhand is an excellent character, same with kerry, panam, and jackie. It is the best part of this game by a long shot. But, there isnt much incentive to play the game again as the life-paths dont matter at all besides some very vague and not very important dialogue changes that, sadly, dont change anything at all story wise. Crafting is useless and way too expensive, and due to the 8mb save file size limit, dont craft or dissasamble too much or your save will be corrupted and useless. 

As for the combat, Its okay. The gun play is fun, but there is almost no weapon variety and most of them are reskins anyways. Power weapons, smart weapons, and tech weapons, make basically zero diffence and feel no different at all. Some weapons have some status effects, but most are just reskins with a percentage change to stats. Fist fighting is terrible, clunky, and useless. To be fair, all cyberware is literally just a percantage boost to stats anyways. 

In conclusion, this games story is great, characters are well fleshed out, and have interesting side missions, but is marred by bugs, terrible AI, boring and broken police system, poor optimization, and lack of customizbilty and weapon reskins. 

Id wait for a sale, or if you really want to play the story and dont expect much for replayabilty.

1609547620,"Running a 3090, i7 8700k clocked at 5g, 970 evo plus and I couldn't wait for this game. 

This game sucks. I wish I could refund. 

It's boring, has no real intro, is lacking in every aspect I can think of for an open world FPS and frankly is early beta at this point. I tried liking the game and even found a GTA Grove Street easter egg that I thought was cool but man this game is so buggy and un-immersive that I can't play it.

I was REALLY hoping CP2077 would be the first fully interactive city in an open world game lol.




"
1609547495,"I had my expectations straight from the start, I knew the product would be buggy, so I got no issues with that. This game is nice, it needs work though, so if you're a fan of this universe you will not regret buying it. Had a lot of fun with the quests, the random encounters and the city as a whole."
1609547388,"I got this game like a week or 2 after release so most of the major bugs were fixed and the story is good so is the gameplay its just doing missions loud is a little boring and on the higher dificulties your gonna be healing alot
"
1609547362,"To be brief, i enjoy this game. On PC its a lot of fun. Mind you, it is missing a lot of the promised features that many of us were expecting, but what is here is still a pretty good game, well worth a play. For a full review, check out the video below where i break down each part of the game item by item. https://youtu.be/zxWbhc5GlN4
"
1609547356,"The game is buggy...  BUT its fun.  This game is NOT GTA5 so if you are considering of buying because you want the next GTA5 THIS is NOT it.  This is an RPG shooting game, kinda more like Fallout feeling on it.  Except instead of a wasteland you are in a city.  It kinda feels more like Fallout + GTA5 combined in a way.  I have play 34hours and im not even half way done.  There are too many side quest.  Again the game is a bit buggy but they have been patching it.  It is fun right now and I am sure it will get better once they are done with patched and when they add the DLC.  My pc specs: Ryzen 3 (3200g) 16GB Ram RX 570 8GB and 1TB SSD MX500.  Game runs at 30-40 FPS on medium setting and 20-25 with High settings.  Regardless the graphics look amazing with mediums settings.  I'm sure a patch will fix the fps issue later on."
1609547328,"I enjoyed this game very much, despite of bugs now and then and some missing content."
1609547271,"Despite many things being scrapped, and the occasional bugs (I know however bugs depend somewhat on system/PC specs, so it may be different for everyone) I found myself enjoying the game quite a bit. What surprised me the most was how fast paced the combat gets, based on earlier trailers it seemed much slower. Pleasantly surprised."
1609560816,"This really should be considered ""early access"" as even the PC version still has many game breaking bugs. Furthermore the amount of promised features that were cut from the final release of the game is a joke. Call it a nitpick the fact your romantic partner choice being an ingame companion was cut was a huge disappointment . The story is amazing but I really can't recommend this in its current state, at least for anyone who considers themselves a casual gamer like me."
1609547199,Game changing game
1609547149,"I really enjoyed Witcher 3 (stories, gameplay, huge explorable map), so I decided to try out Cyberpunk 2077. I have found it just as enjoyable. The bugs can be annoying, but for me, everything else compensates."
1609547144,"Cyberpunk 2077 is a good example of what you shouldn't do to your public. Overpromising and under-delivering. Me and perhaps millions of others had invested $90 or so to get this game to see out its vision only to be met with disappointment and yet hope for the future.

Let's start with the good. Night City is a sprawling world that is really beautiful to look at. If you have a decent system like I do (Ryzen 3600 + Radeon RX 5700), then you can get lost very easily in it with all the details turned up. Characters are interesting and you do want to invest in the time or quests with them. The sounds and soundtrack do make it feel like a Blade Runner-esque world. And finally, some of the side quests are easy to get into and make you wondering what is around the next corner.

However, the bad really starts to overwhelm what little good there is. There is a lot of bugs, no joke. I've had random deaths occur out of nowhere, cars flung at me and drop out of the sky, AI T-posing at inopportune moments and as well as quests not triggering correctly. Then you get to the worst aspect of the world which is very minimal AI with AI being slow/stupid, AI cops teleporting in and as well as a lack of realism in the civilian life.

Then there's also the repetitiveness of the side quests. Go here and kill this, go there and don't kill this. Sneak in but don't kill. These are the 3 that the quests fall into and it makes little incentive to find these or do other than raising your street cred. Plus the previously mentioned bad AI, you can see how boring this becomes.

Next is the character and honestly, V is a set character despite what CDPR tries to spin. You're an asshole that does everything. Very rarely can you deviate from that. Added the god-awful inventory system and as well as no previews on clothes, you have to literally play dress up and scrap a lot. Plus a lot of good gear is 'locked' behind street cred or credits, forcing you to grind your way up. Nudity is minimal with the adult scenes being very brief or none at all. 

Overall, there is a promise of a good game but the thing is, I'm judging it as of now. And look at my 18 hours with this compared to the growing 50 hours of Bannerlord that is an Early Access and feels better than this game. I'd wait till the Game of the Year edition for this one honestly. Buying it now is like buying an Early Access that is masquerading as a full game."
1609547116,Best game of 2020
1609547048,"It's a great game but it needs some love. so many things you would find in other games of this kind are missing here and it shows it hurts cyberpunk. It needs transmogrification, better AI, and more shit to do. Don't forget to play nice with the modding community they can help you fix your shit. Overall I enjoyed playing Cyberpunk 8/10"
1609546942,"If you liked Deus Ex: Human Revolution, you'll definitely appreciate this game as it's similar but on a larger scale. I really enjoyed the game, but it's really obvious that it's rushed and doesn't meet expectations. During the game, you'll have a great time getting lost in the story and getting to know characters through side missions. I realized after doing the side quests there isn't much to do in the city which really kills the immersion; on top of that the skill tree is kinda stupid (a lot of the upgrades are just stat changes, not a lot of ability unlocks) and the combat can get stale at times (non-lethal options). If you want a game that has interesting characters, story, beautiful map, and weapons cyberpunk is for you. If you want a polished open world RPG, then this may not be your cup of tea."
1609546858,"It is visually stunning, running it on a RTX 2070 SUPER and its great. Yes there are issues with the game, bugs, glitches and seemingly unfinished aspects of the game but I personally do not feel I was cheated out of my money, it is very clear that this game will become better over time like No mans sky did and I understand that doing business that way is deceiving to the consumer as a whole but I truly believe this game has greatness in its potential to be one of the best games ever made but it does fall short of that in its current state. This is not the biggest failure in gaming, in a year it very likely will be winning labour of love awards."
1609546780,It's really good!
1609546776,"The story is bad, the gameplay is at many times buggy and not immersive, but there are so many good things about this game that if you have a high-end PC setup you should give it a try today."
1609546774,what a  waste
1609546502,"I have encountered very few bugs. Overall the game is not what I expected, but I enjoy it a lot. Very fun, interesting and appealing."
1609546495,"While there are bugs, if you enjoy games like The Elder Scrolls you are used to it.

If you enjoy cyberpunk, and your computer can handle it, its solid enough,"
1609546489,Fantastic stories with great characters. It could be better and there are minor bugs that I've experienced. Great game  nonetheless.
1609546489,"Contrived story line, garbage UI, crap dialog.  The hype-machine has no clothes this game sucks"
1609546443,"fun, lots of side missions if thats your style. didnt experience as many bugs as others are saying."
1609546370,Pretty dang good bugs and all
1609546359,You can buy better games in lower prices.
1609546250,Buggy but still a great game. Detailed interesting story that is oddly similar to the way the world is going. Fun gun play and not an over burdening inventory system. Good progression.
1609546106,"хорошая игра, ну"
1609546101,"well, from an artistic perspective this game is superb, blade runner vibes, retro futuristic cars, eye pleasing interesting characters. 3D/ 2d artist did a great job, same as sound engineers. story is good. from gameplay perspective this game does not offer something you have not seen before. Cyberpunk 2077 is still scripted branching but linear story. choices you make will take action mainly in couple of quests. A.I is practically none existent, cops spawn behind your back, there is no car chases and so on. just hop in your car, drive 400 meters and you lose wanted levels. NPC's disappear and pop in out of nowhere, as soon as scripted game sequences ends, everything just falls apart. transitions between animations are horrendous. Some of the city areas are ghost towns with couple of zombies walking around, so basically there is nothing to do.. if NPC's driving paths are blocked by your car, traffic is stopped, they won't go round because they are too stupid. After completing main story i am suffering from constant game crashes, also game is poorly optimized.. 
to summarize this game delivers:

+Good story;
+Beautiful characters and world;
+Good graphics;
+Sound design (starting from weapons sounds, ending with music);

BAD:
-No A.I;
-BUGS, BUGS and BUGS, crashes...;
-Poorly optimized;

Game was rushed, some of content was ripped out. At the moment i could not recommend buying this game, i guess it will take another 6-9 months to patch this game to a decent state. ONLY then buy this game for a full price."
1609546051,"Despite the bugginess, this is one of the better games I've played. The characters are well developed, leaving you genuinely looking forward to completing their side missions and getting to know them. It's clear to me that the developers went above and beyond to give us a single player RPG in a world dominated by fast paced shooters and as far as I'm concerned, they knocked it out of the park."
1609545918,I haven't encountered as many game breaking bugs like I've been hearing about and its been running good. Love the story
1609553006,"This game has gotten bad press. but is it good?

Yes, yes and YES
Pros
-Solid RPG(8/10)

-Kickass gunplay and combat  (8-9.5/10 depending on build and how you play)

-Gorgeous city and life like(seriously, 93 screenshots from this game alone)  (10/10)

-Outstanding perk and build system, can seriously craft your character in tons of ways, jack of all trades, master in a specifc area or two. Or a middle ground, expert(but not master) in about three areas. I went Ninja/John Wick hacker build. Much of the reason I want to do more playthrough is to just try different builds  (10/10)

-Compelling story, with ending(s) that'll make you feel. Havent had a game that made me feel for the characters and ending in slightly over a decade(yes i played the witcher 3, yes I though it too was outstanding, it didn't make me feel though, certainly made me think and ponder if I made the right decision though)  (9.6/10)

-immersive moments, whether its being angry at someone or enjoying a touching moment with a potential romance option in the badlands while ominous/ambient music plays  (9/10)

-not the deepest character creation but ambitious options. Dont want nipples? Dont have them. Wanna have a masculine body with a vagina and use female pronous? You CAN. Wanna have a feminine body, with breast(again with or without nipples), with a penis and male pronouns? You can. Or anywhere in between(even no genital) (9.7/1)0

-Extremely well animated and believable characters. the characters look like real people and have true to life expressions and facial animations (10/10)

-Johnny Silverhand (10/10)

-An amazing finale mission/arc (9/10)

-iconic weapons can be rare, epic or legendary, and the iconic weapons that arnt legendary are still really good and will last you just as long. ++

-Quick Hacking, seriously you level it up you can clear whole bases without ever firing a shot. You just walk in and *think* about people dying and they do when you upload die.exe into their brains(10/10)

CRITIQUES AND GRIPES
 
-obviously some patchwork needs to be done. But its no where NEAR as bad as bethesda games. if you've played fallout new vegas. Then you have nothing to fear

-Was hoping for a more free flow story like fallout but the story it has it by no means bad

-RNG, I did ALL the side stuff except collecting all the cars, And I finished the game with Half epic(purple) and half legendary gear(and even less epic and rare mods for things). I dont mind working for things, but come endgame I would like to be decked out in top tier gear

-Legendaries can found in the world same as fallout but they DO NOT scale to your level. So go ahead and look a guide to find all the free legendaries and get them off the back, then use them until they arnt good anymore(DISCLAIMER:YOU CAN GET LEGENDARIES FROM SHOPS AND DROPS THAT DO SCALE TO YOUR LEVEL SO DONT WORRY)

-Some legendary iconics(that is a unique legendary as opposed to any weapon that spawns as legendary) can ONLY BE ACQUIRED THROUGH CRAFTING. So if you don't go the crafting route, you will be locked out of a handful of iconic weapons. Which is absolutey dumb. I'm an SMG guy. Imagine my heart break I pick up a legendary, its an Iconic SMG. One of THEE best guns in the game. Cant use it because you pick up its blueprints and I couldnt craft legendaries(and you cant find it as a dropped weapon) 

-Clothing RNG: Make sure you learn what clothing shops sell what if you care about appearance. If you leave it to random drops your character will always ALWAYS look silly. And it WILL NOT get better. For a short while I had a cool cyberpunk-future-tactical-ninja look, then after a while it went ALL down hill. My character look ridiculous, literally an assortment of random articles of clothing that do not match. My friends have had it way worse. So constantly farm shops, if they dont have what you like, wait 24 in game hours to re-roll their inventory. 

-Clothing style, I understand the dev logic was you're some city slicker so it doesnt make sense for your character to just casually walk around in military gear or future exo-skeletons. But thats what I want. At least have more tactical style clothing options. They wanted an immersive experience so I get it but its MORE immersive breaking when you're wearing a fedora, a brassier and a reflective vest because those had the best stats

-Upgrading weapons, you can do it but only so many times. There was an AWESOME AWESOME Legendary iconic Smart SMG with fire damage I found. Couldn't carry it with me to the endgame because you find it mid-game and the game doesnt let you upgrade it enough to carry it all the way through

-More weapon attachments(grips, laser sights, thermals), currently its just optics and suppressors(but there are ""mods"" like increase crit damage so I guess it balances out, these mods DO NOT take an attachment slot and uses its own slot)

-More active cyberware. the vast majority(like 90%) of cyberware is passive upgrades. There are active, like double jump, mantis arms and whatnot. But There should be more gadget augments, like Deus ex"
1609545816,PonPonShit
1609545780,"I absolutely loved it!

Just finished my first play through. I genuinely gave a crap about all the characters (unlike GTA) and the story was compelling.

Beyond that, Night City felt alive. Everywhere you go something happens that pulls you off course and down a dark alley.

I would highly recommend.

(Yes, I had a few bugs and glitches but the gameplay was so worth those very minor frustrations.)"
1609545776,"So far so good I haven't run into any of the reported bugs yet. I'm only a few hours into it but it plays well, is interesting and fun :) I think this will be a great game once the major issues on other platforms are resolved and there is further refinement to things like the interface (could be simplified) and progression in character development is clarified. Still as I said I'm enjoying it so i give it a thumbs up.
Fink."
1609545675,gud
1609545569,It's a good game... except for shader of the distant trees burning threw other shaders and backgrounds
1609545537,"not many bugs on my 2 runs. Plenty of stuff to do. fun game, can't wait for the expansions."
1609545518,Bade game framraye low
1609545493,Wake up samurai
1609545481,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!  Have played less buggy Beta tests.  To top it off, tried to give it a decent shot at playing it and because I did I cannot get a refund.   Between the game and Steam it's enough to have me start playing console games."
1609545304,Wait until the fix it and the game goes on sale. Right now it’s not worth it.
1609545114,Worth a buy.
1609564607,"I have encountered many tolerable non-game breaking bugs that I sometimes have to make compromise with, such as random uncontrollable movement on some slope, visual glitches such as super bright/dark visibility when driving some vehicles in first person and audio glitches where character voices just doesn't play. 

But the major issues lies with my personal experiences of rolling back on saves until one allowing you to progress, seriously. Examples include key enemy teleporting outside play zone, unable to use weapons even after restarting game + reloading save files, and the old straight out crashing. And some of this happens quite often as well.

It is true the game is real immersive with engaging story, all the futuristic vehicles, neon lighting, cool city packed full of people and captivating character personalities etc. But it all counts to nothing when it just doesn't run well. Not to say it's also not graphically optimised at this stage even if you have great hardware.

I recommend not to play it now until they manage to fix it, it would truly disappoint you. It's because the story deserves to be enjoyed first time around with all the surprises and plot twist. Whereas if you buy it now at full price, you'll not only have to battle with your cyberpunk rivals, but also battle the problems that comes with the game itself."
1609545044,"The AI is completely broken and there is a mountain of missing content. I would normally be excited about the developers patching this game, but there is no patch big enough. And if you think that the shareholders and executives that pulled this game out of the womb will allow the developers to continue patching it after it is ""acceptable', you will be sorely mistaken. 

Has the bones to be a really good game, but that's it, only bones. Also incredibly short, couldn't bring myself to finish it twice now. Expected more from CDPR. Might go play Witcher 3 again."
1609544941,"Don't buy it right now, until they finish fixing the game. At this state the game is full of bugs and needs some high-end hardware to run. If you can tolerant the minor and funny bugs and got the hardware to run it then its a maybe but beware of quest breaking bugs cause there's some and i encountered one making me to reset my whole play-trough. I suggest to manual save before the mission start so you don't meet same fate as me. 

Basically it's a well written fallout game."
1609544893,"Requires BEEFY BEEFY BEEFY computer, but it has vending machines from which you can buy burritos. And that's about all I do."
1609544860,"Understandably people are angry about the performance at release, but if you look past all the bugs/glitches and focus on story and gameplay/playstyle its really a great game."
1609544833, Its a great game if most of bugs get sorted out.
1609544814,"Its an over-glorified, empty elevator shaft simulator with broken physics."
1609544803,"Too much potential. WASTED. Too much Marketing and can't deliver.
Cyberprank. Cyberbug."
1609544768,"While this game did release with some bugs, a couple were pretty major, it is still overall a great game. The story is solid so far, and I love that Keanu Reeves didn't just phone in the part of Johnny Silverhand like most actors do when doing voice over work in video games. Still worth the time to play and I am not sorry I pre-ordered it."
1609544835,"I played for 70 hours on PS5 and 20 on Steam. This game is my personal game of the year. Does it have problems? Certainly. Is the game not what was promised? Sure, the game has many missing features that needs to be added but I am hopeful that CDPR will do the right thing and turn this game into a talking point just as much as the Witcher 3 is.

On the surface we have a very detailed and beautiful open world with a cool story with some interesting story beats and some of the most relatable and lovable characters I have seen in any game that are central to very well wrote side missions that both offer nuance to the over all story Cyberpunk is trying to tell and adds color to the world around it even though at times the setting can feel bleak and noir-like."
1609544742,"Look passed the bugs, the glitches and enjoy this wonderful world and story... 



"
1609544711,amazing game!
1609544620,"This game is completly unfinished in its current state. If you wish to engage in any other content except the main missions and some side missions, you will be completly disappointed and suprised at how little this game has to offer."
1609544597,its alright
1609544578,I love this game.
1609544451,"I enjoyed playing it a lot however towards the end I experience some bug for some of my final side quests, and it dampened my experience in the end."
1609544444,Cyberpunk 2077 is the best representation of a world where greedy corporations ruin everything for other people.
1609544359,punchy
1609544347,"I like this game, it is very good."
1609544335,good
1609544254,"Without a doubt, my game of the year. I had a few bugs that broke immersion at times, but otherwise an excellent experience. Amazing characters, great story, good game play and decent performance on my PC (RTX 3080/ i9 10850K)"
1609544198,hahahahahahah sex
1609544187,"Big respect for the voice actors and the people who wrote the dialogue lines. The game is not perfect, but it's fun and it's clear that the devs really put a lot of effort into making the world immersive. The Night City is huge and vibrant, the main story characters are exceptionally well-fleshed and engaging enjoyable. Personally, I enjoy the game lot."
1609544073,Waste of money and my time
1609544006,"Kind of a hallow shell unfortunately. Love the witcher. At this time I wouldnt recommend getting this game. Just not a ton to do and the world feels pretty dead after you finish the beginning of the game, which feels like how the entire game should have felt. Really hope they take the time to program some AI into the npcs and teach cops to drive. Its like walking through someones unfinished art project, fun to look at, just like star citizen. Not mad, just disappointed."
1609543931,Wonderful world where you can get lost in a positive way!
1609543913,"Bugs will be fixed, but content that was promised wont be delivered."
1609543857,Buggy but addictive like crack.
1609543657,"Great game, lots to do, fun and great story. I would have liked to see a paragon/rogue thing included but he is a cyberPUNK after all.
Pros: graphics, voice acting, story, crafting system, combat system, vehicle driveability with mouse/keyboard, sound track, and more
Cons: no show stoppers but still plenty of glitches"
1609543625,FUN
1609543563,"Could do with some more polishing, but all the core mechanics are strong, and the story is good. Not as good as the Witcher 3 but still worth picking up. If you have lower end hardware may be worth waiting for more patches as people in that situation seem to be having more issues than those with higher end machines."
1609543484,"Great story :)
And works on Linux via Proton."
1609543429,Never had to deal with any game breaking bugs. Enjoyed (enjoying) my visit to Night City.
1609543351,"Well, they said this game would be epic... 
I'd say, it is very good, however what they made us expect and hype wasnt really in the game completely, and you know.. buggy and messy launch... that being said, i've encountered so little or not-so game crashing/breaking bugs... 
all in all... if they fix it ( ill edit my comment/review if they do ), the AI, Cops, living city, traffic and pedestrians etc... it'll be a better game...
Story is short and didnt expected it to be this short... 
7.5/10"
1609543285,"game doesn't deserve half the hate it gets, it is still a great game with the potential to get better with future updates"
1609543268,best game ever
1609543206,Works great on most modern PCs in reality. Really fun game if you ever played the Tabletop RPG..
1609543083,p og
1609543062,No issues on my end playing this game as of 50 hours.  Cops are stupid as hell in how they spawn and NPC's are just dumb.  kinda grindy but i enjoy the gunplay and story.  8/10
1609542965,"I can see how the game can be good, but it just isn't. Glitches aside, the movement in the game is a joke. I'm literally watching the AI teleport around a room in a gunfight because for some reason the game still thinks they are in cover so they have to snap back to their covered location when they crouch. On top of that, the game explains next to nothing when it needs to and spoon feeds you info when you should easily be able to figure it out yourself. It's almost like nobody tested the game out that wasn't involved and had prior knowledge of certain mechanics. This game wasn't ready to be released."
1609542879,"Had a lot of bad press, but this is a great game all the same, might be my favourite of this type since Witcher 3. If you like story driven games where you have a huge amount of freedom (Fallout 4, Witcher, Assassins Creed, Watchdogs, etc.) then this game is for you."
1609542793,I love this game.
1609542608,is good
1609542559,Honestly just so disappointing of a game. Wait for a sale or for huge updates and DLC. You will regret this purchase as I did.
1609542511,"This game absolutely has it's flaws, and it is NOT cyberpunk GTAV if that's what you're hoping for, but it is a good story from cdpr, and a good rpg with very enjoyable combat."
1609542509,good if your pc can run it.
1609542546,"After 8 years of development and 90+ hours (some in unaccounted hours in modded gameplay), the development and production of Cyberpunk 2077 is a tragic story that couples well the game’s message. As a game, I had my fair share of staying away from hype and participating in some but overall, I can only say that I have mixed feelings with the game itself. Some of these include:

Pros:
   •The story is linear yet interesting enough to keep you engaged in its roughly 20-25 hour gameplay
   •Cut scenes allow player control and dialuog helps expand the story telling
   •Gunplay and melee combat is fine at best for the story telling medium
   •Night City is beautiful if you do not look too deeply
   •The characters, at least the ones in the main story line are believable and have plausible causes
   •The world is open, and you take the story at your own pace and multiple riveting side quests
   •The soundtrack is an absolute BANGER. Every single track is worth the hype

Cons:
   •The game is buggy to hell and back. Since day one, there has been patches but existing bugs include graphical to coding and internal, game breaking bugs
   •Night City does not offer much in terms of past-time activities or “mini-games”. Overall Nighty City is flat and boring
   •The characters kind of fall off and become null after their side quests. Even romancable NPC’s are sidenotes throughout 
     the game. 
   •Driving is clunky; controls are a little funky but you can acclimate
   •As an RPG game, based off a pen-and-paper game (Cyberpunk 2020), your character options do not really affect in- 
     game outcomes. They open paths for combat or paths for scenarios at best.
   •The skill system is limited and falls short

    Cyberpunk 2077 as a game was advertised as an Open world, RPG mixed with First Person Shooting combat which would come out “When it was ready”. All in all, CD Projekt Red had issues with communication and management but as the consumer DID NOT delivery on their promise. The game is bug ridden, tons of content was cut, and even though I played at least hundred of hours, I was left wanting and sad that a potential gem was butchered before its rise to masterpiece. I enjoyed it for what the game could have been, but overall I can only give Cyberpunk 2077 a negative review until the game breaking bugs are fixed, more content is added, and the original passion and direction is somewhat realized."
1609542495,"eh waste of time.  never thoguht it would be anything major.  but io feel like i should be getting paid to play this.  its not fun.  the only playable mode is hard.  anything else and the game is ruined by the ease of it.  on hard nothign needs to be upgraded.  the ai is very bad and most of your fights are headshots on a confused ai.  This game feels like chore playing it.  the diffuculkty is not fun, the crafting is not fun, the cQc combat is cool for a short while.  this game is so dull. how can you a full future city and make it feel like a bad park.  besides this gaming being a huge upset to most.  its just not worth the time.  i feel bad for anyone that bought the game due to any positivity i showed.  i have a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that this game took so long to make.  after a point this game is nothing more than fallout and the division.  I have the hardest time just playing this game and paying attention.  its not entertaining the entire game.  i have spent a few hours playing this game and many more hours just letting it sit open and walking off from the comp.   this game isnt a let down. its just a time waster."
1609542490,"I liked; the story, the aesthetic, the characters (even Johnny)

The only thing i disliked were some of the glitches that would force me to restart the game, i have fallen through the world a couple times, there's this one glitch that messes up the lighting and makes the whole world look like it's in a coal mine. Sometimes it's really difficult to pick stuff up off the the ground, like i'm looking right at the object, i'm crouching, i'm shoving my face in it, and the option to pick it up won't appear."
1609542430,Johnny's guitar solo was so sick it crashed my game
1609542367,Great game overall
1609542350,"Cyberpunk 2077 is an awesome game. Yes, it does have a lot of bugs but non of those bugs were really gambebreaking. It has a huge open world and a fantastic story. It has TONS of side jobs. You also could just wait for a while 'till most of the bugs are fixed and then buy the game."
1609542340,"This game is great. Although slightly buggy, will be fixed in due time. The story is really rich, and combat is really fun. Visuals are amazing as well"
1609542307,"It's basically GTA... but with less functions. 

The launch bugs were pretty bad. The performance is 'meh' and I have a decent system. As you are playing you just get a feeling that either a ton of content was cut or they didn't have time to include it. 

Your choices really do not matter. Towards the end of the game you have a few choices that will change the ending story (spoiler alter: they all have the same outcome). 

There is this big illusion of being an interactive world where you choices matter. It doesn't matter if you kill people or work with them for quests. It doesn't matter which dialog options you pick..... it just doesn't matter. You want to play a game where every choice you make actually effects your game? Go play Dragon Age, Mass Effect, The Witcher 3, etc... this is NOT one of them.

One of the big hypes was the character customization - here again, IT DOES NOT MATTER. There are only a few times you actually see your character, hell even some of the customizations revert back to 'default' model ingame. Oh and once you exit the character creator, this is no way to change your characters appearance outside of clothing. That whole 'street cred being influenced by you appearance' also not a thing. NPCs don't react to you any differently based on you appearance. No one gives a shit if you are running around fully naked (oh also despite making a big deal about genital customizations, you are never actually naked ingame.... no running around shooting people with your windmilling dicks, sorry to disappoint). 

It's a massive open world.. but somehow it feels empty. It's so big that its painfully obvious that so much of the cityscape was copy pasta. I lost count how many times I ran by the same fucking sex shop throughout the city. Which is another weird af thing, this game throws sex in your face literally everywhere you look but you can romance 2 out of the 'one thousand unique' npcs in the game, there are also apparently only 2 hookers in all of night city... wut?

Then there's the absolutely horrible crafting/sell UI. It's like the devs put it in there but didn't actually want you to use it. It is so painful if you want to craft more than 1 thing.... crafting ammo is a nightmare. If you want to sell more than 1 thing to a vendor... good luck, you will be there forever and the more you sell the more lag you get. Further confirmation of this is when the devs basically called people who crafted to make money 'exploiters' when their save files became corrupted when they reached 8mb, are you kidding me?

The story wasn't bad and Keanu was amazing. There are some really pretty ingame locations. I really feel like this game would have been better off waiting another year in development and completely dropping this gen console versions from development. I don't really blame the devs, their marketing/management teams got greedy as hell."
1609542193,This game is exciting and refreshing. Expect it to be buggy and prepare to get lost in it. I do recommend
1609542183,If i need your body i'll fuck it
1609542142,"make multiplayer
"
1609542126,"After playing 33hrs (still have a lot to go) here are a few thoughts I have (in no particular order):
- It definitely has its fair share of bugs/glitches, but I haven't encountered anything that STOPS my gameplay experience. However, there are enough instances to definitely have an effect on my immersion w/n the Cyberpunk world.

- The world is BEAUTIFUL. In fact, the entire game, even at mostly lower graphical settings (bottlenecked by a 1070 Ti), is breathtaking. It definitely LOOKS like a 2020 game. With that said, the world feels simultaneously filled to them brim with encapsulating environments and unique AI persons and absolutely desolate in life because of the AI of Night City's inhabitants. I can definitely confirm that all the AI is TERRIBLE. It really makes excellent NPC AI stand out in older games, e.g.; GTA V, RDR2, etc. 

- With a game that does place significant emphasis on vehicles and vehicle play, vehicle handling is clunky, inaccurate and not fun. It's great to drive a super taxi, but not when it handles like a tank in slippery mud.

- The story and the conversations/engagements w/ the NPCs that you can converse w/ and are integral to the story is by FAR the best part of this game. I have loved every second of the story, and I am really impressed w/ the main character's development and the relationships they have w/ the other NPCs and V.

- The audio and soundtrack are also high points in my experience so far. From NPCs footsteps changing with debris on the floor and the type of terrain to the audible tapping of someones fingers on a coffee table as the fidget involuntarily during conversation really puts a smile on my face. I love the little things. 

Overall, I'd give CP2077 7/10. If it truly had the open world it promised w/ the AI we've been spoiled w/ similar large, anticipated projects before it, then it would truly be great. It's biggest fault, in my opinion, or should I say, ""red flag,"" would be the game's effect of giving me an itch to revisit other open world games, such as the ones mentioned earlier in the post. I will continue playing until I've experienced all I can in Night City, and I would recommend this game to anyone on the fence. HOWEVER, I would say, as many have already done - WAIT. I would say there is absolutely NO rush to start this experience right now. In fact, it'll probably be a much better experience either at a discount or after a few more hotfixes/patches. 
"
1609542116,Good Game
1609542099,"Amazing game! Sure, as anyone else has said, there's PLENTY of bugs, but none that I have encountered really bothered me. The story keeps me very immersed and interested. I'm playing on medium graphics settings, so maybe it's worse when you turn it up, but as far as I'm concerned this game rules. Tons of fun, tons to do. Highly recommend!

This is all in my opinion tho. Clearly not an expert lol. But yeah give it a shot for yourself instead of listening to the hate."
1609541933,Very captivating!
1609541907,very pog
1609541844,lets me live out my ultimate fantasy: having a large penis
1609541805,This game is not worth what they are asking. Have many games. This is the only one I've left a review on. Wish I didn't buy it. Maybe worth 30-40$
1609541768,"It's fun to play, sure. Most of the game is great but it sure does have bugs. Sometimes I can't shoot a weapon after a fresh load into the game, some times I can't move a body, V just won't pick them up so I have to save and reboot the game but hey, there's tits.
Background illustrations render over the top over everything sometimes but hey, there's tits. Vehicle drivers don't turn the steering wheel when they corner and I've appeared inside another person a bunch of times but hey, there's tits.
A lot of the side missions are cool, unique for the most part and can be a real challenge. You can go into a corner store and see some crazy as adult toys and so much of the Night City advertising is adult entertainment related which is a combination of creepy and amusing. It's a realistic insight into what the world could quite easily become but with extra tits to look at. This is my first play through as a Nomad, I'm enjoying it so far."
1609541702,Good Game.

1609541684,"Game has great potential in it. Wish they could fix bugs and add things, cut in a rush to release cyberpunk, back, so it will be complete. Anyways, this is still a wonderful game, which tells unbelievably great story."
1609541466,"Great story so far through the 26 hours I have played. But I can not recommend this game at this time. For the last 5 hours of game play have been a pain to play. In the last 5 hours I have played maybe 1 actual hour. The other 4 hours are me trying to play, just trying. This game has crashed more then a over modded Skyrim."
1609541345,gud game
1609541928,"10/10 - yes there are bugs but none of them are game breaking. 99% of the time you'll be fully immersed in the story and writing of all the quests, gigs, and characters which carry this game very far. Aldecaldos forever.

Let us go then, you and I,
When the evening is spread out against the sky
Like a patient etherized upon a table;
Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
The muttering retreats
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:
Streets that follow like a tedious argument
Of insidious intent
To lead you to an overwhelming question ...
Oh, do not ask, “What is it?”
Let us go and make our visit."
1609541274,no
1609541270,"This is one of my favourite games I've played. My experience on PC is pretty positive, I'm playing on a 1050 TI though so the performance isn't always the best. There were way less bugs than I expected. I actually haven't encountered many at all. I saw a T-pose twice for about a millisecond though that was pretty funny. I won't spoil too much of the story but I will talk about a sidequest and a little secret thingy. That part from Barry the cop do be hitting different. And calling a specific someone's mother after a specific heist is actually pretty touching even if I say so myself. The devs of this game did an amazing job pouring their hearts and souls into this game. It did not go unnoticed for me. I think the bad rep for this game is unfortunate but I understand where some people are coming from. I personally recommend this game a lot."
1609575700,"Overall great game. 
8/10 

Frustrating/Reacuring issues that become bothersome: 

>waypoint system/trails need polishing. A lot of unnecessary traveling especially within the cities/highway systems( 100km from obj, waypoint trail takes you 500m away just to turn around).  

>HUD needs to zoom out while traveling at high speeds 

>constant game crashes while driving, makes it almost impossible to just cruise & explore. "
1609546393,"game just broke my save literally any time i load it just crashes and I'm not starting over might just refund it.
its an okay mix of deus ex and witcher 3 but not worth the state its in and you can tell so much content was cut just to push it out the door.

Had to go back 10 saves but it works. still wouldn't recommend this game in its state pick it up a couple years down the road with any DLC it gets."
1609541117,buggy.
1609541114,The story makes up for any of the main gripes with the game. Its very good!
1609636442,"Runs smoothly with my PC, no fatal bugs, really beautiful. Hoping to see improvements in the future.

EDIT: Achievements are bugging. For example Legend of the Afterlife, in which you can not ""miss something"". 50 Street Cred -> no achievement. Couple of others bugged too."
1609540935,"Is the game perfect? No. But if you've kept your expectations in check, it's still one of the best RPGs of the last ten years with an incredible setting, great characters, and a fantastic story. Might wanna wait for some patches to get the best experience, but if you have the hardware to run it, it is an unforgettable experience."
1609540825,Not nearly as buggy as the console versions of the game. Definitely a fun time if you take it for what it is.
1609540931,"First of all, don't let the hours on my account fool you; I finished the game on Xbox Series X. Second of all, I still recommend this game despite its current state right now, it is still a great game nonetheless. Third of all, it has potentials for future multiplayer and do not miss out on the game. 

- [b]STORY:[/b] The main storyline is excellent and well-written. The best thing is the side quests. It is deep and solid. The script and dialogues are among the best out there, that they actually have their own distinct stories to tell. Therefore, the best thing I recommend is to play the game entirely with all side quests. However, the three life paths to me are nothing too special. In my experience, the differences you will get are different starting backgrounds, locations, and dialogues. I was expecting a whole different storyline with specific events since they worked on the game for 8 years (they could have made 3 games with that amount of time), but I think that was too much to ask for. Therefore, it makes the game doesn't really worth replaying since the stories are not too different.

- [b]GAMEPLAY:[/b] To me, this is the best part of the game. It truly shines as it is super fun. It has gear scores and multiple skill trees for particular playstyles. If you want to be a jumping ninja, you can use katana and running around slashing people like a maniac. If you're going to be a silent assassin like agent 47, you could rock a silenced pistol and do everything in stealth. The diversity of gears, perks, and attributes gives you great potential for different builds, which is excellent for replayability. The AI is kind of dumb sometimes, making stealth super hard. Therefore, most of the time, I find myself being Rambo, which is also faster and more convenient anyway. However, the worst part of the gameplay is the driving. Everything else is good except this. It feels like you are driving a boat on the road, and there are bumps everywhere you go. Anything you touch could flip your car. If you brake too fast, you spin like crazy. In other words, it is so bad that driving could be a nightmare. 

- [b]GRAPHICS:[/b] The graphics are the best and worst part of the game. It is good because it is beyond its time. It is merely the new Crysis for benchmark right now, and that's also why it is the worst part. Graphics are super intensive, and with not-so-good optimization, you get constant low fps on a good rig. I am currently running 1080ti, i7 8700k, and still getting around unstable 40-65fps running FULL HD with medium-high settings. Also, even when you have RTX 3090, you still struggle to play the game at 4K60FPS. Therefore, you might wanna upgrade your gears to get the best experience, and it is not what I thought it was going to be. Other than that, it looks great. It is one of the best looking open-world game out there, if not the best futuristic-looking game I have ever seen.

- [b]OPTIMIZATION:[/b] It is just okay for the most part. I think the game could do a little bit more to improve it, but it is glitchy and buggy for me at the moment, both on PC and console. The HDR feature doesn't work, which it doesn't give you true blacks at all. 

- [b]CUT CONTENT:[/b] The worst thing is that the game doesn't make me feel satisfied with what I expected. I expected it to be an EPIC game, but what I got is just like any other game, and that's not to mention bugs and glitches. It really makes me feels like I take GTA V for granted. The game has a lot of content cut and changes comparing with a few years ago. If you go back and watch the first released gameplay 2 years ago, it looked totally different. And now the whole thing changed almost to the point that you thought it was another game. Car customization is something I wish that I would be able to do in this game, but they don't have it, not even for the slightest like changing the paint job. Disappointing right? I know that they announced this before releasing the game due to some problem, but that is not the excuse that I can take. They spent 8 years on a game with this massive scale, and I expected that they should have come up with a better idea. Also, talking about massive scale, it is not as what you think. It lacks many features to make it a great open-world game like car customization, apartment customization, transmog, distinct storylines, etc. Perhaps, I was asking for too much, but that is the Cyberpunk 2077 in my imagination. I think they tried so hard to get it on the current-gen, which maybe why it failed from optimizing the game to not having promised contents. The developer's concept is a little bit ahead of our time and our technologies. You can feel that their ideas are there, but the hardware cannot do all that, so they had to cut it out to make it work on PS4 and Xbox One. But if they focus on the next-gen quality initially, we probably won't get cut content in general. But that's something we have to wait until 2077 to see. 

- [b]VERDICT:[/b] I would give it 8/10. I really love the game, but it is far from what I expected and imagined it would be. It feels empty sometimes because you expect it to be like GTA with steroids, and then you get the same thing like GTA, if not, worse than that. The game did many things great, but it failed to utilize the ideas' potential to make it better, making the game feel just like any other game on the market right now. Even though I love CD Projekt Red and their games, this game is a little bit disappointing for me.

[b]TL; DR:[/b]
Great gameplay, good story, terrible driving mechanic, bad optimization, bad HDR, multiple visual and game bugs, decent replayability, good potentials for online play in the future.

1609540687,"Not the best condition of gaming as we all know by now, but this story line is great. I run this game on Alienware, intel core i7 8th gen and I have zero crashes, very few errors besides the common bugs that needs hotfixes in coming future. A shame about this launch because this game would have made waves in the next generation of gaming. I recommend buying only if you have the software to run it, other wise dont bother you will just be dissapointed."

1609540599,noice
1609540533,The game runs well but the glitches and AI are worse than the ones present in any of the Bethesda games.
1609540512,"CDPR's management team (NOT the development team, know the difference) did my console brothers and sisters wrong with what they did at release. But the core experience of this game (on PC) is original, fun, in depth, well written and acted, and has been worth the $60+ I invested to drop into Night City. Is it perfect? No. Does it have issues and bugs? Yes. But I'm cruising along at 75 hours and climbing, and the entire experience is still everything I hoped it'd be. If my launch experience is anything to go by, this game has a bright future and will only get better as the development team continues to polish and create new content for CP2077."
1609540450,"I've played for 125 hours now on my Intel PC. Still got far to go so very good value IMO. Loving it! Get this game and have fun is my advice. Save often -  F5 - quick save. I encountered 1 bug which necessitated reloading from an older save. Other small bugs, normal for new software, will no doubt be fixed in patches to come. Great game, challenging side quests, attention to detail. Awesome music. I actually stopped, in a bar, to listen to a song. Very playable. My favourite so far was blasting along the highway on a motorbike at 150+ mph, the wrong way :D"
1609540417,"Warning, stay away from this product!

It's buggy as hell, clipping errors are many, even in the tutorial....

The praised main story lacks actual gameplay, it just throws exposition into your face.
Real gameplay will only take place in sidequests.

The game world isn't realistic, which in my case breaks the immersion.
The open world is mostly a false front which falls apart quickly, if you take the time to watch it shortly.
The vehicles control very poorly.
The gunplay is just bad. The fighting system feels clunky all the time...

Did i already mention the tons of bugs ?

This game was obviously rushed to release and is NOT properly finished. You stumble across cut features along the way, like the origin story delivers only fluff text, no consequences.
There is a lot of potential in the game, but the rushed release heavily hurts the product.
We're not talking about 1 or 2 months to polish. We're talking about at lease 1 year.

TL;DR
This game is unfinished, wait at least 1 to 1,5 years and a game of the year edition and preferably some dlcs, that put back the cut content, then you can think of buying this game. But take it on some sale, to show the developers, we're not silly and buy everything in any condition.

1609540153,"The game is essentially a computer hackers/geeks dream of the future, you unlock new hacks like skills and target enemies which is an incredible concept in a game (speaking as a computer security specialist by trade). I really love the wide variety of clothing and different styles you can unlock as well and if your graphics card is decent the game does take a pretty picture too. That being said it does have its glitches and sometimes I find myself reloading to get passed areas but this is not totally overbearing, it seems to get incrementally better and so far has not destroyed my love for the game. Definitely get this if you can!"
1609712472,"Just finished all the quests (other than some gigs and rides) and endings; throwing some thoughts here.

The Night City is massive - we are talking about a 100+ km^2 completely seamless map, maybe half of which is VERY densely packed with people, objects, vehicles, and events. The effort CDPR made to design the layout is astonishing - it's hard to even find 2 streets that look alike and walking in the city indeed feels breathtaking. Love the aesthetics of everything, and there are so many different cars and bikes. Gameplay-wise, there are distinct combat styles you can specialize in (melee, ranged, stealth, quickhacks, etc.), and any one of them can be extremely powerful after you learn the corresponding perks. 

The dialogs, interactions, and quests, main or side, are designed to be some of the most immersive ones among RPGs; several characters have their unique personalities backed up by stories/quests. Texting, phone calls, and the nonexistence of loading screens definitely contribute much to that immersion. Certainly do CDPR know how to write text messages and dialog lines - so well-written/voiced. Also, decisions made earlier in the game can affect what happens later, meaning focusing on the main questline alone and finishing it in 20-30 hrs would be much less interesting. There are several major side questlines to go for and they are just as vivid as the main one. 

That said, the game obviously gives an ""unfinished"" feeling - occasional glitches, sound and performance issues, shitty AI, messy stats calculation and display (especially the clothing mods) and so many locked doors all over the city. Really wish CDPR had more time to work on it. The cyberwares are fine; the arm mods look awesome, but I do hope there were more that could alter the appearance of other body parts. I'm also surprised that auto-piloting is not added as a feature for ordinary cars. C'mon it should be common in 2077.

So I agree with most points made in negative reviews, but the ratings should by no means be undermined by expectations. The pros clearly outshine the cons, even in the game's current form (hopefully large patches coming up can fix the problems). Love it and hate it - exactly my V's feeling towards NC. It's the worst city to live in the 2077 America, but hey, people are still coming no matter what for its endless potentials ;).

[spoiler]PS there are some ugly-ass hats and no options to hide them. Good thing is that armor mods or perks can totally make up for that and you can choose style over functionality w/o a problem.[/spoiler]"
1609539989,One of my favorite games of all time.
1609539941,awesome
1609539889,"Has ran great since the day i downloaded it, great game"
1609539885,"I went into this game without much research so I don't know what was promised before hand but the game is great and have put many hours into it. From what I can tell by all the hate I've heard of it, that is the consoles but plays great on pc so don't let that detour you from playing the game, so far any glitches I've run into are saved by a quick save and reload. 
I have confidence that the developers will continue to work on the game and make it even better like they did with witcher 3 but its still plenty fun as it is now and can't wait to see what they bring to the game( please fix the police soon though as they are a little broken atm)"
1609539884,"It would still be disappointing even without the bugs/ performance issues. The AI is worse than most games and there isn't much to do outside of missions. IF you think of it as a last generation GTA ripoff, then it's okay at best."
1609539863,I understand it has its issues currently but this game was wonderful.  I plan on giving it another go soon.
1609539777,buggy as hell
1609539743,"Although I don't recommend this game I did enjoy playing it and will continue to do so, I admit to negative bias also based on the actions of the marketing department of CDPR. In it's current state I can't recommend the game due to the amount of bugs, glitches and features that just feel unfinished. Once these bugs and glitches are ironed out then I could recommend it as a game but not as the game it has been marketed as. The unfinished features will most likely never be fixed and the game is substantially worse for it. The AI, physics, policing systems and interactivity in this so called next gen world, a world that is the most immersive and fully realised world that has ever been created, is not only equalled but in the majority of cases far out shined by games from 2000-2005 such as GTA never mind more recent games. The skill trees are incredibly shallow not presenting much in the way of incentive for different play styles with at least one skill that is effectively not even in the game any more (human shield) and almost every 'skill' is improve x type damage by x% this also leads to balance issues where enemies go from a bit bullet spongey and hard to hit due to accuracy and recoil at the beginning (like they should IMO) to feeling solid still early in the game and by mid way you can one shot everything. Although I specced heavily into assault rifles in my first play through, I could one shot everyone in the game except bosses with handguns, smgs, assault rifles, precision rifles, sniper rifles and the one shotgun I tried (this was late game but zero spec in shotgun). I appreciate balance is late in the development cycle and time was definitely a factor but surely things like skill trees and how they interact with game should be a pretty early consideration?
I have seen many comments/videos about how choice does not matter and there are no consequences in this game, having done two 100% runs of this game I can say that choice is more important than it is made out to be (by reviewers not CDPR, it is way less important than CDPR makes out), but to find this out it is not as simple as save scumming and clicking each option and then just continuing on. I have found instances where even the order of completing things in the world has had an effect on missions. Admittedly these are small differences usually if something is settled peacefully or in a firefight, whether somebody dies or not (inconsequential characters except for the ending) and different rewards. The problem is though that most things that you expect to make a difference don't, the main story is pretty much linear and the choices you make lead to consequences that are largely invisible unless you do multiple runs and look for them, even when you do find them they are generally small enough that most people won't care or the rewards are not different enough/good enough for people to play again for. However I for one appreciate the variables in the game and am sure that others although a minor segment will as well. If they had made more visible choices/consequences this aspect certainly would have appealed to the greater masses as was clearly targeted by the marketing department at CDPR. Your Cyberpunk, Your Rules. 
Graphics have been the clear priority in this game with story a very close second. Both of these are well done and with a lot of optimisation and bug fixing will eventually shine and be a great foundation for this game. Once these are fixed it will be a good game and worth a buy if you like story driven games. If they had implemented physics, AI and world interactivity even on the scale of GTA IV it probably would have made my personal game of the year. If they had exceeded the aforementioned items of GTA V and actually innovated in some places it probably be very justifiably the game of the year. Although many would still feel let down by the overhyping, deceit and in parts flat out lies from the marketing department I believe they still would of got out of this with their reputation intact and made substantially more money. It is so fitting that a game about corporate greed has cost them so much.
 As it is it feels like they tried to roll the Witcher, GTA and something like the division into one game and came up short on all accounts. There is nothing in this game that hasn't been done before and largely better somewhere else but at the end of the day will still be a good generic AAA title that has a really good story and a really nice shiny coat of paint to set it apart from the crowd. It is just such a shame that this could have been something truly special if it was given enough time and the same care and attention to the rest of the game that the graphics and story were given."
1609539741,Good game.
1609539724,I really do like this game. I've had a lot of fun playing it. Don't feel rushed by the main story line to finish it. I completed it in 37.5 hours and I felt rushed. Take your time.
1609539693,I'm disappointed
1609539659,"Sooo... I'm not sure what all the hubbub is about. :/ 

Awesome game. Get it if your system is at least mid level to today's standards or if you have the mid gen upgrades for console. Otherwise : You have only yourself to blame for your crying and hurt feelings. I'm hoping they just keep expanding this game and improving on things as it goes. There's so much for it, in so many ways. I think folks took to it as a negative, to me: this is what has opened up the development of games and their paths to those of us who actually play them and invest in them as experiences and don't get paid to do so. Professionally. Bees Knees Folks. Bees Knees. They found em. 

I'm running a Mid level rig in my opinion that I built 2 years ago and I've had absolutely ""0"" problems, glitches, issues of any kind, besides the default graphic settings that were set to Max/Ultra. Still managed to get a MASSIVE ""17"" FPS UWHDR at 1080. Krank down to Medium : 65.3 FPS.  Mint. Why? because except for RTX and DLSS, this game was really designed for Console frame rates with PC quality textures, environments and AI. It's an RPG, not a competitive FPS. What this game has brought is the foundation for most of what was promised. It's not ALL there yet, but I'm confident it will be. 

       Folks demands and expectations now are just a reflection of their own entitlement and disconnect from what is necessary and/or possible. Folks seem to have gotten caught up all over the surface and not really getting into the guts. This game is rich AF and the experience for me was/is worth every penny. This was always going to be a HEAVY game. From Cores to RAM and VRAM, whatever you got, it can eat it. 
            
                My Rig : AMD 7 2700 @3.4-4.2, 2x8GB G.Skill Trident S B-dies  @ 3400, Sapphire RX 590 Nitro+ SE, Samsung NVME 970 pro and 870 via SATA all on a x470 Prime board. With SUPER light tuning, literally the lightest OC you can do. There is a secondary RX 580 SE, but that's not for gaming OBVI. Someday folks might put it together that SLI/Crossfire is more for Development and Editing/Creation than anything else. Maybe."
1609539592,"bugs and stuff aside this is an amazing game.  Will be spending many more hours in Night City
"
1609539541,"absolutely amazing combat, little bit lacking in quality of life and customization features though. amazing story and I find johnny silverhand to be a very relatable and genuine character. vehicle physics aren't realistic enough but its better than gta 5 in terms of handling unless you're on a bike. not game of the century but still a lot of fun. with all that said though wait another month or 2 before you buy it, it still runs quite poorly but keep in mind its not the developers fault but the greedy publishers."
1609539533,Absolutely amazing if you have the right system. Exceeded my expectations in every way- despite the bugs.
1609539522,"This game is not only buggy beyond belief, the AI is the worst I've ever seen in a game. The cops can't tail you, half the characters randomly T-pose, and the cars just drive on a grid with no reaction to your driving. On top of this the amount of game breaking glitches I've encountered is truly depressing. Project Red should be ashamed for having released such trash and deserve all the hate they've received for deceiving their customers. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME."
1609539462,"Played 150 hours through GeForce Now, and worth the time. Alot of Side Jobs and Gigs add so much to the main story that they really should've just been marked Story. The game is as cold and hollow or humanist as you make it, choose well."
1609539394,"Should you buy Cyberpunk 2077?
-The short answer in my opinion is [b] Yes. [/b]

Let me start by saying I think people are too hard on this game, a lot of people I have talked about this to all give me similar responses which include having exceptions for this game to have had no bugs upon release and to run perfect, but If I am being honest I have never once purchased a game of this scale or even smaller that upon release dose not have any bugs. I wont be getting into console versions of this game, because obviously I don't play console and neither do you if your looking for it here on steam. On PC this game is playable and has small bugs from my experience but nothing ever crazy, my computer runs this game fine with the biggest negative being crashes which they already put out updates to fix a bunch of them. If you compare this game to how it looked at E3 they have made some serious improvements all around, which is far more then you could say about other games who showed at E3, this game is also doing and attempting things other games similar such as GTA did not do, it for me has crowds of people to walk through I can talk to the people, I can wonder and do whatever I want but just like other RPG's it has a story line you can follow with side quests you can choose or not choose to follow. By far this is the most aesthetically pleasing and one of a kind game out there of its own kind to try to make large strides in video games, I don't even mind the small bugs because of this, I only experience things like occasional crashes, small items disappear very rarely... This is all opinion based but compared to other games of this scale it did a lot for video games and it will only get better as they fix the issues, a lot of issues cant be tested before release that's why they collect data from crashes and such to improve.

If you want a game with no bugs or no issues, then wait a few months for them to fix everything, but tbh every game that first releases has issues or bugs. Also make sure your computer can play the game, look at the minimum requirements VS. your computer its a large game even I don't have a god PC, but after a graphics card update my PC took this game fine and I met the requirements. 

[b] PROS: [/b]
* RPG story line with side quests
...Well written story and side quests, you never feel like you are grinding a checklist.

* Well written  Characters
... Interesting character story's and unique personality's, with options for romance and dialogue that you don't see often in a lot of games from this scale.

*Presentation is immersive and believably open world
... Night city itself is very beautiful both graphics wise, but the atmosphere is dense and makes you feel like you are actually in a city, the sound tracks and lighting really make it something special. 

*The story line + actual game play
...The game had lots of aspects like stealth and gun-play which most games include, nothing too special there but you can have such a large variety of the build to fit your play style from varieties of guns or even just experimental cyber upgrades you can do or all the skill tree options to create a play-style to fit you and make the game more enjoyable. 

[b] CONS: [/b]

*Looting balance
...Not very much interesting loot where the variety of guns you find can be very unbalanced at times.

*Customization
... Character customization is still in this game however its not as customization as you would think, you do have clothes you can find and stats but it ends up with you looking like you just woke up out of bed and grabbed whatever you could find due to the fact you can make good outfits that fit together nicely but you also if you want to survive and do well game play wise you go for whatever has the highest level, I wish there was something like Destiny where you can transfer the level from one clothing item to another so you can have nice clothes upon becoming a higher level.

*Small technical issues and bugs are in this game but tbh, nothing game breaking, it varies depending on your setup from what I have seen but tbh most games have bugs when first released. 

*AI glitches and small UI optimization needed.

[b] CONCLUSION: [/b]
Cyberpunk itself games you amazing views in Night City, despite the minor patch-able flaws, its got some of the top notch immersion in games, and is absolutely made some major strides if you compare it to other open world games out there, and even includes boobies."
1609802506,"The recommendation for this may change in the near future but at the moment I cannot recommend this game. The game has a great main story and some interesting side quests with some lovely characters that you get attached too. The aesthetics for the city are great but that's about it. Ultimately some of the stories were really captivating but when it got into the nitty gritty, it was just alot of shooting,hacking,punching or sneaking everywhere over and over again. 

One of the issues I had with the game was how many of the Cyberpunk Videos they put out such as ""2077 in style"" or ""Rides of the Dark Future"" seemed to greatly overhype many of the key features in this game but ultimately fell short once it released. For apparel, you can be wearing a leather jacket and a motorcycle helmet while wearing a skirt just for the best stats. There is no point where u can change your apparel to something you might enjoy while keeping stats of an odd piece of apparel. Also for a dystopian futuristic game, its interesting to note that you cannot change your appearance whatsoever anywhere in the city. Visual Cyber enhancements and changing ones features being so prominent in this setting, you can do none of those things to yourself after you leave the character creation screen. I would hope they add a plastic surgeon or have the Robo-Doc do those features in the nearby future. It would be interesting if you could change you face in drastic ways such as fully chrome or receiving facial cybernetic enhancements similar to ones that the maelstrom gang have. 

The Lifepaths were upsetting as the beginning was pretty short and only ended up to have a montage of all the events that occurred in a time skip before you reach the same point in the story as if you chose any other lifepath without too much changes besides the occasional quip in a conversation. 

The city itself while may look aesthetically pleasing provides very little immersion when roaming through it. You will occasionally run across some gangs or ruffians on the sidewalk while driving through the city indicated by blue icons where you just do the same thing by blasting them all into the ground. But outside of that its pretty lifeless. I was hoping that there would be some interesting mini games or extracurricular activities that you can do sort of how the witcher 3 had its own card game ""Gwent"". Maybe having some functional arcades where you can play some games or possible gambling sites having the option to play poker or blackjack. They have the pachinko parlor in this game but you cant really play pachinko at all, its only in the name itself. I suppose thats my own fault for following the consistent hype of the game spanning across the years only for it to be released as a good story but overall decent AAA game. 

I was hoping for something more immersive but thats just me personally, so I would say if you have been following this game for a while, dont get it right now, wait maybe a year when hopefully more quality of life features gets added into this game and if you didnt follow the hype then maybe get it when it goes on sale."
1609539335,"As of writing of this review the game is still very much broken, so buyer beware. Still, it is a lot of fun."
1609539315,"It might still be a bit buggy, but overall is really great game"
1609539188,Keanu Hangout Simulator and Cybermancy with more more dongs than the average porno would ever care to finance. Rushed and glitchy but also very fun with enough content to keep the average shmuck happy enough for long enough to justify the cost.
1609539175,"A terribly made, unfinished game with a lot of failed promises. It should not be released, it's a disgrace.

The problems don't just lie on the bugs, the game is just poor. 

Loot system: terrible
AI: terrible
Weapon customization: terrible
Missions: all very similar, not interesting, no depth

Conclusion: probably the biggest fraud in 2020, if not of all time. It just help me realize how good the GTA games are."
1609539149,"I finished Cyberpunk a few moments ago. Guys, play it. It really is a masterpiece. It is extremely immersive and plays with your emotions like no other game. You will not regret it."
1609539011,"Very brutal and really gets to the point with 17 and older but its a great game. I reccomend it although the campain is a bit boring and long.

1609538954,it may not be as bad as the console release but you will experience game breaking bugs every couple hours. cd pr shit the bed this time
1609538872,great game bugs are not that bad people just overreacting and hey it was released 57 years early give them a break
1609538789,Good game. Fuck the whiney ass console fanboys.
1609538784,"the tops, crazy must play game!!!!!!!!! :D"
1609538607,"It is a great game with some minor flaws. The main and side stories are definitely worth playing but compared to GTAV the open world aspects are not quite as thought out. For example, if you commit a crime, police simply spawn behind you and won't chase you.

Personally, I did not encounter too many bugs and if so it was nothing game breaking. Usually saving and loading again would solve the problem."
1609538580,"As long as you have a good graphics card and cpu, I would recommend this game. I really enjoy the city and story,. I wouldn't go in expecting it to change gaming as we know it but overall its a good game that can be a lot of fun."
1609538535,"Great game, enjoyed it from start to finish. For me this has to be the best story line in a game for many years. No major bugs either running on an Alienware-51m, I7-9700, RTX-2070.

"
1609538455,"Buggy missions, buggy physics, buggy textures, basically buggy everything. If anyone had remotely half ass play-tested this game they would have known it was not ready for release by any shape of the imaginationm"
1609538433,"i Havent encountered any bugs yet, highly recommended so far...."
1609538393,Lots of bugs but most do not ruin the game.  Still an enjoyable experience overall.  Hopefully major bugs will get patched out.
1609538384,Unfinished release but it's still a great game overall.
1609538289,"Honestly, this game is a banger 

The games story is really well made in goes in depth about almost everything there is a quite a bit to do in the game. Loads of sides quests and Gigs crap ton of cars to buy, Insane amount of iconic weapons.

Besides the content the game is full of bugs. I like bugs and exploits in increases the amount of interest I have in the game. A lot of my enjoyment came from the graphical issues and the Stupidly fun AI.

If your going into the game for story and immersion Wait it out, due to the pressure the community put on the company the game was released early which had a lot of the content and animation cut since, from the looks of it, they completely changed the UI compared to the gameplay the was shown.

If your going into the game to mess around and not take it to seriously, get the game, there are loads of items to find lots of content to mess with."
1609538220,"This game is amazing. The level of detail and the immersive world, however those things are incomplete and needs a ton of work. Most NPCs mouths do not even move when they are talking to you. Cars will spawn after leaving a building interior ontop of each other, the face bug is present at times, also lag is a issue while walking around the town during the day.
I own a proper gaming tower, the lag is a performance problem in the game. However despite all these problems, the game is still fun, I would not refund it, I keep going back for more."
1609538109,"poggers
"
1609538076,"Very good, few graphical issues and some issues where npc mouths stop moving while talking but nothing worse than those. Bugs getting fixed every week and it has been fun so far."
1609538058,"Sure its buggy, and it plays a little wonky, but that doesnt stop this game from being excellent. I havent played an RPG this big that wasnt riddled with game breaking bugs nor did I get upset if they even performed the way they did. Great games take a lot of time to develop, it took Bethesda 5 years to make Skyrim coming from Oblivion and that game isnt nearly the behemoth of content Cyberpunk is. The ability to immerse the player in its universes while providing a entertaining experience is what CDPR did for me with this game and I couldnt have asked for more honestly."
1609538043,plays like an above average crowdfunded indie game. 11/10
1609538013,There is some fun to be had but either wait for a discount or the inevitable cyberpunk 2 which will hopefully be much better than what we got.
1609538000,zero chance life would be like this in 2077 xD
1609537922,If you have a system that can handle it and you don't mind the occasional bug then this game is a lot of fun. I would not recommend upgrading your system just for this game though.
1609537698,game would a a 10/10 for me but i cant have seccs with the wholesome keanu reeves so it drops it to 1/10
1609537605,in the year 2077 what makes a game  run right? back to the xone ONE X copy i go!
1609537568,definitely worth playing
1609537433,"I'll never forget this play-through, this is one of the greatest games of all time. That's what would have been told by everyone if it wasn't for the rush to get this game out to all the people bitching and complaining about having to wait for a game. This game does have its bugs, as a matter of fact, i played 3 hours without the game saving because one of the missions, racing one, caused the character i needed to talk to to spawn out 100 meters into the air off the side of a cliff. and I couldn't continue my conversation to end the previous mission. God Forbid, you are able to save halfway through a mission. Other than the Cops spawning out of no-where to kill you when you accidentally run over a pedestrian, and the minor bugs, here and there, this game could have been game of the decade, never-mind the year.  

I am running this on a i7 7700k with a 2070 graphics card and 16bg Ram, i averaged 30 FPS during most of the game while in high areas of combat, and during the lesser active times I ran at ~50 FPS"
1609537429,It`s very good if you have a decent PC.
1609537388,fun game
1609537255,"Unfortunately got soft locked. 
Had a bug where I had to ""wait a day for X to call"" on a main story quest but almost 30 hours later that call never came. Looked on the Forums and saw people having a similar problem with many people trying to come up with ""fixes"" with no luck. Even sent in my save file to the CDPR support but have not heard back yet. 
Was having a REAL fun time with cyberpunk but I can't overlook a story softlock."
1609537228,"A story-rich RPG masterpiece that comes only once in 3-5 years.  It does look like some content was cut for the symbolic 2020 release, but it is no less of a great game because of it. Though there are of course flaws in this game, I am very hopeful about its future.
If you want to immerse yourself into a very detailed world for weeks, that will probably make you cry even, look no further. 

This is a game that you do not wait for sale, but buy as soon as you can."
1609537174,"Yes the game does have flaws, but it does not take away from the AWESOME power of the game. The sheer limitation of the game has no bounds it seems. And once more updates and patches come the better it gets. This game has caught a lot of bad rap, mostly for consoles, but to the individual developers who all had their hand in creating this game, I thank you."
1609537675,"[b]TL;DR version:[/b] ultimately heterogeneous (in terms of production quality) game that was nearly killed because of over-expectations from hyping fanboys. Solid 9/10 if you can avoid prejudice of overhype. Worth buying and playing (unless you have a really weak rig).

[b]Long version:[/b] My personal experience with this game differs from the general reception of this game, probably because of the lack of expectations. Didn't like The Witcher series, didn't really anticipated the CP2077 game and surely didn't praise CDPR like it's customary on the internet. And in the end neutral attitude towards the developer and the game itself allowed me to see the gem it is without feeling that I was scammed by someone.

[u]Story[/u] is really solid. It may be because of original source by Mike Pondsmith but CDPR managed to compile it all into a great 40 hour ride that my be not as perfect as RDR2, for example, but it's definitely better than 95% of the games that came out recently. Cutscene cinematography is breathtaking, mo-cap actors and animators did a really god job building the scene for story to shine on. Even side quests tend to have a thoroughly-written script masking the very basic gameplay of these quests. But then, disbalance shows itself: some of the side-quests as well as several main quests resort to notes as a mean of storytelling. It looks and feels cheap, not to mention UI that makes note reading a chore by itself. Main characters are well-written, deep and make you actually care about their part in the story.

One of the few things that seemed to be gimmicky at first was Keanu Reeves participation. At the first glance his only reason to take part in the game production was to bring more customers through heavy celebrity marketing but I was wrong. His role and his acting in this game is the cornerstone of it. He is not just the tool for writers to narrate things, he looks and sounds very real, he has something to say almost about any detail of the story and he truly becomes a part of protagonist and not the background actor. Later in the game developers actually use him as a second protagonist, and it feels very fresh and surreal to see yourself as the main protagonist, V, through the eyes of Johnny Silverhand.

Back to the story quality: the dialogues have basically no influence on the story. This is probably the reason why CDPR stopped marketing the game as ""true RPG"" close to release, because it simply isn't. That doesn't make the game any worse in my opinion, I believe that story that set on some ""rails"" is usually better than a dozen of varied storylines with zero depth. Lifepaths that we choose in the beginning also do almost nothing to how the story progresses.

[u]Gameplay[/u] seems to be disbalanced in terms of quality too. Netrunning and quickhacks, as well as stealth, do not bring unique experience to the table, you're still really dependant on weapons, so in the end you just ask yourself is it even worth to invest into stealth and hacking skills beyond some basic stuff if you're gonna still use guns most of the time. Locations also hurt stealth a lot since most of them are planned without the stealth in mind. It looks like level designers just threw in a few distractions here and there but didn't really think through how it's going to be played. Other games that heavily rely on stealth like Hitman treat level design a lot more serious, crafting the level around the player to create a big puzzle. CP2077 doesn't do that at all. Yes, it's an open-world experience after all, but it shows the lack of attention from the devs.

[u]Weaponry[/u] is pretty great in the beginning (although since we're in the game that treats itself like RPG, stats on the beginners guns are low at best) but after a couple of hours you start to notice that game arsenal is very limited and doesn't really bring versatility to the table. As far as my experience goes, melee weapons solve the enemy problem better, faster and more reliable than guns even without investing too much perk points in them. Expectedly, enemies in the beginning are annoyingly bulletspongey, later in the game they turn into absurdly weak cannon fodder that gets decapitated in dozens without actually hurting player even a bit.

[u]Vehicles[/u], well, are just okay-ish. It serves as a mean of transportation but nothing else. Driving is not enjoyable at all, vehicle diversity is non-existent, and best balanced cars are accessible very early without any downsides. Although, the level of details inside the vehicles really deserves an A+, designers really went an extra mile creating all the little details.

[u]Cyberware[/u] is a bit disappointing but decent. I was expecting to see something really rare and cool in the late game but cyberware choice (especially active one) is not that wide. Gets the job done, though.

[u]World[/u] around the player is uneven as well. Static world, it's design, is good. Some of the things in the level-design department may annoy you a bit because how obvious their purpose is (just to stall you and make you spend some time going through the maze instead of getting from A to B) but it does not lack detail at all. Every district has it's own soul and it doesn't disappoint. Dynamic world, on the other hand, is awful. I am talking about NPCs. [u]AI[/u] in this game is critically bad, and not a single time in the game when you can believe what's happening in the world around you if it's not hard-scripted by developers. NPCs are just bots with no personalities that always walk in circles or sit down and scream as soon as something dangerous happens nearby. Thankfully, game does not rely on NPCs in its gameplay, so player is mostly safe from this abomination of AI.

From the [u]techical side[/u], the game is weird mess. Despite being loaded from NVMe M.2 SSD you always see different LODs of models pop in and out. Vehicles and NPCs keep disappearing behind you, textures failing to load, FPS dropping without any reason, global lighting flickering. It didn't impact my gameplay too much but I believe people with mid-end hardware can suffer a lot of troubles even running the game, not to mention comfortably playing it. On the other hand, when nothing glitches or fails to load, game can show a really beautiful image. Characters are very detailed, textures are crispy even on the background stuff, lighting is gorgeous.

[u]Music[/u] is just beyond perfect. I have no idea how composers managed to create so much tracks that actually fit the narrative but I am excited to listen such great OST in the game. Every track complements the gameplay very well, especially when it comes to scripted events.

In conclusion, my thoughts on multiple release delays: maybe CDPR should've take another one or two delays to polish the game. There are moments in this game when you can clearly see cut content that was sacrificed to ship the game in time. Probably if developers took another path avoiding marketing forced hype and pushing deadlines, the game would be even better."
1609537102,"so far so good. Maybe doesnt live up to some expectations, but overall its enjoyable. very demanding on the hardware side."
1609537078,good game
1609537041,Could have been better but could have been much worse. The story line was a little bland at times but the pacing and variety of things to do made for no dull moments. No regrets.
1609536838,cool game
1609536827,Pretty fun story and gorgeous graphics so far. Loving what I'm seeing.
1609536763,Good. But still has many gliches.
1609536740,It is buggy but none the less a great game
1609536694,"bugs aside, great game"
1609536651,Excellent Game loving everything so far including bugs! Story is was is driving me to play really like it worth the buy if you look for that!
1609536585,"despite its minor flaws (i have experienced minor game glitches, none game breaking) I think this game is really fun and i haven't really gotten into it yet i took the street kid rout and i'm exited to be a corpo and a nomad!"
1609536578,"Really good characters, Jackie will always be my favorite though. Fun gameplay elements and has a rather interesting story that feels different each time you play."
1609536547,i had sexual intercourse with a female for the first time in this game.
1609536455,This game is awesome and was worth the wait! there is so much to do in this game.
1609536329,Definitely a nice single player experience so far and the storyline is interesting so far. I've observed far less glitches then any Bethesda title to date but will update.
1609536304,"there are some irritating bugs at times, the whole world feels less immersive than Witcher 3 - but still a good game (albeit not as awesome as it was hyped to be). looking forward to DLCs (both free as well as paid ones)"
1609536091,kuttar baccha
1609536074,its a good game but it dose have many bugs updates have allowed me to play for long periods of time now though
1609535984,"good game 2021
"
1609535856,Awesome game hence a few little glitches here and there. Great job from cd red project hope the next cyberpunk or future game will be even better.
1609535837,this game is a cross of new vegas and gta  i did not follow any of the hype so to me it seemed a great game that needs to be optimized better for mid to low end pc. i saw the same bugs or worse with bethesda games on launch so i hope the devs and mod community make this a super title instead of just an  ambitious one.
1609535800,"Marketing was great, game was not"
1609535753,"Plan to update this but this is a solid game, buggy but its great."
1609535695,..
1609535668,"I usually do not review games. But with all the negative press around this game I need to. This game should have a thumb side ways but I'm giving it an up. Why? The story, character development, word lore, and setting are all fantastic. If you ignore how horribly buggy the game is right now and all look at that stuff this game is amazing.  Not to mention the leveling system is pretty cool, you use smg's and rifles a lot you get better perks and abilities for those weapons. Love to hack and do it a lot you gain access to better hacking perks.  Combat as it stands is only a challenge on very hard difficulty and could use some balancing but it does require a degree of strategy as it is right now. 

All in All this is a game that everyone should play....in 6 months to a year when all the bugs are patched out. I'd give it on a 1-10 a 5 as it is right now, ignoring the bugs and glitches I'd probably give it a 10."
1609535652,Doesn't have enought big rocks.
1609535571,"A lot of people are complaining about bugs which i haven't experienced any. If you have a PC thats made for gaming and it has good specs there is not much needed to adjust in order to get the most enjoyable gameplay without sacrificing the beautiful graphics. Story is top notch and im thoroughly enjoying it thus far. The introduction is around 5 hours long which is a bit too lengthy in my opinion but once your past that, the game gets extremely fun."
1609535548,"Despite the bugs, the concept is gold. It's a heady cross between GTA V, Fallout 4, Witcher 3, and Deus Ex."
1609535541,yes
1609535531,its dope af but buggy but the game play is amazing and inclusive
1609535528,It is goated

1609534959," I don't care what they say, I had a great time in Night City."
1609534855,Beautiful game.  5th generation game requires 5th gen gear but that doesnt mean it isnt a hell of a game to play. 4.5/5
1609534728,"Enjoyed it, 100% achievements, played through all of the different endings.

Game is unfinished, it needs a barber shop, a tattoo shop, and a plastic surgery shop to change your appearances. Yes, quite a lot of bugs, but I still enjoyed it.

Can't get into a lot of places, lack of romance options, and the money making system is crap. Spent the last few hours grinding to get the Autojock achievement, had to drive around to find random gang areas, and sell off weapons. Couldn't craft enough to make money either. I had thought about eventually upgrading my cyberware to legendary, but the grind is just awful.

I'd wait until they release a couple more patches / add-ons."
1609534704,"I really love the story line, I just wish it was longer... its worth finishing the game with Panam to be honest with you. I really hoped there will be more romance with Panam or special missions with her

Bugs I didn't see, maybe one or twice. Some of the future they said doesnt work, hope they will add them soon.



BUT PLEASE PLEASE, extend the story line... I really enjoyed it. <3"
1609534645,"Open world
Replayability
room for improvement in some features
combat and gunplay is great"

F@#&ing Steam and there BS, won't refund the game.  Don't trust Steam.

Don't believe the lies about this game.  Stay away."
1609534605,40-50fps still was amazing. Looking for more soon. Would want a new gpu for another run through.

1609594774,">>Rig: 
Windows 10 
Samsung 970 EVO M.2 
16GB Cosair DDR4 RAM 
MSI 1070Ti Duke 

>>My first Playthrough: 
Just to give some context to my experience with the game. Going to try and record a high overview of what I saw during my 100+ hour first playthrough without inserting to much of my opinion. Went full netrunner + crafting/tech weapons. I like to try and do all that I can in my playsthroughs so I did all the side missions available and (have not confirmed actual number of endings, just taking a guess from my exp) played through 4 out of the 6 endings. The first playthrough was on normal difficulty. 


>>Gameplay: 
Plays like any modern open world RPG, go anywhere and do “almost” anything with 30 seconds to a few minutes of combat gameplay here and there.  

As the game progressed and your character got stronger, combat was less challenging. My netrunner could take out an entire building of end-game enemies without ever walking through the door. Felt that once I unlocked the epic/legendary weapons/quickhacks/crafting/etc, that’s when difficulty took a sharp turn down.

Didn’t really specialize in any other weapons types besides tech (maybe 4-5 points in handguns/smg/assult). Regardless of what weapons I used, I could one shot anything minus tanky bosses. 

Missions follow the normal scheme:  
Tier 1: Main missions – most diverse, set pieces, progress the game, open new areas/abilities etc.  

Tier 2: Side missions – still diverse objectives, meet interesting side characters that don’t have a ton of impact on the end-game results, they add more potential dialog for game conclusion. (I am being vague to avoid to much information) 

Tier 3: the cookie cutter ‘meh-to-Ok’ missions – these are the ones that are limited but provided fun 2-3 minute combat engagements. They follow one of 5 types: Hitman (assassinate), Thief (steal/retrieve), Hack (upload malware, get info), and neutralize a special target (intentionally being vague again), Help the Cops kill someone (this is where you get crafting specs) 

Tier 4: filler – these are the little fights that can be 30-60 seconds and is “kill the bad people and find evidence” or just kill the ppl. These missions might be finite? But there are tons of them so I never completed them all. 

Typical game loop: Kill, exp, level-up, assign points, rinse repeat until max level 

Lots of cool cars, driving is not the worst thing I have experienced in a game. Some cars feel like they are real cars, others just decided to do donuts regardless of my speed. 

Crafting is clunky. I found that late game when I was needing to make multiple things (parts, upgrade items, etc.) I was really wishing for a function where I could choose how many of an item to craft, or I didn’t have to click and hold the “craft” button for a second every time I crafted an item. (this is just my preference) 

The player can go anywhere on the map; however, CP2077 uses higher enemy levels to funnel you towards certain map locations until a higher level is reached. Example, when you start the game, you won't survive any jobs or fights with valentinos until probably mid level 20s.
 

>>Performance: 
Straight out of the box I ran the game on Ultra settings for everything. I would say I averaged a 40-50 FPS for most of the game. Only once or twice did the FPS dip into the 30s for my rig. I got 50+ FPS outside NightCity when there was not so many object/npc around. 

Didn’t have any game breaking bugs or crashes during my experience. There was definitely bugs, some hilarious, some annoying. T poses, dumb AI, invisible guns, weird menu things etc. Just google it and you can read about CP2077 bugs all day. 

Not to many issues with voiceover. Appreciate the amount of dialog they had in the game. 
 

>>Story: 
This part is more my opinion: I thought the story was coherent and able to be understood and followed. I didn’t find myself saying “What?!?” too often. I liked most of the side characters (the ones that that protagonist could build a relationship with). I don’t think I would say this is the best story a game has ever told but it wasn’t a dumpster fire. 

My biggest grievance is with the ending “choices.” I personally felt there really was only two outcomes and the only variables that change are how to get there, who you piss off doing it, and what the epilogue shows. It’s not garbage like ME3’s ending but it wasn’t what I hoped for. I’m just nitpicking at this point. 
 

>>Opinion: 
I gave the game a positive review because, in my opinion, the game isn’t as horrible as sources as made it out to be. (I am talking about PC, consoles.......sorry folks, join the superior race) I don’t think CDPR made the next “Witcher 3” here but it also isn’t the worst thing on the market. I’m holding out that CDPR isn’t going to completely abandon the game and they will try and fix some of the glaring issues and provide more content. 

I preordered because I loved all three Witcher games and I was willing to role the dice on CDPR. If anyone is really on the fence, I would recommend giving the game some time. Come back in a year or so after DLC drops and issues are ironed out and if the game is still having issues like at launch, pick it up when it goes on sale. I do think it’s worth playing, but maybe at a discounted price with its current state."
1609534477,"Bugs in the game haven't been that bad, don't believe the negative hype as long as you have even a halfway decent machine, easily top 5 game of 2020 across all consoles and systems"
1609534376,nice
1609534343,"I will revisit this review in the future, with a Video review as well. As of right now, I would conclude with over a 100 hours played, this is not a finished game. This is like an Early access game, and the advertisement for this game was deceptive. It is barely a mature game, with a seedy living city. It is slightly this, in only handcrafted missions, that favor a theme that just did nothing for me. The city is inferior to that of ""environments"" you find in ""RDR2"" GTA, Skyrim and so on. The deceptive marketing in this game, is very clear. Its an ACTION ADVENTURE, story driven game, with an Open world that is EMPTY. If you realize that, play the ADVENTURE, and like stories, you will like this game. If you are looking for an Interactive CIty unlike what exist in the real, it will disappoint. To save this game, they need to open it to modders. Modders would make this the Best game ever to exist, if they are anything like Skyrim modders. The potential here is massive, the execution was Scammy. I am now only continuing to play this game, to drive me towards developing an interest in game development for my own projects. Instead of complain so much, I just might do something about it, and make my own content, but, with VR."
1609534327,"Yeah, I fucks with this game."
1609534820,"I think this game is kind of a Rorschach test for people. There are some that really want to like it, they have waited for eight years for what they expected to be the GOAT, and then it's easy to tolerate the objective deficiencies, explain them away as byproduct of an impossible vision, or unreasonable expectations, or simply by pretending that the game is in a different genre than it is and therefore X feature is not necessary. The point is they are able to have fun with the game and that's fine, and you can have fun with it too if you're dead set on it.

Me, I expected a next-gen open world shooter with RPG elements, and by that metric it's a pathetic game. It has very few cool ideas of its own and suffers from gameplay issues that have been solved by GTA 3. 

Your perception of the game constantly hinges on the thinnest veneers of illusions. It's an on-rails experience, predetermined, from the cars and people that move along the street on preprogrammed pathways (and basically crash as soon as that path is blocked), to the dialogue system that, like Fallout 4, tries to hide its linearity behind meaningless flavors of answers that all point to the same next step in your conversation. This works as long as you don't question it too hard, or as long as you don't expect to be able to make your own decisions, or for the world to react accordingly. But then I wonder why they didn't just make a linear shooter to begin with.

The lifepath system is another good example of these illusions. It makes zero difference what you pick, except for giving you a different 10 minute intro cutscene and another way to press [Continue] during dialogue every now and then. Why is it in the game? Because CDPR have said it would be - and they hope you don't realize how irrelevant it is.

The gameplay experience as a whole is standard fare. Most skills are flat percentage increases. You have the usual assortment of grenades and guns that you've seen a thousand times over. You can also hold tab and press F at people to instakill them if you level that branch of your character enough. Meanwhile I'm thinking, it's a scifi game - why not give people some cool gadgets, like a glider, or a gravity gun, or wallrunning, or anything fun? Just Cause 2 came out ten years ago, that game lets me grapple on to a fighter jet, rig it with explosives and crash it into a military base. Cyberpunk has a double jump and guns that shoots through walls. blergh

I could go into this forever, but the main point is, as a gameplay experience Cyberpunk is utterly devoid of ideas while everything that's actually made it in the game feels comparable to the cardboard scenery of a school play where if you tap any of the pieces too hard it might fall over and tear the entire thing down with it, revealing the gaggle of confused children and overworked adults that have been desperately trying to hold it up from behind.

It's very clear that CDPR have bitten off more than they could chew. If you don't care all that much and just want a generic shootymans game you can play one of the dozen games Cyberpunk is trying to imitate, otherwise get this on sale if you're really that hellbent on hanging out with Keanu Reeves"
1609534210,Not at all as advertised.
1609534078,fuck the haters
1609534040,"A good game, would be a masterpiece without the bugs and missing content."
1609533853,"Let me be honest this game is a bit of a buggy mess but when all the bugs are dealt with this game would be amazing, not that it isn't already, I just think it would be better without the bugs."
1609533737,"Don't believe the negative press. Buggy, but provides a huge and deep open world experience."
1609533711,"I don't think I need to say something that has been said to a great number of people

The gameplay is what turns me down the most, because I expected something more tactical rather than just shooting. The hacking system is there just for decoration, it doesn't have much usage since the AI in this game is not at its best

Many bugs and performance issues

I won't get back on playing this game anytime soon until all of the patches are released

The marking for this game made a lot of people hyper (me included) and just to find out that it wasn't much what we expected to be"
1609533294,Great game aside for the visual bugs
1609533148,"The best part is the story, and the open world elements are just okay. The RPG elements are great and in depth, although I wish there were more interesting choices to make on the perk trees, and that they overlapped. I have high reflex, but it doesn't make sense to spend perks in both assault and pistols, just spec into one or the other. The game is a buggy mess, maybe worse than a newly launched Bethesda game."
1609533143,"Despite it's technical flaws, most of the bugs have become somewhat endearing and comical. At times they may be infuriating if you don't have a recent save to load from, but the the story and the experience has been worth it for me, regardless of the hiccups along the way, just like life itself."
1609533117,One of the best games
1610005291,"Do I feel like I got my moneys worth from the game? Yes. That said I expected more, I expected what they told us to expect and this certainly is not it. It's a fine game that really has its moments but I really don't see a No Man's Sky situation happening here. I hope I'm wrong but I just think fundamentally there are so many things Cyberpunk got wrong that it is going to take a lot to make it what it could be. Not to mention I'm having a hard time seeing the modding community swooping in and saving the day if this game is anything like the Witcher 3, even if its better , it would need to be on the level of skyrim for us to ever see any gameplay changes or quest mods , etc.

"
1609533013,"Story, dialogue, gun play all very very very good. Everything else average meh so far. Would recommend just for story."
1609532955,its good now play it
1609532942,"despite all the bugs, I love the story. And as I have been playing buggy gamesl like this for years (albeit none as buggy as this, not even Skyrim), I have no issue with it. I pray the devs patch the game up, and add more content in the future."
1609532941,<3
1609540427,"The game is too buggy at its current state. The citizens of night city are just gta pedestrians. Then at some times actually nails the heart of the game and is beautiful. The constant bugs, bad body physics, and visual bugs break the heart it is trying to capture. There is no difference between big sidequest vs a small and repetitive ones, and buying cars pops up in the same waypoint as a mission. The core combat is good but fails to deliver when you are either wildly overpowering enemies (actually you kind of feel like a badass when you are chopping apart enemies with the mantis blades) or you get one shot by a more powerful guy. . The gunplay is fun and there is variety with tech/power/smart weapons, each having it's own freshness. Despite the negatives, the game is fun and still fresh for it's time, and satisfied me with the gameplay and im holding out for the future updates. I cope

A tip for leveling: You can have three max level 20 stats, while there are 5 stats, Body, Reflexes, Technology, Intelligence, and Cool. You are then left with having a stat be at 3 and a stat being at 8 for min max, or divvying out 3(?) points between two stats. You can use all stats in certain dialogue checks; as well as your background. The game does not make this clear.

Also people who were plagued with not being able to kill anyone and killing your fps: unequip the legendary quickhack: cripple movement."
1609532914,"Ignoring the collective internet echo-chamber, this is a fun RPG, reminding me quite a lot of Oblivion, with an abundant amount of genitals, and less horse buttholes. 9/10."
1609532853,"Buggy, but a sturdy fun game. Hoping they add co-op and such, as I can see a lot of potential for it in the game now. Overall a fun semi-immersive game, as every so often a bug or piss poor AI will destroy all immersion."
1609567289,"Not the [game changer] many expected, but a decent game with a great story so far (I've yet to finish the main story line) and with gobsmacking good graphics.
(Just FYI, playing it on a Ryzen 7 1700 with GTX1080. Even without RTX it's still good looking and running at 60+ fps on ultra)

No new mechanics. Just the same old stuff in a different setting, but oh... what a glorious setting it is.

It's got some bugs, but I haven't experienced any game breaking ones yet (50+ hours in). I'm sure the rest will get patched up real quick and I've played games with more bugs than this. So QA failed a bit but despite the occasional glitch that can mostly be solved with a quick save reload, I find myself coming back to finish the story and contemplating how I'll play it on the second and third play through.

So yea, I'd say it's a great game. If you can pick it up on a sale, awesome. Otherwise, if you have the eddies to burn, I'd say you could do a lot worse than this game. FFS, I've bought absolute junk before in the same price range. This is an unpolished gem (for now), but I've no doubt that CDPR will tweak it."
1609532842,This game has been awesome for weeks now.  The people complaining just have shitty computers to run it
1609532838,"I dont even feel like finishing the game. Just started ACT 3 and Im bored to tears. The game is not very immersive as your sense of immersion is broken constantly by all kinds of ridiculous things like police appearing out of nowhere, people disappearing, a constant barrage of phone calls from complete strangers offering you petty jobs while your very life is on the line in the game. You either stick to the story 100% and stay immersed, or you say screw it and run off and do a bunch of stuff that makes absolutely no sense.

Other gripes include an inability to drive at a normal speed, walk at a normal speed, etc... Things that you would think a modern AAA studio would have dialed in dont exist, feels like a game made in 2005 with modern graphics. The character customization is actually sub-par. You cannot choose asymetrical options for cybernetics or eyes for example (so you cant have one cybernetic eye). There are many obvious hairstyles missing from the game. The colorization options are also lacking, they could have just included a gradient system for hair and let you choose 1-2 colors, instead they give you like a dozen options and thats it. Tattoo options are lacking severely, you are either completely tatted up or have no tats at all. You cant just choose from an array of tats and where they are placed. For a game that explained itself as having ""the most character customization options ever"", I find this to be blatently false. Its a medium level of customization at best. As usual, most likely we will have to wait for modders to get more options, but by then who will even care about this game anymore?

Has great graphics but the story is railroaded hard, choices feel like illusions, there is really nothing to explore and to the extent that you can explore, most of the game looks the same to me. Also if you deign to explore early in the game get ready to be BOMBARDED BY NONSTOP PHONE CALLS for about 20 minutes as you wander the city.

Speaking of phone calls, the game gives you no incentive to care about almost any of the characters in the game whatsoever, and does not take the time to weave them into the story whatsoever. They are just random people calling you but acting like your old friend, even though you've never met.

The story is nice insofar as its a cool theme for a Cyberpunk sci-fi story, but Im tired of ""waiting for a day for so and so to call"" for every quest I have to continue at this point. It looks nice, but beyond that... its not the immersive Cyberpunk oriented RPG I was hoping for.

Another gaming disappointment."
1609532838,"This game is great, engaging, super fun, and really well written.  Looking forward to updates and DLC as it comes!"
1609532837,"Fun but still lots of glitches, i still like playing it and i think it will be really awesome in 3-6 months of patches"
1609532837,"Cyberpunk 2077 is a great game, and one that hopefully will only get better. The issue is the launch that lets be honest, wasn't great. It was EA level of awful. However, the story, the visuals, the missions, and the world is fantastic. As they work to fixing all the bugs and crashes, people will see the beauty in this game.

Steam are there to charge you for your game but not for the support. 

Many glitch, many bugs, many useless AI, many sound files missing... When i try to verify my game files to be sure everythings is ok it keep re-downloading some game files, i had to tweak the flag files for the game mostly everytimes. 

Seriously im sad about all this, it could be a great game but for now its not. Its a waste of time and money."
1609532259,"I'm going to be honest to my experience and my experience alone. This game is a lot of fun, a lot of graphical glitches a few annoying ones, and a couple times where my sprint stopped working so I had to restart.

Overall if you like really expansive RPGs and have a computer that has the ability to run it well, I highly recommend this game. Definitely play the sidequests too, some really good stories in there, even if they feel less expansive compared to the Witcher 3."
1609532149,"Ambitious to a fault. The games biggest drawback was the hype train, and there are tons of ideas and points in-game that are not fleshed out or were obviously abandoned so the dev's could make a release date this decade. Hopefully the game continues to get love and support (and mod tools) for years to come. Its got that ""Skyrim"" feel to it where it could be built upon for a long time. The game itself is solid, play is fun. Lots of what you would expect in things like RPG elements and dialogue are sadly missing, with the game going more action than action-rpg. Might as well not have a prompt to talk to NPC's. Food system is vestigial because all the buffs are the exact same and their is no hunger or thirst mechanic.
 Still, its worth picking up, even if your gonna wait for a sale."
1609531899,"amazing story, okay gameplay, impressive detail, extremely glitchy. Its still a must buy but Wait for bug fixes then buy."
1609531863,"I really thought it was just bugs and weird graphical glitches because that's all everyone talks about, but no. 
If you have a decent PC (and enable SMT through mod/hex edit if you're using an 8+ core ryzen) its totally playable. 

You take damage like a shooter, 3-5 shots can kill you, sometimes more sometimes less, on top of getting hacked and taking overheat damage, or taking damage through what I assume is a toxic grenade that being the radius of for even a second triggers a near total drain of your health. All of that would of course be fine and is pretty in line with other games that control like this one. 

The difference is, even though you're using weapons with the same or higher DPS as your enemy, they take a fraction of the same damage. Having to unload multiple magazines to kill a random t shirt wearing gang member is immersion breaking, boring, and annoying. Even in stealth you can walk up and shoot someone in the back of the head, have them turn around barely damaged and kill you instantly with a burst from an SMG. 

Will this get better as you level up and get better weapons and stats, yea probably, but that doesnt excuse how ridiculously lazy this combat system is. Instead of making a unique combat experience or even one thats just fun, CDPR decided to take FPS mechanics, but pair them with RPG health, stats, and multipliers in a way that is not only immersion breaking, stupid, and boring, it just doesn't actually even make sense. ""150 DPS"" is completely fucking meaningless if you don't know how much health an enemy has, though I must assume they have thousands of HPs because they will not die. Maybe you get lucky and get a crit or something, but why? That isn't how guns work, it doesn't make sense, and it doesn't actually have a purpose, its like they added all these combat mechanics from RPG games just because they thought they had to, not because it actually made the game better. Multiple times in the story missions people die off single gunshots and yet its impossible to kill an enemy in combat without far more (most of the time, especially early game).

Just why? This game has so much potential. Its like somebody started with the assumption that every game in each genre has to work a certain way, and then tried to combine two of those genres. It's just such a waste to create such a beautiful world and then throw the player in with fucking movement and combat mechanics that barely rival Ark let alone a AAA-quality game. What was supposed to be innovating and interesting and our first taste of real next gen gaming, is just a stale mile wide inch deep uninspired boring mess. 

If this game had been designed as an open world FPS it could've been on the same level as Red Dead, instead I'll probably forget about it entirely in a few weeks a most. I wouldn't be surprised if this exact conversation happened on the Dev team because it honestly feels like two completely separate visions of this game are competing for dominance and its terrible. Just embarrassing honestly. Did anyone outside the studio even playtest this game because pretty much anyone could've played 20 minutes of this and would've been able to tell them, ""Holy shit do not release this game yet you're going to get eaten alive."" 

If the game functioned perfectly and just was poorly balanced I'd still love it. But the fact that its infuriatingly poorly thought out, AND clunky as shit, buggy, and performs poorly without a substantial amount of fine tuning, makes this honestly just not worth playing. I'll come back to it in a year when the bugs are fixed and I can get a 3080 and a 5800x."
1609531812,"One of the most hollow game experiences I have ever played, ripe with the illusion of choice, bugs, and performance issues."
1609531652,better then gta in my opinion
1609531645,"Disappointment. I wanted to really like this game but I can't recommend it in its current state. It's extremely obvious that it was released far too early (when CDPR said it'd be released when it's ready).

I really enjoyed the story, the setting, the visuals and the characters. I thought these key aspects were excellent for the most part and they really elevate the game, though I did feel that the story is let down by its relatively short length and mostly linear structure. The life paths are very disappointing; the backstory is incredibly short (around 20 minutes or so) and they make no real difference in the game except a bit of dialogue. To me it also felt sometimes like parts of the story were missing or disjointed. For example, after your backstory, your introduction to Night City is just a montage and you then immediately start planning a heist. I also felt that with some of the main characters you don't spend enough time with and was disappointed you can't really do any activities with them outside of the missions. I was also disappointed with how the ending is handled. To me it felt quite abrupt how the game ends and it is not possible to continue/free-roam beyond the ending (instead you are taken back to the point of no return).

The bugs are very frequent; they're very annoying and immersion-breaking, ranging from visual bugs to game breaking ones. This alone should delay someone's purchase until CDPR have fixed it. Performance wasn't an issue for me (on a 3080) however your mileage may vary. AI is overall abysmal; NPCs are genuinely brain-dead with no real routine, enemies are as dumb as a rock and the police are a joke - forget an actual wanted system and police chases, they literally spawn meters away from you instead (I've had police spawning in the same room as me as soon as I got a wanted level out of nowhere) and they forget about you after you've ran a couple blocks away. The open-world is also extremely superficial with little to do in it besides story and side missions. Some basic customisation is also missing, for example with guns and vehicles... you also can't even change something as simple as your hairstyle once you've created your character... Overall I was disappointed with the open-world aspect and RPG mechanics (where it was supposed to be ""an RPG first and foremost"").

For the most part, I did enjoy the game and I look forward to future content however it disappoints as an RPG and open-world game, and the state it was released in is completely unacceptable. It is a shame because the game does a lot of things really well and the foundation is very strong. I would not recommend picking this game up until they've fixed the most glaring issues with it."
1609663699,"Just because it looks good doesn't mean its good

RPG part of the game is generic as fuck
regarding inventory its few steps under Borderlands tier
weapon modifications? lmao get real there is no reason to use them
activities around city are Sleeping Dogs, but worse
main campaign sucks ass tbh famalam, all NPCs are retards and act like retards
entire Tarot thing does not fit and feels forced
there is not enough hacks to make hacking feel interesting
side gigs are usually too short and feel same-ish
performance is bad to meh to ok

UPDATE 1
if the devs spent half the money they spent on damage control and fetishist romances (only 1 purely normal romance and 4 kinds of LGBTRTFAGDBBQKGB insanity) game could actually be good. Not to mention tranny jannies on Steam forums actively attacking any sort of criticism against game or their insanity

I had more fun pew pew shooting random people all over the city after doublejumping than actually reading dialogues and caring about overarching plot that was all over the place

6/10, would be better if the development money was spend on better coding instead of on over 9000 radio songs"
1609531240,"Overall, the game was pretty good. I thought the world was interesting and a lot of the side quests were really cool. The main plot was interesting as well though I preferred the side stuff for the most part. I found Judy and Panam's questlines in particular to be pretty cool.

However, I found the game a bit restrictive at times as to how I can play my character in term of their personality. Like no matter what you do, you're playing a mercenary whose biggest goal is to become a Night City legend which wasn't what I really wanted to be. The dialogue was a big part of that. In most conversations, you had one dialogue option, maybe 2 so it's definitely important to keep in mind that you're playing a predefined character and not really your own. The origins are also largely inconsequential with only a few dialogue lines added. 

A big problem with the narrative was the lack of any meaningful choices. For the most part, the only big choice you get to make during the main quest is which ending you have. The rest of the game is pretty linear. What choices are present ion side quests also don't have much in the way of consequences or repercussions in the world. 

In terms of gameplay, it was fun to play. The combat was fun and I enjoyed the stealth system the game had for the most part. Playing on a decent PC, I didn't encounter anything too bad though there were some minor bugs which are all over the place like floating objects, but nothing game breaking.

Overall, I found the game to be pretty good, but disappointing when it came to the narrative, RPG elements you'd expect. If you go in thinking of the game as a fairly linear open world action game, it'll be a lot of fun but don't expect much more than that."
1609531204,"this game was a let down ultimately, thought there would be more to their world, it just feels like an incomplete game, for me this game does not match the randomness and freedom of the GTA series, RDR 2, and such, the combat was fun, but there was not enough of it for me, too much shity dialogue not enough action, and not total freedom as they advertised, truly i think everyone got conned. This game was grossly hyped and It failed as an open world game, I tried to complete everything, but got bored after awhile."
1609531192,"I love this game so far. Granted that I don't think it is exactly as it was advertised, it is still a really good game"
1609531128,"Half-baked doesnt begin to describe it. So many immersion breaking bugs/limitations on NPC AI. I want to love this game, its shown glimpses of being fun; Its just not there yet. Might try to get through a playthrough in 6 months or so. Til then the game is shelved"
1609531050,"Cyberpunk 2077, after spending some time on it i am feeling not satysfied at all:
Both graphic and the world itself are very beautiful but instead of implementing ray tracing which is still a feature limited to a limited part of the gaming comunity ( rtx required or a ps5 or xbox one x) they could implement many other sides of the title.
Storyline: the intro quest its extremely cool and it show you the power of making different choices based on your background(like corporative etc.) and also based on your character customization( choice that require strenght,reflexes or other) but after this first mission these ""true"" rpg choices will become very rare and most of the time they will not affect the game or the quest in any way; example: you must have at least 8 strenght to force open a door but this is feel meaningless if you can just break and enter from the window next to the door.
gameplay: i dont care so much about bugs or glitches,its natural for a just released open world title to have some so i am gonna skip this part and of course if you hate a buggy games just avoid buying it now but cdproject already said that fixing this part will be their priority; weapons are cool, you can manage many settings about them like if you want a realistic sway and recoil or aim assist as a little help( i really appreciate this honestly it open the game also to people that are new to this fps/rpg mix) blades and meele on the other hand feel very clunky and cumbersome and there are very few animations. The game feel also grindy as the only way to get money is to 1) complete quest 2)hack stuff but most of the object you can hack have an intelligence level requirement so you are forced to put points on that. Oh almost forgot veichles are undrivable and physics its not that realistic.
Open world: this is the part that i really didnt like, apart from the story and secondary mission the world has almost none interaction( its not like other famous rpg where by just going around in the world you will have special encounters,places to visit/explore,eastereggs or just fun), the only thing you can do is kill people( they will give you no loot,money,or weapon) change clothes and pay for having sex,yup, and about the last sentence i must admit that sexuality has a big role in this game, in many part of the game there  are reference more or less explicit, even going around in the city 90% advertisement is women asses or half naked men also many object that you can take are condoms,dildos, tentacular dildos etc. it saddens me to see such a limited and more marketing orientated choice like this one especially from a studio which i thought was closer to the customer more than the industry,but well this is 2020 society.
Multiplayer: its still not implemented and i just wanna say that because of all the work that these game need and the current situation that mankind is facing right now which also limit the job that developers can make i dont think its ,gonna come out in 2021.
Conclusion: First of all if my english is bad or if i said something wrong i am sorry and remember that this is just one of the opinion of many gamers that you can find here. Cyberpunk to me looks more like an adventure game  with some rpg stuff badly implemented on it, and it failed to make me wanna play it again, at least until they make huge changes so it can be months, years and also it can never happen, be sure to consider also this and to inform yourself good and from various sources before thinking to acquire the game. Feel free to comment the review in a bad or a good way if you dont agree with me, and i repeat this is just my opinion."
1609531049,"Amazing
"
1609530886,"Not a fan of the combat and the driving is terrible. It didn't take me long to figure out it wasn't for me, but too long for a refund. After a system upgrade it won't even run. I wish I hadn't purchased it, but there it is."
1609530880,"I liked it, in fact i'm playing through it a second time because I rushed through the main storyline and apparently missed out on a bunch of good side quests, also wasn't thrilled with the ending I got. Gonna go for a different start path, different gendered V, do more quests, and aim for a more satisfying ending. I had no idea what to expect from this game, I only played it because I liked The Witcher and figured it would be similar, but a different theme. It runs fine on my PC, encountered a few bugs in 50+ hours of play that required a game restart but not a huge deal."
1609530820,good
1609530737,"Do jeito que está eu nao recomendo nao kkkkk
jogo quebrado, mal polido. o tempo e os modders o transformarão em algo primoroso, mas por enquanto é indefensável."

1609530683,Just amazing if you have good setup
1609530682,"It's No More Heroes for the PC... and I loved No More Heroes.

"
1609530656,"Despite the launch issues, and cut features, the story and the world building makes it worth playing.
All in all it feels sort of like a Fallout3-4 in a way (including the constant struggle with the inventory space).

Fair warning though, the world of Cyberpunk is cruel and unforgiving, so keep that in mind before you'd blame a negative ending on the game. It is the world itself that makes a classic happy ending near-impossible.

The side missions and gigs however are full of life, each of them interesting and with a heavy dose of personality, giving you the opportunity to immerse yourself, even to the point where you can just chill with the people you got to know through your adventures.

In that aspect the game is a major success and with the upcoming fixes it'll get only better.

Yes currently (played since release day to shortly after 1.06 completed it in roughly 100 hours) it is buggy, quite often you end up dying from falling off a trashbag, or have to reload a save because you accidentally killed someone you just wanted to put down while carrying or something is glitching out, but for me the immersion factor and memorable characters matter the most.

I really hope they'll add back the features they took out, like actual full body modifications including ""glam"" and every other style and for the love of god maybe we'll be able to get a haircut eventually :P

TL;DR: Yes, buggy, but worth it for the immersion and world building."
1609530597,"It's a great game if you look at it as a story-driven FPS. As an open world RPG its meh.
The REDEngine is raw and unfinished. AI is shit, driving is shit, melee combat is shit. Thing like cop AI, already prefected by GTA and RDR2 is absent in this game. Cops just spawn behind you. Civilian AI is non-existent. Lots of engine bugs all around. I'd say wait a year or two and it will be in a finished state,"
1609530527,"So much potential, needed just 3 more months of development and probably would've been one of my more favorite games I've played in recent years. Cannot recommend it in its current state, I am praying they fix all of these problems."
1609530510,Epic game
1609530472,"Driving is terrible, cars are heavy and bulky yet have no traction at all. 

Shooting is pretty mediocre, even boring. Not enough variation in the guns, all feel the same. The tutorial section for shooting is extremely dull and unimaginative.

From the little story I have done it isn’t good, needs more work introducing you to the characters to make them seem likeable and make you care about them. Plus the introduction section for your character type (corpo, streetkid, nomad) just seems so underwhelming, barely worth including it in its current state.

The AI for the npc’s is so bad, makes the world seem dead. 

The RPG and looting aspect is complete trash currently, that being said I always hate games with extremely grindy looting with tiny incremental stat buffs as you level up.

Nothing in this game is new or revolutionary."
1609530412,NAIS!
1609530340,Comes with funny bugs but It's still a really gorgeous game.
1609530207,"It's pretty fun when it's not lagging. There are bugs, but the only ones that bother me are the ones that make me phase through reality. Make sure you have an above average computer to play this without frame drops as well."
1609530163,"This game is broken.  I don't have top hardware but okay.  Should run it fine.

Ryzen 3700x on a EVGA 2070 super.  3200 mhz ram cl 16.  B450 chipset. Corsair 750x. Samsung 970.

Now, I was really excited for this game.  I like a good story and from what I see it has a good one.  The bugs are too much for me.  NPC's disappear, drawing distance is ugh.  Textures and graphics remind me of fallout 3.  I run it on some medium and some high settings with raytracing low and dlss set for auto.  Seems to be the best settings for me and it still looks trash.  Turned off motion blur, chromatic and film grain, helped a little and still looked like trash.  The targeting system for the gun play is trash.  Hard to aim with a controller.  \

Reminds me a lot of Fallout 3 and Outerworlds but with a lot of freezes, glitches and crappy graphics.  Just not worth 60 bucks right now.

I tried to refund it but Steam said I played over 2 hours.  I probably did thinking it would get better.  Nope.  Sometimes I leave a game running also when I do other things.  I just bought it 5 days ago but it seems I'm stuck with this hot garbage.  Maybe another patch will fix it.  I'll wait."
1609530128,best game
1609530029,The world is incredibly vibrant and immersive. Every decision you make feels like it has a profound impact. Can't recommend it enough. 10/10 experience. Most of the time bugs just give you a quick laugh anyways.
1609529993,"Try to be many things and only achieve to be the most graphic intense game in the market.

Investors are suing for good reason. A lot of Marketing statements about game content never reached the game. 

1. They promised the background story will dramaticly influence your play experience in night city, not so it all generic with a couple of unique dialogue options that dont change anything in terms of mission/gig directions.
2. Dynamic weather phenomena that influence battles nver made the cut.
3. Deep ""net-runner"" demo footage that revealed mantis claws running up on vertical walls and taking down enemies in stealth, showing 3D maps of location after you hacked NPC's, or the companion bot never made it into the final release.
4. The 5 classes of vehicles and customization with a focus on racing never made it into the game, you have a bunch of generic vehicles where you pay for a fancy skin. No game-play value at all, this is the same for the advertised buying property. You almost never have any insentive to go to your pad, not to mention cant buy new ones, just get them free when you finished some main story missions.
5. NPC was marketed as having complete 24 day cycles, they are buggy and you cant interact with any of them outside the gig/mission framework.

This is just the main marketed ideas that are not delivered on...."
1609529957,Playing on a 6 year old rig at lowest settings and its still a blast!
1609529944,Great game! Still has some minor bugs but the Devs are updating very consistently to fix those issues! Game is great if you're looking for something similar to the witcher without the 100 hour story line.
1609529932,"Bugs, lots of bugs... This is a great game tho, just unfinished."
1609529899,yum
1609529889,yes
1609529859,"Bugs are fun, cockroaches aren't. Saw cute kitty 10/10"
1609529826,"This game is everything I hoped it would be! I must admit I was a little disappointed by the ending choices however that alone isn't enough for me to hate on this game even a little. The connection you build with some of the NPC's is very nice and draws you in emotionally. The tech weapons that shoot through walls blew my mind and made game play so enjoyable, I understand this game is getting a lot of hate, but it wouldn't have if (we the fans) hadn't put so much pressure on CDPR. They have an outstanding reputation for quality. This game is amazing and I only experienced a couple of bugs in my two play through's. And I love this game so much I plan on a few more play through's after DLC's drop."
1609529799,Game breaking bug. Everytime I go up an elevator for a main story quest game crashes. No matter what graphics settings I make or driver updates. Just a shame.
1609529730,"So I am of two minds about this game.

On the one hand - I think that it could have benefitted from a few more months in the oven. It is a little buggy, poorly optimized, and you can tell there were features half-implemented/implemented poorly to get it out the door.

That said, the game itself has a solid core loop of shooting looting and scooting, and the story more than makes up for its deficiencies. If you are a fan of New Vegas, Fallout 4, or even Mass Effect 2 this game is going to be right in your ballpark. It is not the immersive cyberpunk life-sim that the hype-train geared it up to me.

It is an action-RPG with an emphasis on character interaction, and a serviceable progression system. If you've got a system that can run it, there's at least a solid 40-50 hours of game here if you're not putting your nose to the map like I am trying to find every little thing. And it's only going to be better with time!

Just like the Witcher 3!"
1609529721,"In the process of trying to get a refund. Game is unfinished, many bugs where I need to quit and restart to play it again. The game feels nothing like and RPG and gives me no drive to explore like I would a regular RPG. Feels like a linear game, linear story. If I don't get my refund oh well, lesson learned to stay off the hype train"
1609529702,5/7
1609529620,"This is everything I've been waiting for for years. It's gorgeous, its sleek, it is replayable. The gameplay is a lot of fun and if you have great specs on your pc it looks incredible. The world is very immersive and pleasant to lose yourself in. This is a worthy followup to the CDPR lineup. 

The only possible complaint I have, is that V is not nearly as compelling of a character as Geralt is. Few videogame leads are."
1609529552,"Regardless of the bugs, it's a great game with a well written story line. FYI... Best on top tier systems that can push a big graphics card. I consider my PC intermediate level performance. The busy scenes bog my FPS to 23 or so. Still playable but blurry in high action sequences."
1609529544,"What an amazing and beautiful game! CDPR clearly put, A LOT of work into designing this game! There are quite some negative reviews out there, but those mainly concern the console (PS4 / Xbox One) versions. The PC version runs like a charm and is an absolute must have for anyone who likes to wander around in a big city and area around it.

The map is full of acitivity without getting boring or repetitive. Everything looks wonderful and you can find something to do around every corner. Main story is great and many side quests are even better."
1609529465,its pretty fun
1609529460,Incredible on a 3080.
1609529403,"As you know, there are a few bugs, but I have a mid-low gaming laptop, and as long as I dont try to use ray tracing, it works fine. Game wise, its probably one of the best I've ever played story and immersion wise. Very fun, and don't fall for all the bandwagon haters on youtube- it's worth buying!"
1609529370,"This game does have bugs however, Most of the time it runs as intended and it is the most detailed RPG I have played ever! Well worth the wait, cant wait for the optimization patch."
1609529541,"[b]Summary[/b] 
After finishing my first playthrough at 115hrs, I can safely say this is one of the best games I got to play in my 30yrs gaming career. It doesn't mean its perfect, but what it gets right it absolutely nails.
Please make sure you know what you are getting yourself into before you buy: This is a [u]story-driven RPG[/u] that thrives on building fantastic immersion, much like Deus Ex or Kingdom Come Deliverance. This is [u]not an open-world sandbox[/u] like GTA. 



The game is not perfect, it does have its hick-ups:
[list]
    [*]Like improvable (but not immersion-breaking) AI
    [*]A way too zoomed-in Mini-Map while driving
    [*]Better police system (though the police is generally not as prominent a mechanic as in GTA)
    [*]No Transmog which is really desperately needed
    [*]No Walk-Toggle for keyboard
    [*]Most importantly though this game seemingly requires a relatively up-to-date rig. That said I ran this game on a 2080, i9700 on 4k RTX Ultra with no crashes and only minor bugs (eg. clipping NPCs) since launch day.
[/list]

In my opinion the pros heavily outweigh the cons of this game. 
[list]
    [*]This game is drop-dead gorgeous and IMHO makes the best use of RTX to date. Especially the characters with their top-notch voice and animation work shine.
    [*] This is hands-down the most well-written game I have every played. Yes, the main story is not revolutionary in what it tells, but very much so how well it does it. This is again mostly due to how incredibly well the characters are realized. Judy, Panam, Jackie, Delamaine, Rogue and Johnny feel so incredibly real, and their stories are touching. This is one of the most memorable character casts in gaming. And the best part of the story is that the side quests are the actual star. They are all interesting and all very well written. And most importantly quests are tied to each other, which means completing a side quest can absolutely open new paths in the main story. 
    [*] This is the best soundtrack in a game. Everything the sound design of weapons and vehicles, to the great radio stations (I'm a hip-hop head, but damn that rock channel is something else) and perfect sountrack that picks up when the action is going.
[/list]

Like I said I had no Performance Issues, but you should 100% set DLSS to Balanced and  reduce ""Cascaded Shadow Distance"" to medium.

Other than that I 100% agree that CDPR deserved a backlash for the terrible console versions. but do not listen to the haters that drop their reviews here and elsewhere with <10 hrs playtime. There is no chance they can really tell what this game is about"
1609529306,"good game, open world"
1609529167,"Unfinished, would barely call it an RPG. Personal opinion: would need a re-do from the ground up. Buggiest game I've played in years."
1609529109,What a disappointment.
1609529074,I've heard a lot of complaints about this game but I haven't had any bad experience with it. Lot's of fun like a sci-fi Grand Theft Auto.

1609528718,"If you like open-world games like Skyim, Deus Ex, and GTA, this game is like a combination of those three. The amount of things to do a little details in the world = unmatched, although it comes at the cost of being buggy. As of patch 1.06, the game is luckily perfectly playable and enjoyable on the PC. It's still definitely buggy, but it's rarely anything game breaking. Bugs are usually related to physics and collision detection. Floating objects, people falling through things, etc. Things that are eye-roll worthy, but things that shouldn't prevent you from enjoying of the game. There ARE some larger bugs and performance is still very spotty (even on ultra high-end hardware), but the game is still playable if you don't mind being an early adopter. The closest comparison I can give is when Skyrim launched. Buggy, but still enjoyable. It'll likely be a lot more polished by mid-2021, but it's still a good/fun game right now in spite of its issues."
1609528694,i would definetly reccomend this game so realistic so all the action romance etc
1609528682,"A high-tech and horny Bethesda game.  Go into it with that mindset and you should have a good time.

Super pretty with ray tracing on."
1609528442,worth the glitches and bugs. story is repetetive and pretty short but the side missions are fun and the soundtrack and shooting mechanics are great. the world of night city is really immersive even with the poor npc interactions
1609528434,"I cannot comment on how this plays on a console, but I have had minimal issues on my PC.  Playing through slowly and just taking it all in.  Worth the cash IMHO."
1609528403,"From my experience with the game, Cyberpunk has been a thrilling, fun adventure to play through. I enjoy the story, characters, and side missions you can do, and while I have encountered some glitches and bugs, nothing was game-breaking or hindered my immersion. Overall, I think this game is super fun and has a ton of replay value. I would 100% recommend."
1609528309,"It’s not the life-altering experience many wrongly believed it would be. And sadly, in many ways, it’s not the monumental leap from current to next-gen that CDPR often showed us. But half way through my second playthrough I can say that, at its core, Cyberpunk 2077 an incredible game boasting impressive storytelling and convincing performances. The gritty story is thrilling and diverse, including many well written, and equally well acted, characters. Characters who are extraordinary and original, yet complex and relatable. Characters who fit within the world presented, making it feel real and alive. The inclusion of Keanu Reeves could have felt out of place and unnecessary, but he plays his character extremely well and is incorporated as a very intimate associate to V (the player). Similarly to The Witcher 3, the game is full of incredible side quests with some flawlessly continuing aspects of the main story, and some containing their own rich tales. The questlines which continue off the main story all focus on a character each, allowing the player to discover the depth with which they are written with. Full of slang and attitudes that vary and quickly become familiar, Night City often feels ruthless, dirty and corrupt, but most importantly: alive and breathing. Accompanying the writing and worldbuilding, the score/soundtrack simultaneously maintains immersion and evokes emotion.

The combat is far more enjoyable than I was expecting and gives the player plenty of choice with how they want to play. Sadly there aren’t many other significant decisions the player gets to make, often offered dialogue choices which all lead to the same outcome. There are also many technical issues (ignoring the glitches that the game is currently riddled with), such as sub-standard AI intelligence and frankly poor optimisation – at the moment the ‘recommended’ system requirements are far from reaching a consistent 60 fps at medium settings. These issues feel amplified here, as the worldbuilding is otherwise incredibly immersive. 

Whilst it disappoints on some levels, the game is phenomenal in most areas and definitely deserves attention among those who are able to play it. 
9/10
"
1609528305,"Soooo bad, maybe after another patch....Hardware requirements are insane."
1609528270,"I had waited since the annoucement for this game but I didn't watch all the videos and hype that came in the last year or so. No game ever lives up to over marketing expectations. I enjoyed my time in CP2077. I 100% the game and was able to complete every quest, which isn't something I can say about most AAA games there always a quest you can't finish. There are plenty of glitches, so if you want a perfect game or have a low end PC I'd wait till February. Currently its a gooey cookie, if you prefer a perfectly cooked cookie wait. I enjoyed it and recommend it. 

Specs:
I7-8700k
32GB DDR4

Played at 4k 60HZ Everything maxed out or on Psycho. Buttery smooth no frame rate issues."
1609528261,It's an early access but i don't see it marked as one. Anyone knows why?
1609528170,"Look, we all know that at release this was not a finished game. It's buggy, it's full of signs of unfinished or cut content, and it's a pretty rough experience on consoles. I'm still having a blast playing the game, though, so I think it's worth it. Even for what it is, you can get your money's worth out of this game, and I think it'll improve as they patch it."
1609528163,pretty good glitches are fun and silly and its fun to mess around in night city
1609528137,"Ignore the haters, just play the game and enjoy. 10/10 would burn night city anytime."
1609528090,It was good
1609528083,"Starting issues but ...this is an exellent game
"
1609528052,It's the best Far Cry Game out there. You really have to be patient with this game as it crashes more than any game I've ever had and that includes a heavily modded skyrim. My Specs are godly and still sometimes when the battles get too hectic the game will Flatline. So you'll get familiar with quicksaves real fast.
1609527895,"First time reviewing a game after putting in close to 200 hours. I built my PC at end of 2019 thinking this could be future proof for games like cyberpunk 2077. Boy was i wrong, even with 2080 at 1440p i had to turn a bunch of feature off, shadow on medium, Ray tracing at medium and such to run the game near 40-50 fps. During launch it was even more awful but luckily the patches made it even better. Since December 9th til now i would say the game just keeps running smoother and smoother as i feel like with every patch the game is getting exponentially better in the sense it's running smoother.

This game is probably the most immersive game i've ever played, the way the characters looks at you makes you feel like you're there not as V but as yourself. This will be my 3rd play through to experience all 3 different selection although i am disappointed after 30-45 mins you're pretty much all at the same spot as many reviewers have said.

The way you can level up your character is massive in this game. Did you want to run around super quick and melee everyone to death before they can even react? Yes you can play it that way. Did you want to quickhack everyone to death before you even enter the building? Easily done. Did you want to be a stealth janitor worker and dump every body into a bin and stealth the whole mission? Sure thing. Are you the type to just go guns glazing? They got just the perks and right stats for it. However way you play, in my opinion 1 play through is almost not enough.

That being said there are negatives to this game. The launch was awful and i was running constantly between 20-50 fps where 30-40 fps was the norm which took away that immersion aspect. I also noticed that i had to validate my game once or twice and it seemed like 2 files were corrupted causing my game to not run optimally. Ever since i re-downloaded the 2 corrupted files my game has never dipped below 45 fps now. I still get the occasional T-poses from NPC or me standing on my bike which is hilarious but i know for some is a deal breaker. At its current state unless you have a good PC it's almost unplayable and as such destroys the very reason why this game made me love it so much, the immersive gameplay.

This game was meant for a beefed up PC and in my honest opinion worth investing for a good pc for. I plan on buying a RTX 3080 in the future when it's available to run this game on max on whatever play through i'll be when i do upgrade. However if building a more powerful PC isn't an option, i would advise to not buy this game until later on once the devs have time to optimize it even more. I remember playing destiny 2 on my GTX 670 on medium/low setting going this game is pretty but often choppy then playing it again on my RTX 2080 going holy crap this is a game changer. Likewise if you make the choice to upgrade your PC you can experience the same thing i did with cyberpunk 2077. Prior to building my PC in 2019 my rig was from 2009 besides the upgrade to 670 a few years down the line."
1609527892,Amazing
1609527849,"For all its faults, its still pretty fun. A few game breaking bugs wont stop me, I bought New Vegas at launch!"
1609527830,"Got the game because I love the studio. Saw they were doing refunds, so I figured it was worth taking a chance. Got stuck in a mission where you need to talk to Jackie, but Jackie didn't come out of the building. Loaded and earlier save and replayed the mission. Jackie is still inside the building and I can't continue. Loaded an even earlier save, and replayed a few days worth of gaming. STILL SAME RESULT. Ask for my refund, and they told me to go f*** myself, I played too long. F*** steam, F*** CD Projekt Red, and F*** this broke a** game."
1609527756,If you enjoy the theme of Cyberpunk you will get your money out of this game.
1609527753,Trash. do not buy
1609527720,It falls short in all except for story and music and art design. For a true next gen feeling game I would try kingdom come deliverance or breath of the wild maybe. This feels like the witcher 3 just a couple years older. That being said almost every system in the game is broken at its core. Very sad.
1609527656,"To much to say about the game, since i'm lazy to type it all, i'll link BeatEmUps youtube video. He made one of the best reviews on the game I've seen, completely agree with everything he said:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CymqHdNYkg

 It had everything to be a good game but failed completely (you can see it was due to poor top management) and trust me i put +100h's into the game to see if I would change my mind."
1609527575,"Game is awesome. 60+ hours so far. Good story, amazing world.

There are some QOL things that could and should be improved. Civ AI is mediocre."
1609527515,Game is really good if you have a 3080 like I do.
1609527485,"it is just ok game. standard single player game: go here, shoot guys, go there then shoot some more guys"
1609527365,"So buggy and empty game that I want my money back, 3/10"
1609527220,"A beautifully made RPG that has a captivating story, mind blowing graphics (if you have a GPU to match it's beastly needs), motivating skill trees, and side quests that actually aren't boring! The unique futuristic ideas and implementations make it a refreshing experience over the other 2020 releases that mostly seemed liked washed out let downs. Overall I recommend this one to any RPG lover! Well worth my $$."
1609527019,The gunplay and gun animations are about the only thing that is well done in this game.
1609526997,Bad.
1609526987,"I never saw any trailers or game play. I only knew that John Wick was in this and that it was hyped to an insane amount. 

I loved this game. I played one play through with every gig/side mission complete. It took me about 125 hours. 

Upon seeing the trailers/game play presentations, I felt a little sad that a lot of things that were shown did not end up in the game. The story choices and life paths seemed overplayed as well. 

Overall, expecting nothing from this game was amazing. The Combat starts off slow and clunky but a tangible improvement is felt when upgrading. The story of a futile effort to save your own life was great. The world is amazing looking and is rich with lore. 

However, now that I know what the expectations for this game were, I leave a little disappointed. I was more than satisfied before viewing promotional footage. Now I am feeling a little jaded and feel like there could have been so much more."
1609526944,is good
1609526899,"Not as buggy as early reviews and media made it out to be. Glad I decided to purchase it after all, looking forward to future patches and DLC with added things to do! So far the storyline and gameplay are solid."
1609526862,The game is buggy and can be hard to get to run but after some time testing settings and troubleshooting issues the game is a lot of fun with a great story. there are definitely things that still need to be fixed but on PC the game is playable and fun.
1609526838,Good backbone hope it actually gets finished.
1609527118,"Almost 170 hours played, that should tell you exactly what I think. Even with ALL the bugs or glitches (and not having the setup to play at max settings) this is still EASILY my favorite game since the Witcher 3. There are so many meaningful NPCs that really make you care for them, you get invested in their lives and want to help them. The combat is the MOST FUN I've had in first person combat for a LONG time as well. The variety of weapons, cyberware, clothes was great and the crafting/upgrading system along with the ""Iconic"" items was a blast. The Stat point and perk point leveling system was extremely engaging to the point that I'd spend a lot of time just reading all the perks effects and planning what perks I wanted to avoid.

You will not be dissapointed with this game and its literally getting better every day/hotfix

My only major gripes would be that they need to fix the throwing knives perk and they need to add a ""mass crafting option"" for crafting multiple copies of the same item at once.

Don't be a gonk and listen to your choom, you wont regret it <3"
1609526618,the story and characters are great you just gotta get past the bugs
1609526560,very fun game and great story line
1609526559,"Even if there some bugs and stuff.. The story is amazed me soo much. So sad to see that it finished, i could've done more and more side-quests and maybe more longer main quest line.. Not complaining but i mean that was a heluva experience and journey.. Thanks for everything CD Project for this really nice game. Let me cry in that corner because my journey ended in Night City."
1609526548,"Pretty good game - reminds me a lot of a mixture of Hitman and GTA5.  Some obvious bugs, but on the PC, they aren't game-breaking or overly distracting.  Great story so far."
1609526543,"I have a decent number of hours in this game now (add 50 for offline untracked time) so I feel comfortable putting my overlong review here

tldr: 7\10 from someone oblivious to the hype, dont buy it for open world rpg shooter as i did, buy it for humor and story. and potential in patches and dlcs

I LOVE open world games, I'm a fan of rpg style shooters. I decided to get this game based on recommendations not by any hype or trailers that i had seen, because its an open world rpg style shooter. 

My main selling points are IMO the most poorly done parts of this game. I enjoyed the story and the humor enough to counteract the IMO shoddy world and weak combat/progression systems.

The game is hilarious even the dialog of random gang members is great, the story was good even though the opening felt generic and rushed the rest and the end especially were definitely high quality.

BUGS, it has um, people hate um, I played oblivion and skyrim when they were new, then played modded versions of those games, so this is a shiny clean game in comparison and i'm not bothered at all. HOWEVER there are a few that would be nice to know about before committing to a playstyle, i actually dropped 2 playthroughs with about 40 hours between them when i came upon not game breaking but very obnoxious and potentially build crippling bugs

all in all i had fun but not how i thought i would. im glad i didnt get onto the hype train and was able to enjoy what i found instead of what i expected

...

also cars suck motorcycles are infinitely better"
1609526450,"Enjoyable game.  After the 1.05 and 1.06 patches, most of my game crashes were resolved.  I really enjoyed all the side quests and stories that went along with them.  Totally a worthwhile game purchase."
1609526266,I like it.
1609526215,"Yeah its very good,just make sure you have a pc that can run it,the bugs were insignificant for me and I really enjoyed it"
1609526190,"32 hours in. Enjoying it a lot. Haven't noticed much in the way of bugs or glitches. The game isn't ""Witcher 3"" quality and depth, which was a let-down, but it's still the best RPG I've played so far this year and one that I plan on finishing given how much I'm enjoying it."
1609526052,keanu. 'nuff said.
1609526043,Immersive experience with an interesting story line.
1609525807,"Yes it has some bugs but overall the game it self is an amazing game, I would STRONGLY recommend this game. take the time to learn all you can do the driving could use some improvement but that is really all i can complain about and a few bugs here and there but i would buy the game again at full price. Forget what you have read about the game and try it for yourself."
1609525773,"The game is without soul, loads of glitches and bugs, the mighty night city is totally empty..basically nothing to do while not doing gigs or missions which feels clunky and boring. I wonder if the devs have heard about GTA V ...so much better on all levels. The driving in Cyberpunk is horrible, you fly over cars if they are superlow, cars get stuck on small stones or concrete, the animation for closing the door always is so slow and useless, Unable to exit car fast like on any other game. the menus are not so good either, the car GPS is just stupid. NPC's has no content what so ever. I can kill lots of ppl and then lose the cops driving 1 block. all that loot you pick up its crazy, for no use at all. Its a nice river flowing in the city, you can swim but there are no boats or anything to explore. the exploration level really sucks, which is really the thing in these open world games, no random events nothing to stumble upon. man I really hope CD RED get their shit together and patch everything real soon. I've played 30 hours just to try to like it, but its soo boring. don't even know why Im doing these mission, is there a point? I'm sad. Anyone else feeling this?"
1609525763,10/10 would get Keanu Reeves stuck inside my skull again.
1609525719,"I got the bad ending, also made johnny boy mad. all in all, pretty good game, just got to find a new one now."
1609525679,"Solid story, maybe a bit short, wonderful characters, fun gunplay. Needs some polishing up and fixing and the game would be truly awesome"
1609525495,A fun game
1609525485,future is here
1609525471,One of my most disappointing game i ever purchased. Played almost 68 hours and had to dropped it. I didn't even finish the main story because it's too boring and shallow. If CDPR will restored cut contents such as 3rd person cut scenes etc. on the future maybe i revisited it and they will have my benefit of the doubt. For now i lose trust from this company. If you wanna play Cyberpunk game Deus Ex franchises is better cyberpunk game than this. Avoid this game for now. Don't buy it on full price.
1609525369,"I have always been a fan of the genre having read and watched much hard SciFi.  Very disappointed over the game's delays, but ultimately satisfied with the results.  Game is not perfect, but clearly an act of passion.  Trying not to rush through it, I have chosen an initial path of stealth.  Some initial missions proved too challenging for a purely stealth approach for which I had to break out the stolen guns.  All in all, I am a big fan and encourage all to check out the vids on twitch to see for yourself..."
1609525362,"Although buggy, unoptimized game it is very enjoyable and nice."
1609525281,Amazing Game with a story that draws you in Night City and makes you feel like you are there and are a part of the adventure and action! Best Game Of All Time.
1609525734,"First of all, I really did enjoy my time playing Cyberpunk 2077 beyond the obvious bugs and glitches. I still enjoyed the game for what it was and i'm glad I didn't experience any game crashes.

However, I cannot recommend this game, not only because of the many bugs present (January 1st 2021) but also how the game was marketed in trailers and all and at the end, certain aspect of the game are just not fully representitve in the actual game.

I played as a Male V StreetKid, and it took me around 80 hours to completed the main quest, all the side quests and all small open world missions that I am aware of. 

Goods :

- Amazing World Building and distinctive/edgy Art Direction
- Overall Great Soundtracks, especially during gun fights 
- Believable Story and lovable Characters with great dialogue choices


Bads :

-Gameplay Loop is WAY too much repetitive, especially sides quest in the open world
-Combat Brawling never felt good. Gunfights felt Okay
- Character Customization (The wearing that you find in the open world never made my character looked cool. Most of the time, He looked out of style and no NPC seems to care/react to what I'm wearing and the car i'm driving. Also, the genitals customization felt useless since it never serves anything in the game and during adult scenes)
- Driving felt bad at first, but once you understand how it works, it felt okay to drive around.
- Poor inventory management (really feel tedious to navigate around, and the hundreds of food you can buy and get in the open world feel either intimidating to choose in your inventory and feel insignificant in gameplay)


My disappointment

- Relationship system felt extremely poor and not present at all in the open-world gameplay. Once you complete the story of the character you've bonded with, there's nothing else you can do with them (''except at the very end of the game''). Just giving a gun as a reward when you finish their story felt cheap and I wish we could do more in terms of gameplay in the open world with them. Once you finished their main quest, it's DONE. They only send you few text messages afterward but this doesn't make a great game experience in my opinion.

Also, in this kind of game, the player should never be unable to bond romantically with whoever he wants to because of ''sexual orientation'' reasons.  I know this is not how life works but it's still a video game.



Final Thoughts

I definitely felt satisfied when the game ended and I was overall happy with my experience. Beyond the problems I mentioned, the world, the story, and how the characters are portraits in the game are what sold me in this game. If you seem to feel the same and didn't buy the game yet, I would recommend waiting until the game is full patched for a more definitive version of Cyberpunk 2077."
1609525204,The devs really outdid themselves with the hacking. I love the unique ability to reduce the gameplay to 13FPS whenever im fighting someone
1609525023,"This game has its ups; unique characters, fun references, Judy & Panam, a great sound track, and phenomenal premises.

This game has its downs; Spotty acting, bugs, and lack of thoroughly cohesive and extensive content. 

All in all, I do recommend this game."
1609524976,Game is great and thats that.
1609524932,With a little polish it hands down lives up to the hype but be warned it requires a powerful machine for it to shine.
1609524925,Its not the god game among games but it is honestly fun and overall enjoyable. Anyone that deems this game crap just doesn't like single player games.
1609524914,There are some issues however I would still buy it again and play it. Cyberpunk 2077 is still a lot of fun! The graphics are amazing!
1609524840,"honestly, i love this game the feeling i get from the story alone is something that i feel actually leaves a mark on my day, this is a game i look forward to playing every moment i get to, its something that should be looked at as a public project, a game where the people who voice there opinions in the way that allows room for growth and development instead of hatred and bad reviews, a game like this is something that we need right now, something that we can pour all of our missing elements of life that we feel can be ported into a digital world, this is an amazing outlet for that, with the technical capability and peoples will power to make more, i believe this game, much like many other long running fan favorite games, just needs time and support to make it a true masterpiece!"
1609524787,incredible game!!!!
1609524716,"Now I felt so bad for those didn't get to experience the game with capable hardwares and for those who rushed the game within 20 hours.


A thing of beauty, I know,
Will never fade away."
1609524693,"Cyberpunk 2077 is among the buggiest games I’ve ever played, and is right up there with Bethesda games. I’ve seen T-posing, quest scripts not working, UI elements disappearing on load, controller sensitivity changing with the DLSS setting, and invisible objects with the first few hours. I'm going to wait until all these issues are patched."
1609524648,nice game
1609524565,"after 26 hours, I am just bored..."
1609524420,"I very rarely buy games on release. Especially hyped ones like Cyberpunk. For some reason though, I decided I wanted to be a part of the release of this one. I bought it, pre-loaded it, and started playing the very first moment I could. I happened to have a week off, and I had set aside all that time for this game.

I read as little as possible about games and movies before experiencing them myself. I want to know as little as possible. The result in this case was that I knew CD Project Red was behind it, I had seen the poster, so I kind of figured it was some kind of sci-fi future setting, and I had caught a glimpse of Keanu Reeves possibly being in the game. I knew nothing else. Having really enjoyed Witcher 3, I figured this might be that but in another setting. I even expected a third-person view. That’s how little I knew about this game.

So I jump in with this expectation to be blown away. That’s a high bar to clear, I know, but the hype being what it was, maybe it’s hard to not have high expectations. Did it clear the bar? No. And no, it’s not because it’s glitchy. It’s pretty much entirely due to story and overall game design.

But let’s start off with the good stuff. The game is very, very good looking. You can tell that the developers have put a lot of time in designing night city, the vehicles in it, and the overall graphical profile of the game. I like how weapons are designed. Not to mention the graphic quality, especially on an RTX card. But for me, the good stuff sort of stops there.

Keeping this review spoiler free, I’m not going to mention specific story points, but rather give a description of how I feel about the writing and pacing.

To keep it simple - I don’t buy it. The characters, how people talk, how that society is functioning. I don’t find it believable. To be blunt - I picture a bunch of young boys writing the script, and trying so hard to make it sound cool. The slang they’ve made up for this world, the criminal masterminds. Every single interaction with other characters I was in, broke the immersion for me. I was reminded I was playing a video game that someone else had written all the time. On top of that I found a lot of voice actors lacking. Not all - some are right out splendid - but others, like the male voice of V, is terrible. Once again, trying so hard to be bad ass that I immediately get reminded of the fact that I’m sitting behind a computer screen.

The second part to why I don’t like the writing is that I am constantly bored. Every dialogue was so slow, and I couldn’t put my finger on why. I’m not a person demanding action all the time, far from it, I’d say I prefer slow things. But slow is not the problem here - boring is. They talk and talk, and get nowhere. They just throw cool terms and slang around, and at the end of the conversation (I’m sorry, “convo”), I’m supposed to have learned some new information, but all I really could pick up was a bunch of bull. 

The result of all this is zero investment in the story. I’ve really tried getting into it, figuring out what it is about, but I just can’t. I hear words, and then I get a point marked on the map. Apparently that’s where I’m going next.

So, the story is bugging me, but is the game any fun? I mean, it’s an open world game with tons of things to do. I hear people telling me, at least. My perception is just chaos. You start the game off with a little introduction, and then you’re free to roam night city. You open the map, and oh lord. It’s just crammed with stuff. As you move around, random people call you out of nowhere, giving you jobs. Marker after marker just ends up on your map, and I have no way of telling what all this is. I can’t remember anything about half of them, who gave me the mission, or why.

I sit back and remember Witcher 3. A game where side-missions sometimes had a more engaging story than the main one, where a simple farmer somewhere had more character than Geralt himself, and where you got invested in simple folk. Or Red Dead Redemption 2, where you could stumble upon a drifter, sitting drunk in the middle of the forest, calling you in to tell you his life story before falling asleep. Then suddenly I’m back in Night City, where it’s just complete chaos, and nothing makes sense, and I don’t give a shit about a single person in this world. Not even the main character. It’s just too much, and it’s too damn shallow. 

I wanted to like this game so bad. I remember being sort of mad at people who said the story in RDR2 sucked, because I loved that game. But if this is what they felt playing it, I get it now. It’s just not for me. That makes me sad.

At the time of this review I have yet to finish the game. I’ve given it several tries, going in to get through the main story at least, but I can feel the joy of gaming fading from me, and I have to stop. Maybe one day I’ll know how the story ends. Or what it’s about. Or why I should care. But not today.
"
1609524395,"wow , it is the game of the year
"
1609524384,"It has it's issues but there's so much good here that I can forgive them for being pressured to release before it was really ready. CDPR have already fixed many of the issues and if past experience is anything to go by, they wont rest until the game is perfect."
1609524341,"In terms of gameplay, lore and all the interesting stuff, its an amazing game. Although optimization is lacking and bugs are annoying sometimes."
1609524738,"It's a mix of Witcher 3 and Sleeping Dogs. NOT GTA.

If you go into this with realistic expectations Cyberpunk will be utterly amazing, both visually as well as storywise.

The world is fantastic and very unique. You can get easily lost in the sheer amount of detail that is put into it.
Not all sidemissions reach the standard that witcher3 achieved, but they are still amazing. I cannot stress enough how beautiful this game looks even without Ray tracing.

There are aspects that can be improved upon such as:
- police chases
The police AI is basic at best and the spawning out of thin air ruins this aspect of the game. This definitely needs work.

- more customizabilty regarding outfits and weapons
As of now it is similar to witcher, where most of the outfits don't look appealing. The crafting system does not allow you to change the skin of your weapon or clothing, even though there are many different versions out there. I'd really wish for more unique clothing sets, similar to the different witcher schools armor sets. As of now you cant change the look of your character once it has been set in the character creation. I really hope future DLC's will improve on this.

- driving experience
Cars tend to heavily oversteer in this game. This can be fun at times when you manage to drift through corners, but its quite hard to master. Driving long distances is almost impossible without crashing into something. Offroad cars with all-wheel-drive are easier to drive on the road than the expensive hyper cars.
The minimap stays zoomed in while driving, which leads to missing turns and highway exits. This needs to be fixed asap.

- bugs
while there have been a few small bugs during my playthrough (almost 90 hours at the time of writing) almost none of them were major in any way (appart from 2 occasions). Almost all of them can be fixed by saving and reloading to get rid of it. I really don't understand how people seemingly have so many issues with the game. If you update your graphic card drivers and have a reasonable system to play this game, the experience seems absolutley fine to me. My 3 year old PC (GPU: GTX 1080 TI; CPU: 8700 K) can handle Cyberpunk quite well.

Overall the positive aspects far outweigh the negatives in my opinion. I'd rarely commend games at full price but 60,- € on release is more than fair for a game like Cyberpunk. Feel free to wait until CDPR fixes the remaining flaws and polishes the game, but don't skip on this gem because of negative reviews due to unrealistic expectations."
1609525685,"Don't even get me started on how badly optimized the game is. 
This is honestly almost nothing that was promised and is really an empty shell of an ""open world RPG"".
I didn't have overall much expectations because I didn't want to watch any videos and wanted to single handedly experience it on my own and this just doesn't have ""it"". 
Even Fallout 4 had deeper rpg choices than this, which is saying alot.

-your starting lifepaths basically means nothing but a few changed lines in the game other than the start
-police and cars appear from thin air when you look behind, like it's the year 2004
-combat AI is truly awful
-there is not much at all to do in the city other than quests; no barbers, no tattoo parlors, no way to change appearance after you've made your character.
-some of the animations are truly questionable

Although the story elements are top notch and the writing is good and Keanu Reeves' character is awesome, it's just that the gameplay feels very shallow and the game feels completely rushed overall.

Truly a bizarre experience from a company that made The Witcher 3.
Maybe give it a few months and buy it from a sale, not worth the full money."
1609524114,girl can have peewee
1609524106,"Despite all the negativity surrounding the release of this game (after waiting 6 months for it to actually release), it played flawlessly for me. I was able to complete the game in about 40+ hours with little to no glitches. The overall storyline with multiple endings was great, and the whole environment was very immersive."
1609524049,"Good game bad bug enjoy taste texture 8,5/10"
1609524028,yes
1609524015,"It's a looter shooter combined with a story. Much story.
Also, it's pretty."
1609523989,amount of bugs is insane
1609523983,"Not even close to done.  You can tell they rushed the production in the end.  Graphics quality and issues appear further into the story.  Too many dead ends in the streets and alleys.  Cars halfway spawned in the street.  25 bucks yes.  60 no... Driving sucks, just...Needs another year of coding easy."
1609523978,seen a few bugs but im having a blast and the story is great. really fleshed out characters. cant wait to play it in VR with vorpx (currently upgrading my system to handle the frames better in VR)
1609523956,"someone help, i just want to play the game but i get maybe 5 mins of game play before it crashes. i had one day where i was able to actually play it, and it did this for no reason.
"
1609523925,"First off, this game isn't what I'd call ground breaking.  On PC graphics are good, not stunning.  Overall game atmosphere is shallow – it looks amazing from a distance, on closer inspection not much beyond atmosphere appearance to a lot of it (giant beautiful buildings with no functioning doors, huge amounts of city atmosphere random NPCs that don’t interact almost at all, etc..).  There are plenty of odd little bugs/glitches that pop up.  The lack of 3rd person character view option is a missed opportunity. If one is expecting a whole new kind of video game experience that is a generation ahead of previous RPG games - this isn't it.

Now all of that being said, I have loved this game.  The pinnacle of it is the main story line quests and characters.  Once again CD Projekt has created an RPG involving good story telling strengthened by masterwork primary NPC development.  For any Roll playing game lover who enjoys developing care and attachment to characters, this is every bit as strong as the Witcher games.  The way CD Projekt is able to get players bonding to characters in the game and then use that attachment to make the events of the game play story more intense… no other company in the video game realm does as good of a job.

If you like the “roll play” part of roll playing video games, I think you will find a lot to love in this game.

If you like the open world random encounter exploration in video games, I think you will find a lot to like in this game. 

If you like the crafting, customizing, and developing your character’s resources in RPG games (housing, cars, weapons, etc…) you will likely be disappointed.

If you are looking for a newer, more rated NC-17 version of Grand Theft Auto, you will likely be disappointed.
"
1609523784,Awsome Game. Don't mind the bugs.
1609523768,"Pretty fun, despite all the stuff people didn't like about this game initially i've had a fun time playing it so far"
1609523736,"Fantastic Witcher style RPG but in the Cyberpunk universe. Tons of different story choices, play styles, and upgrade paths available that really make everyone's experience unique. 

You do need a powerful PC to run it. I'd recommend no less then 6 cores/threads for CPU and an RTX gpu in order to take advantage of DLSS. With that, the bugs are very minimal. Most of them have been patched by anyways."
1609523662,GOTY
1609523553,There is a lot of hate. I wouldn't say it lived up to the hype but i've been having a blast with this. On my 2nd play through.
1609523538,Great game. The haters wanted the next GTA5
1609523469,"WAIT FOR THE GAME TO BE FIXED

I finally finished the game after a thorough playthrough, and I really enjoyed it. I really liked the setting, story, and characters. Voice acting was mostly great (except Johnny Silverhand, a recording booth is clearly not Keanu Reeve's natural element), world building was excellent. Gameplay was decent, but nothing groundbreaking.

But holy shit this was Bethesda level of bugginess. Graphical glitches, bugged quests, the whole 9 yards.

It's worth noting that I went into Cyberpunk 2077 blind, I haven't even watched any trailers or teasers, which means I wasn't aware of any advertised content or features being cut from the launch version. All in all I'd say it was a good game, but I expected more from a CDPR title, especially after playing The Witcher 3. No king rules forever, I suppose."
1609523403,Horrible game. Such a disappoinment.
1609523359,"It's buggy as hell, the quests are your typical, industry standard tasks and there's pretty much nothing new in terms of mechanics. But I can't deny that I had a blast by having someone watch me play and cracking jokes between us."
1609523354,Needs Polishing. The AI only have like 30 models for the game to use and when you run down the street you see the same person teleport in front of you. another issue similar to this is when you have a NCPD bounty placed on you the game just seems to spawn the enemy AI next to you in rooms that cant be accessed unless the game teleport's them there. Personally I find this to be irritating. An example would be in on a roof and get a bounty placed on me i can look around the roof and no one is there. after the bounty has been placed for 5 seconds or so NCPD will be spawned 5 feet behind me with no warning. they just pop up on my mini map.
1609523216,Plays great for a game that was pushed to release early. 120 hours in and at least another 40 worth of content. Can't wait to see what is added/improved down the line.

1609522859,Amazing graphics and storyline
1609522830,"buggy, but  a lot of fun and great story, both main and side quests, be sure to read all the computers and shards, contains majority of interlocking back stories"
1609522763,"After a long wait we finally have it! I love this game, it does have its bugs and issues, but they are patching and trying to stay on top of it. It is a beautiful game, the gameplay is fun and can be challenging and the story is enthralling."
1609522718,"Yes, it has bugs.
Yes, it's a system destroyer performance-wise.

Even on a 4th Generation Intel i7 quad core and an RTX 2070 Super, I have been enjoying the heck out of it with ray tracing on, at 1440p.  I go back and forth between being CPU and GPU limited for performance depending on the scene, and anywhere from 35-60fps.   With a variable refresh rate monitor, the experience is still great.

Lots of odd AI / physics bugs, but none that have broken anything so far."
1609522658,keanu sex scene 10/10
1609522651,"Rough around the edges, a bit buggy, and generally unpolished. 
Just like its predecessor the Witcher 3 upon its release.
On the other (imo more important) hand, the writing is very good, the story is satisfying, the gunplay is solid and despite not being as deep an RP as say New Vegas, it still satisfies my craving for freedom of choice. 
If you're looking for ""Future GTA"", look else where. 
If you're looking for ""Future Witcher"", this is much closer.
"
1609522649,"You should definitely play the game if you'd like to play a mix of Witcher 3 and GTA 5 with great non-linear story and freedom of play the game your way.

The nice mechanics from previous Red Engine versions are present and work flawlessly: tracking / looking for clues using extended vision, calling your ride, upgrading gear.

However, transport handling could be a bit more realistic and there is not enough romance options (and the existing ones only pop at certain scripted moments – this is not a relationship sim). During related quests characters feel real enough, otherwise they have a few simple responses (in that regard Witcher felt more alive).

If you like comparisons, the storytelling in general is level of New Vegas and the ending feels similar to Dying Light in some sense (choose what to lose). Bittersweet...

The balance is decent. You can scratch up a sum to buy any gear available still have to earn those by completing gigs or fighting gangs.

At this stage the game has enough bugs but they are not game breaking anymore.

Waiting for DLCs to continue the adventure..."
1609522636,10/10 would recommend
1609522508,"I love the 'feel' & style of cyberpunk and how it is created in this game.  I'm running a gtx 1080 and it runs great at 1440p!  The combat is super fun, the graphics are tits, the story is pretty good (a bit of a stretch at times but I like it).  Overall Cyberpunk met all my expectations and has been a blast to play!"
1609522479,breathtakingly beautiful
1609522460,"It feels like a mash up of Fallout 4 and GTA V. It's been an enjoyable, gritty ride. Bugs still need to be addressed, but for the most part, at this point I feel it's playable and enjoyable, as long as the odd graphical glitch or bug won't put you off."
1609522438,If you are a fan of the role playing game you will love this version
1609522395,"I love this Jankey game! I hope they will continue to polish it up in future ""Hot Fix"" updates. 
Let's face it, CP 2077 is GTA-V, Skyrim & Fallout-4 all in one.  And if you love those games as I do, then this is for you.
Here are some examples:
 - Fallout-4 = Yes! this too has cars that randomly fall out of the sky.
 - Skyrim & Fallout-4 = Weapons & Armor that you can upgrade along with Attribute & Perk trees. 
 - GTA-5 = Pedestrians that go out of their way to ""magically"" jump right in front of you & Vehicles that speed up or slow down to do the same. 
But in the end, the missions are great and the graphic details are incredible. If you have the PC rig to run it in Ultra, I suggest you do so."
1609522335,"What a great game with amazing visuals and characters that's held back by unbelievably, numerous amounts of bugs and missing/cut content."
1609522327,epic game :)
1609522293,"Full of bugs but I love it.
Will return for DLCs and in 2-3 years when major bugs will be polished.
Also will return when I get my hands on 3090 RTX."
1609521914,Good game
1609521882,"Well worth the money and time. The levelling trees are fantastic and it really changes playstyle. A++, fun as heck.

Disappointed your choices don't seem to matter. Not that it matters, ironically, the game is just damn fun."
1609521853,One of the best games ive ever played
1609521750,love this game
1609521727,"Yes it is buggy, but I haven't found anything game breaking and every other part of the game is fantastic."
1609521693,"If you avoid all the quests and just run around like GTA then its slightly Enjoyable.
Most Main story line quests dont finish correctly or at all due to bugs/glitches, especially the braindances.
Its Just not a finished product and not nearly worth its pricetag at all.
If you made it $20 and called it beta it wouldnt be such a dumpster fire"
1609521630,"The game has a lot of potential, but the bugs are too much , even with 3 patches still too buggy, Do not buy !"
1609521610,Excellent game on PC
1609521496,"I love it.  despite the glitches, which will be fixed I'm confident, this game is amazing.  It's unique and fun, has great stories and is everything I expected from CDPR."
1609521397,Its great. Ignore the haters.
1609521392,Fun game to play if you have a high end PC. Not sure how well it will run on lower end systems considering consoles have had a horrible experience.
1609521345,"Great game, needs a few more updates but it is worth it thus far."
1609521300,The story is deep and engaging.. I frequently forget how long I've been playing only to realize how late it is! really sucked me in!
1609521273,Funny but fun
1609521259,"Excellent game. Brings the cyberpunk straight to your face mostly in the way I have pictured it in my mind. The immersion of the game is there as well. Sure it has some bugs and I've managed to crash maybe 3 times during the 45 hours of playing. I had the benefit of not reading or watching any hype during the years of development and just jumped in while on vacation so I didn't have that burden, Also I haven't read or watched the negative reviews after they published the game.  

Good game."
1609521149,A way to much bugs
1609521098,🖤
1609521086,"One thing i can say without a doubt is that the game story is truly wonderful, exciting, moving and crazy fun... lost myself and pull 55 hours even with the bugs, glitches, errors. I highly suggest getting the game just to get involved in the story. I forgive the bugs however it does take you out of the experience although the game story is a sold 8/10."
1609521039,I waited a couple weeks after release before purchasing to allow time for hotfixes. Thus far the number of bugs I've encountered has been minimal and only visual. Overall I've quite enjoyed the game.
1609521033,10 багов из 10
1609520961,"PC is technically the best platform to play it as it suffers least from performance issues. It is still far from what I have expected, but as a game - worth it. It's above OK. Saddens when it glitches, but entertains when it doesn't. I still find unfinished places in the game where a developer might have said ""Naaahh.. it'll be fine. Changed nothing, no revolution there, but an adequate game. Far worse games got a pass in the past, but I held CD Project to higher standards and I'll be more careful with their upcoming games in the future."
1609520956,Anyone crying about this game on PC is out of their mind. Ignore the the libs..
1609520895,good but buggy
1609520892,Has its moments but overall a good game
1609520864,Nice game but you need to have very good PC
1609520833,"Some bugs and teething issues, but for the most part I have really enjoyed the game, definitely a must for RPG players."
1609520790,So much FUN !!! But still a lot of bug V1.06
1609520783,"solid game, witcher still better imo"
1609520741,"over hyped to the max
single player game
single install game
single playthru game
single uninstall game

i rate the game 6 out of 10 why? i have played it for 50+ hours and enjoying it. why? it has bugs such as but not limited to dying to stairs, random shit floating etc, ignoring that, The story is o,k but i do not see myself playing thru the game more then once, the side missions are ""kill all and click"" or ""kill all and escort"" snore... ymmv. worth full retail? nope wait for sale.

if your ""beast"" of a machine is outdated or your inept with basic pc tasks such as installing drivers, choosing install location to ssd etc. Do not bother buying cyberpunk for pc. go buy a latest gen console peasant."
1609520598,Awesome despite the bugs.
1609520596,Fun game on PC
1609520581,Just started gaming on PC and my first game was cyber punk! Completely blown away by the game! 10/10!
1609520565,It's the year 2077 and elevators are slower than ever. I spent half my playtime waiting in an elevator.
1609520525,"It's got some bugs, most of which are solved by a Quicksave and reload, and I can't comment on consoles because I'm a PC guy, but the game is good and I've enjoyed the heck out of it. 100hrs for CA$80 isn't a bad deal so I feel like I got my money's worth.
I will say I'm disappointed in the endings, not because of the story part (no spoilers) but because none of them feel like you're playing the same game that you just spent 60-70 hrs in. So I'd advise playing as much as you can before you hit the point of no return then put it down down until a few updates come.
The other disappointing thing is that I'm not getting the re-play vibe. The origins don't seem to make a bit of difference and honestly with the exception of adding a possible ending route your choices still end up pretty much the same. My guess after reading the news on what's going on it feels like some of the upcoming DLC was supposed to be in the game at start so that may change.
Anyway it's worth the money and you will enjoy it just maybe more in a few months when the DLCs start dropping."
1609520523,"Its Kinda hard for me to review Cyberpunk 2077.. but after 160h of gameplay.. i think i can drop a verdict.

With a Sad look* I love CDPR and Cyberpunk 2077.. but I don't recommend Cyberpunk 2077 at its current state =(
The game have Soul and flare in it.. but lack the execution.. overall i kinda feel CDPR kinda let me down

- Police AI kinda Stupid.. CDPR have tons of material to copy or take inspiration from.. yet this the best they can do *face palm*
- Crafting kinda lacking.. imagine crafting a grenade x 100.. you need 100 clicks. 
- World feel kinda empty.. something off with the crowd system. Imagine pointing a gun toward the crowd but the crowd just pass through you.
- No mini games.. maybe another reason why the world feel empty. Imagine if you can tune or modify your cars for drag race or any kind of race. More reason to get all those cars
- Kinda limited Romance option.. in my first run i kinda stuck with only Palmer. If you want Judy.. sorry you have to replay as female V *shrug*
- No companion or similar sort.. imagine you can call friends as companion after you bond with them.

and many more.. but if i list everything.. the listing will be TLDR haha

verdict.. i think cyberpunk 2077 need 6 months or a year in the oven."
1609520447,Good la
1609520414,"[h1]Introduction: “A colossal failure”[/h1]

I would just like to note before writing this review that CD Projekt Red have failed to meet expectations, CyberPunk 2077 is probably the worst launch a game has ever been given in history, being just as worse as Fallout 76 (how coincidental, 76 then 77). To all those who played on console, you deserve better because AAA developers are just failing badly to deliver any good experience to the consumer. Quiet frankly, it seems that the indie devs are seeing this as a massive win, because the AAA industry is pathetic at this point. 

If something is not ready, do not release it. Don’t even rush a release for Christmas because “MUH STOCK PRICES”, the irony is that CD Projekt red’s stocks tanked after the release of this game. Their stock prices are not recovering from this one and it is the dumbest business tactic in the history of finance as well, because to tank your stock prices during the pandemic could only be accomplished by idiots. Seems like Projekt red are those idiots and the short sellers got a massive dinner at the end of the day. These stocks will probably recover in the next two years.

But this is not to say anything about the gameplay itself or my experience with the game. There is no denying that the launch for Cyberpunk was atrocious and it is going to be a reminder for the future. However, the sheer stupidity seen on the internet by hyping this game up to insane levels is outrageous, as is the jump on the bandwagon haters who have not even played the game itself. The only people’s anger which is justified are those who played this game on console or are suffering technical difficulties on PC when they have a good rig (such as an RTX 2060). Anyone else who is playing on a toaster or hasn’t bought the game or looked at it is just your daily neckbeard on reddit or 4chan.

[h1]The game itself[/h1]
Cyberpunk 2077 is an immersive sim, RPG, action-adventure hybrid which takes its futuristic look on life and storyline seriously. So seriously to the point that it will go through lengths to describe every bit of technology in the world to you through characters or text logs that you will find throughout the world itself. It’s a massive game full of detail that is easy to get lost on with a ridiculous amount of side quests to complete and a massive number of decisions to make throughout the story itself. The setting is incredible, it has that same atmospheric touch that games like the original fallout (1-2), Hitman: Contracts and Max Payne 3 all share. Playing the game and seeing Night City really just throws you there with all the unique locations which the game has to offer, for instance, you could be in the Japanese town centre in the game and think you’re in Tokyo or the familiar Kamurucho (Yakuza) and next you could be in a run-down shack full of criminals. It does the setting justice and makes you want to take screenshots of how beautiful this dam game looks.

Gameplay is dependent on player choice like most RPGS, there is loads to explore in this game with many of the decisions which you make having an impact on the game’s ending as well as how story progresses throughout the game, for instance, making one choice may lock out a segment. This is good for re-playability, but it does not feel like that Deus Ex type of re-playability for one main issue and that’s the fact that Cyberpunk is just overwhelming in skills and side quests that once you play this, it’ll be a while when you want to re-play it again. I get that there are some people out there who have more spare time than myself, or there are those at university just leaving everything to the last minute to play this game for hours on end, but this is not how I decipher and replay a game. Deus Ex gets the replay formula right as its linear, cyberpunk 2077 is more open-ended. And I think this is an issue with the type of target audience it has, its for people that enjoy RPGS where they can explore everything down to the detail. It isn’t Deus Ex where your JC Denton is different each time in specialising in certain weapons and what not. There is a lot to learn and explore with this game and they’ve done a great job on detailing this thing as best as they could, its just the gameplay in this thing is dependent on whether you like to explore.

For me, I preferred exploring all the main characters that have an impact on the story, I enjoyed going through each of their side quests and what they had to offer. Its just I’m not going to go do all the other side quests which tend to get repetitive as they follow the formula of go here, kill this guy, retrieve this package, etc. But some side quests do have good writing, especially this one where you walk into an abandoned warehouse and there’s dismembered bodies everywhere, it was very atmospheric and horror-like. But for those side quests which do involve main characters, they have really dam good writing, something that CDProjekt did well with the Witcher 3, for instance the River Ward side quest in Cyberpunk 2077 is incredible. 

But where the game messes up is with all the text-logs you will pick up throughout the game. The devs at CDprojekt really should have played Sys shock 2 or Bioshock. Its common devs want to expand upon the worlds that they have developed and in a shock game you pick up an audio log and boom it expands upon the story. In Cyberpunk (and also the witcher), no one is going to read all of these text logs. This has nothing to do with enjoying reading either, I like reading books but what I don’t like reading is tedious information that has little value. Why couldn’t they just make audio logs? I don’t get it.

Another big strength of Cyberpunk is the acting and music. The only big name in this game is Keanu Reeves and he along with all the other actors did a phenomenal job in making these characters come to life. I think Cyberpunk 2077, RDR2, Bioshock and Sys shock 2 are the only games I’ve played where the actors have been top notch at performing their roles. When it comes to music, the score (OST) is phenomenal and at the end of the game there is a decision you must make and it felt very intense because of the music. However, the radio playlists are bad, there isn’t any good radio stations in this game and I found myself driving my car in silence most of the time. I just don’t like techno and rock music at all, its my two most despised music genres. It seems Rockstar are the only devs who can get radio stations in a open world game right. 

However, Cybepunk is let down by all the frustrating bugs there are in the game. This game is incredibly buggy, there are times where you need to reload saves to get rid of the bugs you experience as well. For a game that’s been in development for almost a decade, it shouldn’t have this many bugs. Also, if your pc save file exceeds 8 MB it will corrupt. Not good. But mine didn’t. 

When you look past all the bugs, this game is brilliant. It’s not the “masterpiece experience” all those neckbeards on 4chan and Reddit hyped up or hated, nor is it one of my favourites of all time (Sekiro & CrossCode kicks this games ass), but it’s a game that has a masterful story, acting and great open world. 

If you don’t want to play this game because of its price or its bugs (which are the main reasons why everyone is avoiding cyberpunk), I’d recommend RDR2, or if you’re on the low end, go play CrossCode or Hollow Knight. Just do it, don’t even question those indies. But when cyberpunk is patched and plays how it should play, you oughta try it just to see if you’ll like it or not.

1609520408,"Its a very fun game and while it currently (1/1/21) lacks a bit of polish its totally worth it. I look forward to the day that the game has its final level of polish and content adjusted, but until then I'll keep laughing at the little quirks I come across."

"
1609521096,"Cyberpunk 2077 was announced when I was still wearing diapers and eating baby food. I was 18 years old at the time. The hype surrounding this game was continuously fuelled by CDPR's promises of an immersive world and gameplay features that would flip the results of Russian elections, NPCs that literally breathe the air in your living room, a character customization so deep that random NPCs would react to a shit stain on your left buttcheek and RPG elements with so many dialogue choices that Keanu Reeves would need extensive therapy after your first interaction.

Instead we got bullet sponge combat from Borderlands, stealth from Deus Ex: Human Revolution, performance that is comparable to an infinite loop running on 5 of your 6 CPU threads and more bugs than a decrepit Brooklyn apartment. NPCs crouch in fear for an eternity when you sneeze. Omniscient police fade into existence in the middle of a desert. Vehicles permanently stop on the road waiting for invisible traffic. The city feels alive until you walk into the minimum LOD distance and cars vanish from the roads, leaving a dead husk of a promise told to us during the 2018 gameplay demo.

The entire game is a fragile and shallow illusion: NPCs don't actually drive the cars like expected in open world games. Instead, they follow a predetermined path like railway carts. This is clearly evident by the fact that the player's vehicle steering is centered on the front wheels while the NPC's vehicle steering is centered on the middle of the vehicle - they literally rotate around the axis and move along a path until they encounter an obstacle, at which point they become prime targets for the game's garbage collection system that yeets them out of existence the moment you look in the other direction. NPCs have their own unique lives and desires, such as the desire to perform magic by vanishing in front of your eyes and daily schedules consisting of walking to the end of the block, turning around and walking back. Night City really sells the feeling of late stage capitalism when its citizens feel completely indifferent to dying from explosives or having someone standing on top of their car during their daily commute.

The story was good but some characters were forgettable and felt underdeveloped. The only characters I really liked were Jackie Welles and Johnny Silverhand, one of whom is literally a cancer in your brain for the bulk of the game. Most other interesting characters are either killed off or just straight up vanish like distant traffic. Here's a breakdown of the characters you encounter in the game:

Jackie Welles - the best character in the entire game by far, and a loyal friend of the main character. 50% of the total development time went to developing this character and killing him off in the prologue.

Johnny Silverhand - the rockerboy who nuked Amazon HQ and got his brain stored on a USB stick. The entire main story revolves around him being a cancer in your brain and slowly killing you as you relive his memories of being a cunt to everyone. He eventually learns to be less of a cunt but this is ultimately up to the player's choice.

Judy Alvarez - a lesbian game dev working for a female gang making VR porn games. Gamer simps drool over her because you can have lesbian sex if you can get through her questline that revolves around overthrowing the CEO of sexism.

Panam Palmer - brash, rude and hot-headed former member of the Avocados or whatever. Their leader hates her the entire time but at the end makes her a leader too because she stole a flying tank from a corporation and helped defend them from a rival group with your help. You can't romance her as a woman so her questline ends up being completely pointless and you have nothing else to look forward to.

Adam Smasher - a terrifying monstrosity that towers over any other character in the game. This dude is more machine than human and comes equipped with a rocket launcher, hot water dispenser and espresso maker, making him a formidable opponent. You see him early in the game and immediately know you're going to have an epic boss battle with him at the end. The ""epic boss battle"" ends up being underwhelming as he's just your regular bullet sponge with rockets. His backstory is non-existent aside from Silverhand's personal history with him and a few mentions of his name. Who the fuck is this massive cyborg, how did he become so spooky and why he works for Jeff Bezos is a mystery until you exit the game and read the wiki.

Goro Takemura - personal bodyguard of Tekashi 6ix9ine. He gets framed for his employer's murder and teams up with you to bring truth to light by kidnapping his employer's daughter and trying to convince her that he didn't kill her dad. His backstory is interesting, and you get to know him well enough to feel sad when he dies. If you manage to save him like I did, he just tells you ""let's just be friends"" and ghosts you.

That aside, the art and environment is where Cyberpunk 2077 shines. The team responsible for creating assets, building the game world and polishing the atmosphere did such an amazing job that I spent the majority of my time in the game revelling in their work, parkouring around the city and sightseeing. Each district of the city truly has its own unique feel. It is a shame that much of it went to waste or used purely for background purposes. Most players will likely not scale the many residential buildings in Kabuki or manage to get outside of the map boundaries, nor will they truly feel immersed because every other aspect of the game is shallow.

I enjoyed the game but it's not what we were promised throughout the entire marketing campaign, even up until the launch. What you get is Borderlands-style bullet sponge gunplay with Deus Ex: HR stealth with hacking mechanics. If that's your cup of tea, then pick it up and you will enjoy it.

7/10; Wholesome Keanu Big Chungus 100."
1609520059,"Witcher 3 is my favorite game of all time, so I was definitely interested in this game. I tried to go in as blind as possible to avoid the hype, which I felt would lead to disappointment because so many people were hyping this up to the point where it would never live up to those ridiculous expectations. That being said, because of Witcher 3, my expectations were still pretty high. And I'll admit, the game impressed me. Night City looks and feels awesome to explore and feels like an actual metropolitan area with the high density of vehicles and people. Despite having to play on essentially low-medium settings (I will come back to this), the game looks stunning. What I think impressed me the most is the writing with the main characters. These characters feel like ordinary people, they felt real. V also feels like one of the most relatable protagonists I've ever experience just because he's just an average guy who got caught up in something he doesn't understand. The main story was a lot of fun to play through and the side quests were even better. The gameplay and RPG elements aren't anything special, but also don't hinder the experience.

Now that all that gushing is out of the way, I cannot recommend anyone buy this game in its current state. My computer is over the recommended specs and I can only run the game on medium to low settings at 1080p only managing an average framerate around 40fps, with the more dense areas running around 20-25fps. I didn't experience too many game-breaking bugs, but I think I just got lucky. I expect CDPR to fix this game, but it shouldn't have been released like this at all. So at this time I can't recommend this game until it is made not only a playable experience, but to where it's performance is in line with the minimum and recommended specs that CDPR advertised. Such a shame that a game that would likely be regarded as a masterpiece will likely always have some sort of negative reputation as a result of the atrocious and unacceptable state the game released in.
"
1609520022,"I Know everyone has been super hung on the bugs and everything else, considering the postponed release and everything we all expected a full on great 10/10 game, but putting this aside I've been one of the lucky people having almost no bugs and glitches. I loved the story so much, The characters are super amazing and drawing you into their story, it feels as if the city is actually alive and all I wanna do is just jump in there. I recommend this game so badly I'm willing to sell my soul to NC. <3 Hope this was hopeful."
1609520001,it has a few bugs still but overall great game
1609519981,
1609519941,"Well, I'm hooked. Great game. A combination of fallout,Grand Theft Auto, Assassins Creed, on steroids.  Some glitches but minor compared to the grand scale of this game and none that make it unplayable. A serious leap in immersive gaming. Bravo!"
1609519833,Despite a few hiccups the game is still enjoyable.
1609519794,"Good story, good game."
1609519748,"Pros:
* The story and the way it's told to you
* Cool Easter eggs
* Attention to detail
* Aesthetic. 
* Sense of humor
* Vehicle design
* Soundtrack

Cons:
* Don't like some of the mechanics for example that you are forced to get no more than a step away from the vehicle and point your view exactly to the door to be able to get inside.
* No in vehicle cop pursuit
* NPC variety and behavior  (Rockstar really spoiled us with that)

Buggs are a different story. As of 1.06 patch they still break immersion way too often for me to be able to seamlessly enjoy this awesome carefully crafted story. 
I can see what this game wants to be and I love that, it's just not there yet (so far at least). I do recommend this game, but waiting for more stable version would not be a bad idea."
1609519747,Brilliant game but very much not finished. If you zoom in even slightly you can see the staples and duct tape barely holding it all together. I will review again in 6 months if and when it's working properly.
1609519937,"Game is extremely buggy, unpolished, and half baked. But it still manages to be great fun, so I have high hopes for it in the future. Despite the lifeless NPCs, Night city is gorgeous and a joy to explore. Combat is also fun, even though enemy AI is severely lacking. I set the difficulty to Hard and chopped people up with my katana in slow motion. Fun times.
The main story is short and sweet, with multiple different endings. Side quests are fun and abundant.
 The bugs can be nasty, I encountered: visual bugs like flickering lights, physics bugs like randomly getting hauled 300 meter into the air, dialogue bugs where I couldnt't finish the dialogue, quest bugs where I couldn't progress the quest, audio bugs of sound effects that loop repeatedly.. I had to restart a lot. 

My recommendation: buy if you're starved for a good game, wait if you can, so the bugs get ironed out and the game receives more polish."
1609519592,its a pretty great looking game there is a ok amount of stuff to do around the city with side quest and what not but other then that the world is pretty dead. the npcs are life less and dont talk or do anything around the whole world. the ai is just shit. and the cops in the game nomatter where your at or what your on they will spawn right behind you. there really isnt a whole lot of guns in the game and no matter where i go it seems as for now there are only a few type of guns to pick from in the game. and this is very sad its a 13year game in the making and its 2020 and they can only do a few guns ??? the games a bust for me.
1609519301,"Despite its many bugs, and despite the unreal press hype this received before launch, and despite Keanu Reeves lackluster performance as the eminently unlikeable Johnny Silverhands and, despite the horrible, horrible, so horrible I have to say it thrice, writing, and despite the disgust I felt when the three origin stories made absolutely no difference besides the occasional really terrible dialog, and despite the total sh**-show that piloting a vehicle is and, finally, despite the really terrible decisions made by devs that constantly push this supposed RPG into painfully linear game play....

I like it.

It is a visual smorgasbord of sensuous textures, lighting porn and flashing colors that would make even the most ADHD person in the world and make them just sit back for a moment and relax, taking it all in.

The relatively open world is chock full of little activities that you can do to stave off those heart-rending moments when you want to scream at the writers each time you replay the game. Not only can you be a good guy by helping out the cops, you can do it while being a mindless serial killer that racks up thousands of kills from among the lowlife gangs with absolutely no consequences! Moral ambiguity ahoy!

I think this game is worth the money because when they finally work out most of the bugs, it will have been worth twice the cost and we will have gotten it cheaply. I pick fun at the game because I can, but I honestly did have fun playing and, right now, am doing another run through completing just about every side quest before the game forces me to move ahead with the plot.

Make my conference calls all that much more exciting."
1609519270,"Sorry RED, but this will never be one of my favorites!"
1609519204,The bugs make it better
1609519162,Awesome immersive experience.
1609519155,The first two hours of gameplay is just an introduction to the game and storyline. WTF.
1609519143,"Big world, TONS of stuff to do, many different ways to build your perfect character. come into this game with the mindset of fallout in terms of glitches. other than that the game is a 10/10 IMO"
1609519143,meh
1609519126,"This feels like the kind of game that has the bones to be great, but most of the systems were left half finished.  It's still a decent game, if you're looking for a mindless shooter, but I would wait 6 months for them to improve the systems and get rid of some of the immersion breaking bugs"
1609519070,Not sure what all the complaints are about with this game. Playing it on a 1660ti and haven't had any problems. Only have 6 hours in so far but intend to put more time in. Hope this helps someone make up their mind about playing it. GLHF
1609519028,it like watching a movie that edgy but your into it bec of the hot girls
1609518925,"Despite all of the comments about this game, I have enjoyed it. There are some bugs that I wish were not there but it will get fixed. The story is interesting but I've been caught up with the side quests, very fun game!"
1609518853,this game is unplayable cant even get out of character creation on low settings
1609518848,Fantastic game. Fully immersed myself in it.
1609518823,"Awesome storyline, lots sidequests and the pure roaming around makes it possible to play for hours without getting bored, can only recommend! /o"
1609518785,Its very glitchy but also very enjoyable still. I can't wait until the bring this game to its full potential
1609518517,GAME GUD
1609518441,"Glitchy and buggy, but still, love the game :D"
1609518410,Good game
1609518408,yea
1609518383,"While it's unfortunate that the developers are having such a difficult time with their older-gen console release, I've been playing the game now since its release on the PC and having an amazing time.  There is such an incredible wealth of content, that I've only completed maybe a quarter of the main storyline and keep getting pulled by the side stories.   The voice acting, the look of the world, the stories inside are all amazing and compelling, and I keep looking for different ways to play the game and see the full extent of the world.

There are bugs... but I've mostly encountered small ones on my system.  Misty deals invisible Tarot cards, at some transition points you'll find characters in T-poses, clipping can be an issue when killing enemies (they might fall through the floor and their loot is tantalizingly out of reach)... but overall, the game is a very solid dive into a rich, scary world that's an extremely rewarding game.

I expect 2021 will give us the bug fixes and reveal the masterpiece this project is.

Many thanks to the developers for their long hours-- the work is absolutely up there on the screen."
1609518286,Don't listen to the media this game is great and getting better by the day.
1609518168,"Yes, there are bugs but nothing really show stopping and it is thoroughly enjoyable."
1609518151,"Yes, the launch was really bad but even so there is much to enjoy in Cyberpunk. Quests are really well made, main story and characters are solid and the city is just so well made and packed with content. Would recommend."
1609518065,"Overall Very Impressive Game, Id Rate this game 25+ As it can be very impressionable on young minds."
1609518242,"It's really too bad this game launched the way it did.
It's also too bad it got hyped like crazy by Marketing and amped everyone up...

But you know what? Past that messy launch, past the empty shell of a city, the not so good A.I., and the bugs of varying severity (I must say tho that I've barely had any problems), this game is a gem.

Now here's the thing: the gameplay overall isn't really amazing or ground-breaking. It's generic for the most part.
However, it is saved by the sheer variety of play styles: you can sneak, blast, slash, shoot your way out of situations as you please. It's like playing many games (Doom, Mirror's Edge, CoD, Borderlands) at once.

What makes Cyberpunk 2077 a gem is it's writing, stories, characters and overall art direction (visual and audio).
Never have I ever felt as immersed playing a video game before. 
The experience was truly one of a kind.
There really is something to be said about playing a character exclusively in first person. I wasn't on board at first, but to be honest, it wouldn't have been the same otherwise.

The developers have thought of everything to make you part of the action.
Being able to read characters' emotions, to have meaningful interactions with people, actual relationships that develop over time, impactful storyline that has you so very engaged... No game, in my opinion, has ever reached that level. And it could've even pushed much further.

It's one of those types of medias you feel sad having to let go as the end nears, one that leaves you thinking for hours about the what ifs and the what abouts.

It really is too bad that the open world feels ""empty"" despite the sheer scale of the city and its surroundings. People in the streets feel hollow, barely registering your presence and that of other NPCs. Nothing really pulls you back to Night City.
I must say I am rather pessimistic about it ever being patched. Some things you just can't fix. But who knows.

For now, this game is worth playing exclusively for its story, main and secondary missions included. The gameplay is just extra.
The experience is one of a kind, long enough, and very... Very engaging."
1609518025,"Jase's Cyberpunk 2077 review:

10/10 story; great story had a lot of twists and turns a many option to follow, really good at making connections and really hooking you into the story

10/10 game play; combat is fun as hell could't have asked, for more driving is fun, addictive leveling systems is very nice and selective and they all prove a small challenge to learn and a hard challenge to master

10/10 cinematics and looks; great for telling the story, beautiful graphics really bring the city to life

10/10 characters; character development was amazing you really were able to form a bond with every character and learn more about them

8/10 completion; for the bugs, very few and didn't impact game play for all except 1 which just required loading last checkpoint, most bugs accorded during cut scenes and just involved the using the force to hold objects

overall score: 9.6/10"
1609517952,"I personally think it's a great game as long as you have the hardware to run it. Although, as much as I hate to admit it, it should have been delayed again. It also might have been best to just not release it for previous gen consoles at all (but I know CD investors wouldn't have liked that very much). Hopefully things are better for everyone in the coming months."
1609517948,"Best open access game out there. Can't wait for the full release! Game has more cut content than an emo's wrists, but luckily it was playtested for approximately 5 minutes before getting released for a quick cashout so it's as well balanced as setting a lubed ball on the tip of a pyramid. If you want my opinion on the AI, I'll be sure to let you know when they implement one!

In all honesty though, despite its bugs and flaws, no game has made me laugh as much as this one. And I have had tons of fun playing it. Still recommended."
1609517938,nice
1609517931,"I went into this game pretty blind to all the hype, I had recently played the Witcher 3, and since the game is from the same developer. So my only expectation from this game was that it is as fun and engaging as the Witcher, and it is. 

PRO: The world building is amazing, every side quest is interesting engaging. Those annoying collectable mission are actually fun and give you dialog and information along the way. The design of the different in game areas is rich and colourful and the attention to detail is great. The diverse options of combat and mission approach make it unique and replayable, plus some of the unique weapons are down right silly. 

CON: The game is huge, I run the game on a 1060 so i have to run mostly on the lowest settings. The combat and controls are clunky and slow, I built a melee build and enemy tracking and distance where always off. The UI is a bit tricky to figure out initially since the game doesn't hold your hand. At launch there are some bugs (stuck animation, unable to pick up common loot, driving, ect.) but with the how CD project red supported The Witcher trilogy I expect them to continue to improve Cyberpunk as well."
1609517832,"The game is a Masterpiece and one of the best AAA titles out there,

  BUT,

1) The game needs polishing. Numerous glitches and bugs that while they aren't game breaking they are still annoying.

2) While ''most people can'' play and enjoy this excellent work of a game in their rigs, there are many that simply cannot. Reason of this---> specs. 
From my point of view,this game its not about the stunning visuals (which it has),but for its world/setting and story. My rig its a good 'n old AW machine (though 5 years its not ''that old'' but anyway' ) and it kinda struggles with in-game performance. I'm at the margin of min. specs and i know that i put a lot of pressure on my rig(no issues so far save for a single crush and a couple of freezes-again due to my marginal min. reqs) , and i've just got a feeling that for a game that was in development from something like early 2012, the requirements SHOULD be somewhat less..(er). After all, there are already a lot of other titles - and older ones - that can compete for stunning visuals and the like - Arkham Knight a very good example still in these days. As i said, CP2077 dragged me for its story and setting,not for the promise of stunning visuals.
Also,i happen to know a lot of people that wish to buy and play this game but the Sys Reqs are forbidding for them. And no, they wouldn't spend  hundreds of cash for respecing(or even  buy a new machine) to just play a game.

3) In my opinion,the game has A LOT of content as secondary/side and a little in the main story. I'm on the verge of finishing it and i still do all side/gigs/police quests just to play more and not finishing it. Don't get me wrong, main story is absolutely marvellous, i just got the feeling that its just a VERY SMALL portion of the content comparing to all the other quests. I would prefer a longer main story and fewer side quests. But hey, its just me. 


All in all , and barring those three bullet points , the game is nice. And it's worthy it.  


P.S. waiting for DLC(s)"
1609517817,"Imagine spending millions of dollars on a game that sucks dick. Like beat on the brat missions are so broken you have to sprint around the ring so you dont get killed in one punch that you cant even block, ruins the immersion of an actual fight"
1609517763,"No mater what people say bug patches will not save this game talking about the story









it sucks, the entire story is ""go go go go your gonna die you need to hurry"" but then demands you do side quests and side content to even unlock half of the ending options. the side missions feel completely disjointed and ignorant of the fact that your character is coughing up blood and complaining constantly about headaches, johnny is also a complete dickhead who has no redeeming factors, besides ""i wanted u to die but after spending 1 hour in your head i dont want you to now"". its confusing and so many elements are conflicting with each other like if you go the route of ""fuck you johnny you just want my body"" he'll continue to try and save you like you havent rejected him and that you two are the best of friends. I did 2 play throughs of this game and both times i was confused by the characters around me and just wanted to say fuck this and try to kill them. my first play through was me being nice to johnny and it ended with johnny taking over my body only because v stopped me and i thought ""oh so i cant make that choice"", my second i was a complete asshole to johnny and the same thing happened, v stopped me for whatever reason, i tried the other endings but they just made me feel like i had done nothing the entire game."
1609517725,amazing immersive and realistic
1609517811,"Wake the f*ck up samurai, we have a city to bug.

At it's current state, it's pretty a decent game. Can't wait for devs to patch things up and add DLCs this bad boi."
1609517684,"As it stands now, Cyberpunk 2077 is already a phenomenal, if incomplete, game. After the devs have had a proper amount of time to finish working out all the bugs and add in everything they intend to, I believe it will be one of the best games of its time."
1609518003,"Yes. Yes, I do recommend Cyberpunk. But why?

It's looking fantastic! It is very immersive. The stories are great (if you let them). And most importantly, it's great fun. So much of it. The city. Driving around. Looking at stuff and listening in.

Is it bug-free? No. There are minor glitches here and there (see YouTube videos of cars flying around). Yes, I've been stuck between crates or in a crawl space and needed to load. Currently I've player about 150h and finished 95% of side quests, one of which is actually broken (i.e. can't finish it until patched).

But in no way is it what several shooter kids and media outlets are trying to tell you. It works, it A LOT of fun, if you let it. What do I mean by that? Cyberpunk is [b]not an open-world shooter[/b]. If you kick in every door and start shooting (whether lethal or not), you will experience something like 'everything feels the same'. Yeah, no shit Sherlock! Because you're shooting everybody. Don't and you'll have a lot of fun.

And please ignore those 'I completed the game <100h' reviews trying to tell you it was boring. Shooter kids complaining about their own choices.

PS: Had one game crash around hour 100 of 150 so far."

1609517331,"This game just isn't finished. It feels like a game that was about 60-70% completed when execs decided it needed to be released this instant. So the developers made it as playable as possible within that timeframe pushed the launch button and hoped for the best.

Part of the physics engine are obviously unfinished. 
Parts of the story were obviously trimmed away, with plot threads setup in Act 1 and 2 going nowhere by the game's finale. Similarly, the finale itself feels like it came about 10 missions earlier than it should have, itself being a short 10-minute mission that while visually cool has little sense of finality to it, aside from the Smasher fight.

The PC controls have strange input lag issues that lag down the entire game the longer you play, strangely enough plugging in a controller makes this go away.
The driving model is unfinished, every car feels like a tank. Pedestrian and vehicle AI is basically non-existant. Hell, it was probably better in GTA3.

The skill system and damage calculations are screwed up in ways I can't truly comprehend. It seems that every time I save and reload the game the game comes to massively different conclusions about how much damage I should be doing and taking. The more skills you pick up, the worse this issue becomes and the game rolls some dice to determine how much damage shall be dealt this session.

Animations get wonky, NPCs disappear during cutscenes, start T-posing, dialogue lags for uncomfortably long stretches of time. It goes on and on. If I listed all the bugs I discovered in this game during my playthrough I'd be here all day and break the character limit 15 times over.

Now, I will say that the game looks pretty snazzy and all the characters within it stand out positively. There is little wonky voice acting (aside from Male!V kind of missing the mark on emotional tone here and there, honsetly Fem!V is a much better experience that I'd wholeheartedly recommend) and overpresent characters whose personalities make you cringe, it's all good on that front. 
Side quests are interesting and varied and break away from the RPG-tried-and-true fetch quest hurricane, that even CDPR's previous title (The Witcher 3) was not shy to abuse and reuse a million times over. Not so here, exploring the side quests is something I wholeheartedly recommend, as I found more enjoyment there than the rather incredibly short main storyline (if you don't bother with the sidequests you can be done in about 4 hours). Several of the side quest chains also tie into the story's ending and unlock additional epliogues to explore.

In the end, I'd say this game was released at least a year before it was truly ready. It looks, feels and plays like it's in its alpha stage and that's unfortunate because there is a LOT of potential here. But it's bogged down with poor performance, trimmed down story and an engine that's barely holding together at the seams.

If you're currently looking for a rock-solid experience in the Cyberpunk genre, I'd direct you to Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Mankind Divided instead, which makes much better use of its' setting to integrate cyberware and gameplay and Cyberpunk 2077 obviously looked at these titles for inspiration when crafting its own setting. 
If you aren't shy about ancient graphics and visuals I'd point to the original Deus Ex first and foremost."
1609517297,so what the launch was messy so what theres bugs thats modern day gaming but this story and playthrough in my opinion game of 2020

1609517037,"Anyone who is only talking about the bugs right now is a massive Gonk. Great story and an even greater city, Choon."
1609517028,"There is one key thing that this game did very well, that is to teach me to NEVER pre-order games."
1609516909,Good. Not great but not bad.
1609516857,"Even with the many bugs, I think its still a great game, with a lot to experience."
1609516698,"Beautiful game. Missions/combat are fun and challenging on the appropriate difficulty. The story is intriguing and I genuinely want to know how the hell it turns out. You can get lost forever, in a good way, doing all kinds of side quests with their own interesting story lines and characters. I have yet to encounter a game breaking bug. Should these asshiles have done more testing before release? Yes. Do I regret that $60? No."
1609516597,I think it is amazing. And it has a lot of potential.
1609516554,Great shape on G14. No issues here and can play on Raytrace Ultra (with 35 fps) or Raytrace Med (50 fps)

1609516225,"Decent game with decent story, I personally got lucky and experienced minimal bugs. But if your PC can run it, definitely worth picking up."
1609516214,Played 41 hours. Completed the game without a single glitch
1609516126,"This isn't an RPG.  An RPG means that the decisions you make influence and change the world around you.  That isn't the case in this game.  This is an action-adventure game that is so imbalanced, it's laughable.  It's so exploitable, it's hard to play the game legitimately.  I haven't finished the story yet, but the many problems with the game overshadow the good parts of the game.  Wait until the community fixes the game.  Obviously, CDPR doesn't care about it.  If they had, they wouldn't have released this dumpster fire and mislead their customer base."
1609516121,"For all it's flaws, it still is a bloody good game. Spend every minute of free time I had in Night City.
Side/''companion'' quests are the best. Everyone you meet through them has a very distinct personality and background. 
Fixer quests are a tad dull, but I guess they're supposed to be superficial. 

Only hit a slight hitch when my game seemed to crash at fixed points in night city. Which has been fixed.

All in all a very enjoyable trip. Starting up my second play through right now!"
1609516025,"Ahh Cyberpunk, I was waiting for this game for years to come since they did show the teaser of that title back in 2013. I'm talking about this one right here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P99qJGrPNLs
But let's move to reviewing the game itself and it's aspects surrounding it.

We all know that the game wasn't launched at it's best state, And still there is a decent of bugs that even the casual can trigger by simply playing the game. Some may require the player to load the previous save due to an issue that won't the player to keep progress within the game, weird graphical glitches and the list goes on.
The game is indeed not yet completed and CDPR has a long road when it comes to solving all of those problems

None the less, It's a great title and playing it was a blast that I didn't for a very long time with gaming.
CDPR did try to innovative and hell they did it right. While they did use some of their ideas from their ""The Witcher"" series. They did bring to us some new elements to the table and does change the way we play the game.

Cyberpunk 2077 is all driven by it's main story and really does encourage the player to listen carefully through the dialogues and get interested about it and even to select every option just to listen for the sake of learning more about the characters in question. While I believe that Night City has a lot to offer when it comes to depth. It feels lackluster at some point and CDPR could really use more attention in that regard

Graphics and optimization, This game can be seen by now as the modern age ""Crysis"". It certainly won't run at an acceptable experience on a weak hardware. While I managed to experience the game in all of it's glory in Maxed out settings (i9 9900K and RTX 3080) and was stunned by the visuals and the performance I was getting (Thanks DLSS for being a thing) I'm in the small percentage who can run the game in the way it's developer intended to do. the majority would have a rough time with that.
However, there are optimization issues for some older hardware like NVIDIA's GTX 10 series which can have some worrying performance despite the raw power in those cards and if you do, Disable ASync Compute via a third party mod as Pascal was never designed to use such feature.

Soundtrack, CDPR did an amazing job with the Witcher games in that aspect and it remains just as good with Cyberpunk 2077. The careful selection of the proper music is really being present across all stages of the game and turns out even the Radio has nice stuff to listen by.

Features, As I did say before. Cyberpunk does really miss some features and some of those are very needed. CDPR did promise a big amount of interesting features to make the gaming experience more interesting but sadly most of those didn't make the cut or did but done very poorly/limited. for example, the ""Police"" system does barely exist and honestly is a complete joke when you compare it to GTA San Andreas that came back in 2004 and the list goes on. With that I certainly did expect more.

With all of the mess that the game had during it's development and then it's launch. It certainly feels that the game isn't finished and could be delayed by another few months. a lot of it's aspects does feel ""underdeveloped"" and could be done much better but still. I did try my best to overlook to focus on it's core gameplay and my final rating?

Overall, 8/10. the core gameplay experience was great, the story with it as well. I do recommend everyone to give a try for the game. It has been a great experience and I enjoyed every moment playing it.
But remember that CDPR has a long way ahead to fix and ship the remaining parts of Cyberpunk. I do look forward for playing the DLC in the future.

Thanks for reading, Hope you would have a great time in Night City!"

1609515938,This is a Great game .... just don't listen to anyone
1609515789,yes
1609515538,"Doesn't even run. Instant crash and offer of anonymous report. 2021 got an even shittier start for me.

Specs: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2400S CPU @ 2.50GHz 3.20GHz; RAM 24.0 Gb; Win 10 Pro (64)

Maybe its because of the processor, no idea. Refund for now."
1609515534,"Is this game perfect? No
Is this game fun? Yes

With fair reasons, a lot of people have been put off by all the negative press surrounding Cyberpunk 2077's troubled launch; particularly on last gen consoles. But on PC its worth it if you have a semi-decent rig. The story is good and very in-depth with the lore it uses and the gameplay when you're in combat with enemies is enjoyable the more you unlock in terms up weapon and cyberware upgrades. The modding community is slowly and gradually building for this one as well, which is usually a draw for PC players. Bugs and glitches do exist, but they are being fixed by CDPR and the game is becoming better and more stable.

I'm 30 hours in and still barely scratching the surface of everything in the main and side quests. Any game that I can get more than 15 hours into without being put off or bored, it gets a thumbs up from me."
1609518132,"Before we start there is spoiler below you gonk so think again before you read. And if you just wanted to see what I think about the game overall scroll to the end. Starts in...

3...

2...

1...

Here goes nothing...

The game has nearly same open world as we have in Witcher 3. Contracts replaced with GIGs, monster dens and bandit camps replaced with NCPD assaults and crime scenes etc. It is not hard to realize if you played both games. And just like Witcher 3 ""I DID NOT GOT BORED WHILE DOING GIGS OR WHATEVER SINCE THEY WERE NOT REPEATING THEMSELVES"" (wanted to make that clear sorry for caps). So for the open world I can say it was helluva good job from CDPR (congrats chooms).

About the main story. Well it was not the best main story I've seen gotta admit. And also not the longest one. So I can say that they could made a better storyline by making it longer and more detailed. For example they could add more gameplay or cutscene that is not playable about Johnny's past. I mean all we saw was sexy netrunner who had sex with Johnny getting kidnapped and Johnny placed a big boom in the elevator. Anyway cutting the crap I liked the main story BUT could be much better I understand people do not thinking the same since they were overhyped for the game. So there is lesson to be learn not just for CDPR but also for us gamers. DO NOT OVERHYPE FOR ANYTHING no matter what the game is or who the publisher is.

Weapons were meh in overall but there were a lot of trash weapon like wtf is smart shotgun I really like shotguns in games (*heavy DOOM intensifies*) but as they say there is first time for everything. But if you wanna use them just put your perks on the right skill and you will get tons of damage. What I did? I put them all on hacking and tab+f did the job for me.
Driving a fast car is a nightmare either too much on the throttle end up hitting somewhere/making donuts all the way or drive it slowly (then why the fast car?). But you are getting use to it after a lot of training and by driving the car not with first person view. Driving motorcycle however is really awesome especially from the first person view.

Bugs and optimization... I have 1050Ti, i7-8750H and 24GB ram with 2400MHz. Mostly got 27 fps but sometimes it was dropping around 20 (mostly in beat on the brat missions I dunno why). But to be honest IT WAS NOT UNPLAYABLE and mostly smooth. But this change nothing we all know they could have done way better than this.
And about the bugs, there is always bugs in all games and there will be. I sometimes stuck in places where I shouldn't like passing under an object while crouching and sometimes a car spawned on my car just after I parked it and all I did was saying ""okay"" with a smile on my face then keep playing. I only got a huge bug once which occurred after I finished a GIG for padre. I was talking about the GIG with padre and instantly loading screen appeared after load finished I spawned in the sky falling to ground then another loading screen then back to where I were before the first loading screen and padre talking to me like nothing happened. Anyway as a result nothing to say about bugs but optimization could be better (I know there will be patch to fix that problem).

For the ones who scroll to the bottom to see a sum:

Open World - 9/10
Story - 8/10
Mechanics - 7/10
Overall - 8.5/10

Worth to buy. I did enjoy. Hope you will too."
1609515018,"I had sex with a guy accidentally.

5/5"
1609516037,"What I love:

 CDProjekt is FANTASTIC at story telling and world building. The world is DETAILED, and presented in a way that makes it all seem happenstance, like it doesn't revolve around you. 

The mission and story elements are engaging and the events that unfold can be very unexpected.

Diversity in character builds with many skill paths. You both invest attribute points where you want as well as earn them for skill you use most. Early on I was told my character wouldn't do well hacking first and shooting second. I'm a glass cannon but it works :)

Loot, tons of loot.

I love the music, even the stuff I wouldn't otherwise listen to, it all seems to fit with the world.

What I don't like:

UI could be improved, but it is manageable. At first it was hard to figure out which screen to go to to complete an action. Picking up items. It can be very hard to select the item you want to pick up if two are close together.

Bugs. I've yet to find anything game breaking, but they happen with enough frequency I'm always expecting something to happen. Examples: traffic may stop spawning leaving roads empty, UI markers will remain on screen when they should disappear until a reload, and NPCs floating in the air. 

AI. Non-enemy NPCs (crowds) are dumb. Park your car on a sidewalk and create a traffic jam of pedestrians. Enemy AI is OK in battle, they take cover, throw grenades and rush with melee, but they are very easy to outsmart.

One last nitpick: if you're trying to stealth you had better hide the bodies. Enemies will ""see"" dead/incapacitated bodies a mile away through objects.

The shortcomings don't come close to outweighing the strengths. I love BEING in the world, discovering the details and where the next story will lead. I'm having a blast devastating my foes with hard earned mind hacks and finishing the stragglers with a well timed shotgun blast. Maybe not for you if you prefer the pace of multiplayer games or don't care for sci-fi, but I can't wait for DLC and what's to come."
1609514976,"bruh nah, not worth it. 8 fucking years for this?"
1609514942,panam's a$$
1609514871,"Sure it was a glitch fest upon release (And at the time of this review and beyond) but the game is absolutely huge and lets you be who you wanna be in the confines of a bustling high-tech but corrupt mega-city.
At the time of making this review I've only done the prologue and the training and even then I still spent more time trying to figure out why my RTX 2060 couldn't run this game beyond 30fps, only to realise it was trying to output in 4K. However when its running at an optimal performance, its great fun.

Still though, you should probably wait longer if you're looking to buy this, let it update and become more polished unless you know what you're about to get yourself into and either don't mind or you are looking for glitch content."
1609514793,bug和阉割太多，优化不行
1609663626,"Me and my friends were all excited to play this game to the point that we all watched lore videos, decided which life path to choose from, and told each other what play styles will each of us are going to pursue (melee, gunner, assassin etc). I am 60+ hrs now into the game and enjoyed it so much. However, after knowing what CD Projekt Red promised what this game will offer (like next gen AI, complex choices etc) and all the cut content and some issues on launch, I would have to give this one a thumbs down because it felt like we did not get to experience the REAL Cyberpunk 2077 experience. 

I really don't mind the glitches and bugs surrounding this game because I know those things will be patched. What really made me sad are the missing contents.. This game has so SOOOO much potential and I hope it will get better soon. 

TLDR:
I do not recommend it FOR NOW."
1609514601,"It's riddled with bugs, and obviously not finished. But I've enjoyed the heck out of the game so far. To have it completely finished, it probably should have been delayed for another year. The hype grew too big, and people got greedy, so it was pushed through. I can't say whether or not you should buy this game in its current state. You may enjoy yourself like I did, you may get too annoyed after an hour. Nothing so far has been game-breaking, and I've been very lucky in my experience.

1609514166,"I love it !
For the endings and everything.
Not finish yet with it but it will be."
1609537576,"Before that, I want to say that English is not my first language, apologies if I have any grammar or spelling error for this review.

Despite of many bugs and unpolished features I have experienced from this game, I would still recommend this game to someone who have never play it. This game is really beautiful. The environment, the story, the characters, world settings and etc. 

I personally really love the aesthetic design choice they made for this game, especially how the night city looks like overall and the color combination they choose for the main characters. For example,  [spoiler] If you play as V, your HUD color will be Cyan and dark pink. If you play as Johnny Sliverhand, the HUD color will be Purple and Yellow. [/spoiler] There are many times that I found my self just stop progressing the quest and walk around the night city just to admire the scenery. Night City feels alive. The graphics is also amazing with my RTX2070. 

The story is one of the main reason why I love this game so much. As someone who loves intriguing story. They did a great job writing the story for this game, the main quest as well as the side quest. It makes you to have emotional bond with the characters despite some of them not being the part of the main story. Though there are some parts you can tell that its cut from the game last minute. For example: [spoiler] There was a dialouge with Claire the bartender from AfterLife where she said she would treat you the drink with the recipe that Jackie gave. After the end of the dialouge, I thought there would be a animation where she will make the drink for you to drink it for Jackie. It didn't happen which is really a let down [/spoiler]. There are also many similar situations like this in some part of the story that was felt unnatural because of the rushed release.

I love the sound tracks they made for this game. It fits well with the theme and portray the characters and the story. It also bring out the emotional tone for the story as well. I also like how the devs make the effort to let real life singers and band to taking part to play the songs which you can hear them in the in-game game radios. The voice acting are really great too. 

Gameplay wise was a okay for me, the skill point system felt okay too, there is nothing really special about it. The driving system feels a bit annoying sometimes because the minimap was zoomed way too close and there are many times I can overshoot the turn. The GPS system is not that great either, sometimes it makes you to drive unnecessary extra miles just to get to your destination even though there are short cuts. Combat and weapon system feels okay too. I dislike how in the main mission they would throw you an incredible scene and then proceed to do the bare minimum of it after. The AI system is terrible, there are times where you can accidentally kill a civilian because they will run into your shooting range during an outdoor gunfight and give you a wanted status, which ""teleport"" the police to you and get you killed.

As for the bugs. Well, personally I have high tolerance for the bugs so it doesn't really bother me that much but I can't say that others will not. Sometimes I would enjoy the bugs because they are funny to me (T-posing, car flying towards you and etc). If you cannot stand bugs like this, I would recommend you to get this game only after the devs have patches most of the major bugs.

In conclusion, I give it a 8 out of 10. This game is great but a rushed game.  CDPR should have delay the game to further to polish this game. This game is such a waste potential. It saddens me that this game is just another example of the consequences of a bad decision making made by the game companies leadership because of their greediness. Its still a great game nonetheless and I will still recommend it to others."
